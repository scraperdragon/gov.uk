Transport Direct's main area of advertising has been through online display advertising and search engines such as Google. Since 2005 Transport Direct has run advertising campaigns using two online elements - online search and display advertising. Currently we are not running a campaign due to Government-wide moratorium on marketing and advertising activities.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/business-indicators,8,"## About DfT's indicators

The Department has adopted the following input and impact indicators, listed by Coalition priority, as set out in our [Business plan](http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/dft-business-plan/). Input indicators show the cost to the Government of delivering certain products and services. Impact indicators show the performance or output of public services. These indicators aim to provide useful information to enable transport users and the wider public to make informed choices, and to make up their own minds about how the Department and transport service operators are running.

Description Type of data Publication frequency

**General indicators**

[Percentage of DfT's approved project spend that is assessed as high or very high value for money](http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/dft-business-plan-indicators-input-06/)

Impact indicator

Quarterly

[Average new car CO2 emissions](http://www.dft.gov.uk/statistics/tables/veh0256/)

Other key data

Annual

**Promote sustainable aviation**

Aviation emissions make up part of the general impact indicator 'Total greenhouse gas emissions from transport', and can be identified separately within that data set. A number of further metrics are published by the [Civil Aviation Authority](http://www.caa.co.uk).

**Reform the Coastguard and search and rescue capability**

It is not practicable to measure the performance of this Structural Reform Priority until after the Coastguard has been reformed and the search and rescue capability is in place.

**Implement the Department's key cross-cutting reform priorities**

[Households with good transport access to key services or work](http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/dft-business-plan-indicators-impact-07/)

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/carbon-calculator,9,"> The carbon calculator is a standalone programme that contains default values for the carbon emissions associated with various types of biofuels. It allows fuel suppliers to calculate the carbon saved on a batch of fuels, as an alternative to looking up values in the C&S guidance tables. It should reduce the potential for errors.

> Build: 106 (Ver 4.5), release date: August 2012
> 
>   * [Download the carbon calculator (ZIP - 2200KB)](http://assets.dft.gov.uk/publications/carbon-calculator/uk-carbon-calc-setup.zip)
> 
> The calculator uses the RTFO lifecycle analysis methodology for Years 1 and 2 (2008/09 and 2009/10). From Year 3 (2010/11) the lifecycle analysis methodology laid out in the EU Renewable Energy Directive (RED) is applied. The latest version aligns the LCA methodology further with that of the RED (from 15 Dec 2011 or Year 4.5 in the tool).
> 
> ## Carbon calculator features
> 
>   * Calculate the carbon intensity of your biofuel on a consignment basis as required by the administrator.
>   * Includes all the biofuels, feedstocks and biofuel production processes listed in RED Annex V and includes every default and input value within the calculations.
>   * Includes emissions from cultivation by NUTS2 region and biofuel feedstock.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/community-rail-routes,12,"## Summary

The Department has formally designated thirty four lines or services.

Designation encourages appropriate standards and excludes the lines from some elements of EU regulation. It provides a more flexible approach to the management of the franchise and allows more flexible arrangements on timetables and fares for example. Designation reinforces the importance and status of the Community Rail Partnership for the line. Designation of services serves similar ends but does not include track or signaling.

Designation follows a consultation process with key local and rail industry stakeholders and endorsement by the National Community Rail Development Implementation Steering Group.

  * The annual reliability measure consistently increased up to March 2012, but has fallen in the last five months, and is now similar to the level observed at the end of 2011. The recent downward trend in reliability reflects the substantial amount of rainfall experienced in spring and summer 2012, compared with the same period in 2011. Recent decreases in reliability are also explained in part by updated journey reference times in April 2012.

## Background information

This indicator monitors the reliability of journeys made on Highways Agency's motorway and A road network.

The indicator is measured by the percentage of 'journeys' on these roads that are 'on time'. For this measure:

  * A 'journey' represents travel between adjacent junctions on the network.
  * An 'on time journey' is defined as one which is completed within a set reference time, drawn from historic data on that particular section of road.
  * Reference journey times are updated for the April data each year. Further information on the impact of updating reference times can be found in section 3 of the latest Statistical Release

At present, information about the reliability of journeys on individual routes, or between particular junctions on the network, are not sufficiently robust to be presented as official statistics. This is due to the range of different sources used to calculate journey times across the network.

The Department is working with the Highways Agency to address these issues of comparability. It is likely that any actions to address these issues will also require some historic adjustment to the national series although the trends reported in national reliability to date are unlikely to change.

Until this programme is complete, the Highways Agency will publish information about journey time reliability at a sub-national level through the data.gov.uk webpage.

Between 16 September 2012 and 13 October 2012, 98.3 per cent of c2c services arrived on time, the highest figure for any DfT franchised train operator. Virgin Trains had the lowest figure with 86.0 per cent of trains on time.

Following restrictions brought in after the Hatfield crash in October 2000, PPM fell sharply across the country, and took nearly a decade to recover to previous levels. Since 2008/09 national PPM has generally been above 90 per cent.

  * [PPM CSV file (21 KB)](http://assets.dft.gov.uk/publications/proportion-of-trains-running-on-time/proportion-of-trains-on-time.csv)

## Background information

The Public Performance Measure (PPM) combines figures for punctuality and reliability into a single performance record. It covers all scheduled franchised passenger services, seven days a week and measures the arrival punctuality of individual trains against their planned timetable. These plans, technically called ""plan of the day"", are usually the same as the published timetable with amendments reflecting pre-published engineering amendments; however, they may differ from their originally published timetable. The reliability figure records the percentage of services that are cancelled.

PPM represents the percentage of trains which are 'on time' compared to the total number of trains planned. A train is defined as on time if it arrives at its destination within five minutes of the scheduled destination arrival time for London and South East and regional operators; or within ten minutes for long-distance operators.

PPM can fluctuate widely period-by-period for many reasons, many of which are not within the control of the train operators. For example poor PPM performance can also be caused by other train operators or Network Rail. More information is available from the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) and on Network Rail's and individual operators' websites. PPM data can be expressed as either for the time period, or as a Moving Annual Average (MAA) which is an average for the most recent 13 four-week reporting periods. MAA figures smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight the annual background.

## Background information

The figures published for this indicator are the emissions from the basket of greenhouse gases covered by the Kyoto Protocol. In accordance with international reporting protocols, each of the gases is weighted by its global warming potential relative to that of carbon dioxide and presented in terms of the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide.

The data are compiled by DECC and its contractors on a calendar year basis due to the reporting timetable of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the EU. The methodology behind the compilation from all sources, also agreed with the UNFCCC, takes some time to work through and final results for the calendar year 2010 were published in February 2012. Results for 2011 will be published in early 2013.

## Latest data

  * In 2011, 1,901 people were killed, 3 per cent (51) greater than in 2010. The number of fatalities increased for pedestrians, and car occupants, by 12 per cent and 6 per cent respectively, but decreased for pedal cyclists and motorcyclists, by 4 per cent and 10 per cent respectively. Over the same period motor vehicle traffic remained broadly stable. Compared with the 2005-9 average, the number killed in 2011 was 32 per cent lower.
  * 2011 saw the first annual increase in fatalities since 2003, but this year's figure remains below the 2009 figure of 2,222. Adverse weather (heavy snow falls) experienced in the first and last quarters of 2010 but not in 2011 are likely to be a factor in the increase in fatalities recorded in 2011.
  * For reported road accidents in year-ending March 2012; there were 1,870 road fatalities, a 1 per cent drop from the year-ending March 2011 figure of 1,881.

## Background information

The indicator can be broken down by any geographical area (e.g. country, region, local authority) since a grid reference is collected for each accident. Information is also available by age, gender, type of road user and road type. Numbers will be relatively small for more detailed breakdowns of the total and may therefore fluctuate from year to year. This needs to be taken into account when assessing trends.

  * [Region](http://www.dft.gov.uk/statistics/tables/acs0110)
  * [Local authority](http://www.dft.gov.uk/statistics/tables/acs0111)

The 2011 score is slightly down from 100 in 2010. This suggests that there has been a decrease in accessibility to key services. The decrease in accessibility could be as a result of a decrease in the frequency of public transport services or the number of routes; closures or relocation of key service locations; or improvements to service destinations dataset. Although the number of bus service trips in England decreased between 2010 and 2011, it is likely that the latter two factors will have had the greatest affect on accessibility.

## Background information

This indicator incorporates information on car availability alongside walking, cycling, and public transport options to give an overall measure of how the Department's policies encourage economic growth and reduce social exclusion.

If the accessibility of the services included in the indicator to the population improves, then the value of the index will increase. If accessibility decreases, the index will decrease.

Data from 2007 onwards have been compiled using consistent methods. However, there have been improvements in data quality and coverage during these years, so changes in reported accessibility may not be entirely attributable to local transport interventions. Further details are available in section 3 of the guidance notes in the Related Information section below. Only registered public transport services are included in the Accessibility calculations. This means Demand Responsive Transport, other flexibly routed services, and school transport services are usually not included. Therefore, especially in rural areas, Accessibility Indicators are likely to be an underestimate of actual accessibility.

The 961 ultra-low emission vehicles registered for the first time in quarter 2 2012 represents an increase of 53 per cent from the figure of 628 in the same quarter of the previous year. Most of these vehicles use electric engines, so the Plug-In Car Grant introduced by DfT in January 2011, and an increase in the supply of electric cars to the UK market will have contributed to this increase.

  * [CSV file for table VEH0170 (2 KB)](http://assets.dft.gov.uk/publications/number-of-newly-registered-ultra-low-emissions-vehicles/veh0170.csv)

## Background information

The Department for Transport uses the term 'ultra-low emission vehicles' to refer to vehicles with significantly lower levels of tailpipe emissions than conventional vehicles. In practice, the term currently refers to electric, plug-in hybrid and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles. Vehicles that use non-fossil fuel propulsion have zero tailpipe emissions. For other propulsion types, only vehicles with tailpipe emissions below 75 grams per kilometre are included. The figures are produced from DVLA's and DVA's new registration system and only vehicles being registered in Great Britain or Northern Ireland for the first time are included.

There is a high level of seasonal variation in new vehicle registrations (for example higher sales when registration plates change in September and April), therefore it is misleading to compare data for consecutive quarters. Comparisons should be made with the same quarter of previous years.

## DfT Business Plan input indicator

### Geographical coverage: DfT franchised train operators (Great Britain)

### Information broken down by: Train operator and type of subsidy

## Latest data

The total subsidy to DfT franchised train operators was 7.5 pence per passenger mile in 2011/12, down from 8.1 pence per passenger mile in 2010/11.

For this indicator, total subsidy includes:

  * **(a) Subsidy paid directly to train operators by Government**
  * Figures published by the Office of Rail Regulation based on passenger kilometres, converted to miles.
  * **(b) An allocation of the Network Grant (that is, payments made directly to Network Rail)**
  * This is calculated by taking the total Network Grant, apportioned according to each franchise's share of Fixed Track Access Charges.

For the second year running, in 2011/12 First Capital Connect was the only train operator with a negative subsidy per passenger mile, meaning that it paid government a larger premium than the effective subsidy it received via the Network Grant payment to Network Rail.

Northern Rail received the highest subsidy per passenger mile of 34.9 pence per mile in 2011/12.

  * [Subsidy per passenger mile CSV file (4 KB)](http://assets.dft.gov.uk/publications/rail-subsidy-per-passenger-mile/rail-subsidy.csv)

## Background information

This indicator provides information about the amount of subsidy paid to Train Operating Companies, both directly by the Department for Transport and indirectly via grants to Network Rail.

There is no recognised rule for allocating the network grant across franchises. The distribution of Fixed Track Access Charges has been used to allocate the Network Grant by train operator.

  * In 2010/11, the average level of subsidy (direct from central government) per passenger journey was 9.1 pence. This decreased (adjusted for inflation) from 10.1 pence in 2004/05. 
  * English non-Metropolitan areas had the highest level of subsidy per passenger journey (14.5 pence in 2010/11), London had the lowest level of subsidy per passenger journey (4.8 pence in 2010/11) while English Metropolitan areas were in-between (12.0 pence in 2010/11). Comparisons between London and the rest of the country should be made with care - see note in Background Information below.

## Background information 

Lower subsidy per passenger journey will indicate better value for the public purse. However, this could arise as a result of reductions in the most heavily subsidised services - many of which are routes in rural areas which would be unprofitable without public subsidy. Reductions to these services would improve the 'headline' measure but would risk making rural communities more isolated.

The figures exclude expenditure on capital projects (e.g. bus lane priority schemes) which benefit the bus industry directly or indirectly. Outside London, the local bus industry is deregulated, but London runs an entirely tendered bus market under the oversight of Transport for London. Given the different market structures, comparisons between London and the rest of country should be made with considerable care.

The indicator is calculated by dividing the total Bus Service Operators' Grant by the total passenger journeys on buses (this will include concessionary journeys). Further information is available in the measurement template (below).

In 2011-12, maintenance costs associated with this measure increased by an additional 5 per cent compared with 2010-11. This additional activity had been planned and budgeted for in the Spending Review. The main elements of the increase were a planned increase in the M25 PFI service payments and increased capital renewals. Expenditure on maintenance, particularly in relation to capital renewals, reflects the varying demands of maintenance activity which is not necessarily comparable year-on-year.

## Background information

The movement between 2010-11 and 2011-12 maintenance indicators mainly reflect changes in expenditure which highlights the varying expenditure demands of the programme of works. Movements in operating costs mainly result from changes in vehicle miles each year.

Variability in the maintenance indicator is due to complex factors that cannot be easily attributed to the results. Expenditure reflects the varying demands of the programme of works in each region and the underlying condition of the network is therefore a key factor. Similarly, the number of lane miles can give no information about the nature of those lane miles eg geography, terrain, construction, age, etc. and how many and what type of structures they contain.

**Maintenance Costs** derived from the Highways Agency Management Accounts include: All Renewal of Roads and Structures expenditure: A proportion of the Managing Agent Contractor's Routine and Winter Maintenance expenditure: A proportion of the PFI/DBFO Service Payments calculated from contract data: All Technology Maintenance and Renewals expenditure.

The number of lane miles is derived from the Highways Agency Pavement Management System (HAPMS).

## Notes

### Operating costs

(a) These data are based on each operator's statutory accounts. Any figures relating to premia or associated payments to the Department for Transport or Passenger Transport Executives are excluded.

(b) For each operator, the latest available statutory accounts have been used. As indicated above, the periods covered by each set of accounts do not always match. Because of this, **it is not appropriate to sum up each item to derive a total cost**.

(c) Although we have aimed to be as consistent as possible, operators may not treat all aspects of operating costs in the same way in their accounts, and so care should be taken when using these figures.

### Network Grant

(d) This is calculated by taking the total network grant in 2010-11, and allocating it to each franchise based on their share of Fixed Track Access Charges.

## Background information

The ""Operating cost"" column shows the costs incurred by each Train Operating Company (TOC) associated with running their services; this is based on operators' statutory accounts, and excludes any premia or subsidy. Within this total are payments made by operators to Network Rail for access to the rail network which contribute towards infrastructure costs.

The ""Allocated Network Grant"" column, allocates, to each operator, the grant paid by the Department for Transport to Network Rail in 2010-11. The grant effectively pays the infrastructure costs incurred by Network Rail that are not covered by operators. In the table above, each operator is allocated a share of the grant in proportion to their Fixed Track Access Charge.

### The following file contains these figures for each of the DfT franchised train operators:

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/dft-complaints-procedure,27,"## Making a complaint

The Department aims to provide a high quality of service to the public. Please let us know if you feel we have not achieved that aim and we will do our best to put things right. Feedback - both good and bad - helps us continue to improve our service.

If your complaint is about the policies of the Department or the service you have received from the central part of the Department (not one of the executive agencies), the guidance below explains who you should complain to and how we will deal with your complaint.

  * [Contact us](/about/contact/)

Alternatively, you can ask your MP to take up your complaint with the Secretary of State for Transport.

If the service is provided by one of our executive agencies, you will need to get in touch with that agency direct. Each of the Agencies has its own complaints procedure and the central Department is not able to deal with, or comment on, complaints about the service provided by any of the DfT agencies.

  * [Making a complaint to the executive agencies](/about/contact/complaints/#agencies)

## Complaints about our policies in the central Department for Transport

Please note that the Complaints Officer cannot consider a complaint regarding policy. Sending your complaint direct to the Complaints Officer will delay the handling of your complaint.

### Step 1

If you have a complaint about our service, the best way to resolve it will usually be through the officer you have been dealing with. You can do this over the phone, by email or in writing.

### Step 2

If you feel that this is not the right way to resolve your complaint, or you have already tried and are not satisfied with the outcome, you should make a formal written complaint to the Head of the Division you have been dealing with.

The contact details for our staff are available through our [Enquiry Service](/about/contact/#dft).

The division should acknowledge your complaint within five working days and will aim to provide a full response within 20 working days.

Please contact the Enquiry Service on 0300 330 3000 if you need any help in making a complaint.

### Step 3

If you remain dissatisfied, you can contact an MP to contact the Parliamentary and Health Services Ombudsman on your behalf who will decide whether or not to take up your case.

## Complaints about our service or staff members in the central Department for Transport

### Step 1

If you have a complaint about our service, the best way to resolve it will usually be through the officer you have been dealing with. You can do this over the phone, by email or in writing.

### Step 2

If you feel that this is not the right way to resolve your complaint, or you have already tried and are not satisfied with the outcome, you should make a formal written complaint to the Head of the Division you have been dealing with.

The contact details for our staff are available through our Enquiry Service.

The division should acknowledge your complaint within five working days and will aim to provide a full response within 20 working days.

### Step 3

If you remain dissatisfied and your complaint is solely about the quality of the service we have provided or a member of our staff, you can contact the DfT complaints team at [Dftcomplaints@dft.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:Dftcomplaints@dft.gsi.gov.uk)

The Complaints Officer is independent of the policy and operational divisions in the Department and will look at your complaint with a fresh pair of eyes. The complaints officer can only investigate a complaint once steps 1 an 2 have been exhausted and only complaints regarding poor service or conduct within the central Department. Please note that the Complaints Officer cannot consider a complaint regarding policy.

The address to write to is:

Complaints Officer  
Department for Transport  
D/01, Ashdown House  
Sedlescombe Road North  
St Leonards on Sea  
East Sussex  
TN37 7GA

Email: [dftcomplaints@dft.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:dftcomplaints@dft.gsi.gov.uk)  
Telephone: 0300 330 3000

The Complaints Officer will acknowledge your complaint within five working days. As part of the investigation your complaint will be discussed with the Division you dealt with originally. Recommendations will then be made to the division on how best to resolve your complaint and, if appropriate, measures will be put in place to prevent the same thing happening again.

Following this you will receive our final response, which should be within 20 working days of your complaint being received. If we need longer, we will let you know why and when to expect our final reply.

## What to do if you remain dissatisfied

If, after the response from the complaints team, you remain unhappy with the service the Department has provided you should contact any [Member of Parliament](http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/mps/) to refer the complaint to the [Parliamentary and Health Services Ombudsman (PHSO)](http://www.ombudsman.org.uk/about-us/contact-us/) on your behalf.

## Freedom of Information Act 2000, Environmental Information Regulations 2004, Data Protection Act

### Step 1

If you are unhappy with the way the Department has handled your request for information (i.e., an FOI request or a request handled under the Environmental Information Regulations), or with the decisions made in relation to your request, you may complain by writing to the Department's Information Rights Unit at:

Zone D/01  
Ashdown House  
Sedlescombe Road North  
Hastings  
East Sussex TN37 7GA

E-mail: [FOI-Advice-Team-DFT@dft.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:FOI-Advice-Team-DFT@dft.gsi.gov.uk)

An independent DfT official who was not involved in making the original decision will then carry out an internal review of the Department's handling of your request. We aim to complete Internal Reviews within 20 working days, although in complex cases we may occasionally require longer. The independent reviewer will write to you setting out their decision.

You should also write to the same address if you have a complaint regarding the operation of the Department's publication scheme.

### Step 2

If you are dissatisfied with the results of DfT's internal review, you may appeal to the [Information Commissioner](http://www.ico.gov.uk/).

If you have a query about the outcome of a Data Protect Act query please contact the [Data Protection Officer](/publications/dft-accessing-information/).

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/dsa-driver-cpc-statistics,36,"These statistics are produced by the Driving Standards Agency (DSA), which administers the driving test system in Great Britain.

Unlike most other Department for Transport (DfT) statistics, driving test statistics are compiled and published by staff in the DSA using data from the agency's operational systems. Statisticians in the central Department are not involved in their production and, as such, these statistics are not directly overseen by the DfT Head of Profession.

We are exploring options to regularise these arrangements for the future and would welcome the views of current or prospective users of driving test statistics. Please direct any comments to [vehicles.stats@dft.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:vehicles.stats@dft.gsi.gov.uk)

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/dsa-operational-statistics,40,"These Driving Standards Agency (DSA) operational statistics show information which has not been designated as an [official statistic](http://www.dft.gov.uk/statistics?post_type=release&series=driving-tests-and-instructors). 

The statistics come from data held by the DSA which administers the driving test scheme in Great Britain. 

Unlike most other Department for Transport (DfT) statistics, these statistics are compiled and published by staff in DSA using data from the agency's operational systems. Statisticians in the central department are not involved in their production and, as such, these statistics are not directly overseen by the DfT head of profession.

## Data published

A timetable of operational practical statistics the DSA is publishing will be available by the end of August 2012. It will be published on this page. 

## Practical test statistics

The DSA started publishing practical test statistics in August 2010. All statistics give data from the 2007/08 financial year onwards.

## Information you cannot find

If you cannot find the information you need, it may have been:

  * published in response to an FOI request 
  * designated as an official statistic 

You can [send an FOI request](https://www.dft.gov.uk/foi/form/) if you still cannot find the information you need.

## Information that cannot be released

The DSA cannot send you information if it is part of an official statistic that has not yet been published. This is because the [Pre-release Access to Official Statistics Order 2008](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2008/2998/contents/made) limits access to official statistics until they are published.

## Door to door Journey Planner

![Image: door to door icon](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110206082507/http://www.dft.gov.uk/144130/246087/doortodoor)

The core feature of the Transport Direct Portal is the Door-to-door journey planner. A world first, this plans journeys from door to door using all feasible means of public transport anywhere in Great Britain; at the same time it can plan the journey by car, allowing the user to compare car and public transport journey options (Figure 5).

**Figure 5: Comparing Public Transport and Car Journeys**

![Figure 5: Comparing Public Transport and Car Journeys](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110206082507/http://www.dft.gov.uk/144130/246087/fig5a.jpg)

![Figure 5: Comparing Public Transport and Car Journeys](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110206082507/http://www.dft.gov.uk/144130/246087/fig5b.jpg)

Once the journeys have been planned:

  * The costs of the journey options can be provided as can the CO2 emissions;
  * Tickets can be purchased from online retailers (through an automated hand-off) or telephone numbers provided for telephone-based retailers;
  * The route, or individual sections of it, can be displayed on a map;
  * Calling points for a service can be displayed;
  * All information can be printed in order to provide an informative itinerary to take on the journey.

When **connecting people to places**, it is important that users can find their journey origin and destination from appropriate gazetteers or directly from the map. Transport Direct has created a rich set of gazetteers, based on postcodes, addresses, transport locations, places and even local attractions.

  * [Single mode Journey Planners](http://www.transportdirect.info/Web2/JourneyPlanning/JourneyPlannerInput.aspx)

![Image: single mode journey planners icon](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110206082507/http://www.dft.gov.uk/144130/246087/singlejourney)

In many cases, the traveller may only want to find out about part of a journey or travelling options using specific modes. Consequently, Transport Direct provides a range of modal journey planners:

  * Find a train;
  * Find a flight;
  * Find a car route;
  * Find a coach;
  * Find a bus;
  * Find a cycle route.

## Live travel information

![Image: live travel news icon](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110206082507/http://www.dft.gov.uk/144130/246087/livetravelnews)

Underpinning Transport Direct is comprehensive provision of live travel information, sourced from authoritative sources and recognised intermediaries.

The live travel news is updated every 15 minutes and can be filtered by:

  * Region / all of Great Britain;
  * Public transport / road / all types of transport;
  * Major / recent / all delays;
  * Incidents / road & rail engineering works / all types of travel news;
  * All road or public transport incidents can also be displayed on a map for geographic referencing.

Transport Direct also provides links to up-to-the-minute arrival and departure information for rail, bus services (where provided) and flights from the definitive sources such as National Rail, Transport for London, bus service information providers and airport operators.

## Car Parking and Park-and-Ride information

![Image: park and ride icon](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110206082507/http://www.dft.gov.uk/144130/246087/carparking)

  * [**Car Parking and Park-and-Ride information on Transport Direct**](http://www.transportdirect.info/Web2/LiveTravel/DepartureBoards.aspx?NotFindAMode=true)

Planning a car journey from door to door is straightforward when there is readily available on-road or off-road car parking. However, this is not always the case. Much more useful would be to plan to the nearest car park (within walking distance of the destination) or to a park-and-ride service and complete the journey by public transport.

Transport Direct has car park information for over 10,000 car parks, covering major towns and cities across Great Britain, and the range is being constantly expanded.

Using the ""find nearest car park"" service, the user can now find the nearest car park to their destination and also get information on costs and opening times. Car Parks are also shown on Transport Direct's maps, enabling journeys to be planned to and from these locations.

Transport Direct also has park-and-ride information for many cities, with details on cost and opening hours. The ""plan to park and ride"" service plans car journeys to and from the best park-and-ride location for the direction of travel to that city.

## Calculating Carbon Emissions

![Image: carbon calculator screen shot](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110206082507/http://www.dft.gov.uk/144130/246087/carboncalculator)

  * [Calculating Carbon Emissions on Transport Direct](http://www.transportdirect.info/Web2/JourneyPlanning/FindCarParkInput.aspx)

Transport Direct launched a car ""carbon calculator"" at the end of 2006, which is believed to be another world first. This feature enables the user to calculate the amount of CO2 emitted for a specific journey planned on Transport Direct, taking account of predicted levels of congestion on the roads and so enabling greater accuracy in the calculation of the emitted CO2.

In April 2007, Transport Direct launched an equivalent public transport carbon calculator. This enables users to find out how much CO2 is emitted from their specific public transport journey and compares this with car and other modes of transport.

It should be noted that comparing car CO2 with public transport CO2 is not comparing like for like, where the predicted CO2 emission for a:

  * Car journey is based on a specified number of occupants;
  * Public transport journey is based on an estimate of the number of passengers.

## What's New

Transport Direct recently developed the London 2012 Olympic Spectator Journey Planner which was based on the original Transport Direct back office.

Support from this bid round is estimated to remove over 800,000 lorry journeys from the roads of Great Britain between November 2011 and March 2014. 
    1. It should be noted that the awards listed in the table are provisional maxima. In some cases, the award may not lead to a contract; in others, the amount agreed in a subsequent contract may be lower than the accepted bid. Furthermore there is no guarantee that traffic contracted in any round will continue to operate.
    2. The traffic moved under each MSRS contract is closely monitored. Where traffic levels have been lower than those in the grantees' contracts, reductions to the contract have been made. This process ensures the effective control of the budget and maximizes the amount of benefit that can be purchased through the scheme.
    3. The Department for Transport is currently running two schemes that facilitate the purchase of the environmental and social benefits that result from using rail or water transport instead of road. These are: 
      * Mode Shift Revenue Support (MSRS) scheme: assists companies with the operating costs associated with running rail and inland waterway freight transport instead of road (where rail/ inland waterways are more expensive than road).
      * Waterborne Freight Grant scheme (WFG): assists companies with the operating costs, for up to three years, associated with running coastal and short sea shipping freight transport instead of road (where short sea/ coastal shipping is more expensive than road).
    4. Applications for the Department's freight grant schemes are prioritised in a bid round process. Further details on bid rounds are available on the Department's website. Guidance and application [forms are available on the Business Link website](http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.s=b&r.l4=1084729126&r.l1=1081597476&r.lc=en&r.l3=1084756086&r.l2=1082103262&topicId=1084756086)

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/high-speed-rail-addendum,45,"## Summary

On 10 January 2012 the Government announced its decision to develop a new national high speed rail network following the completion of a major public consultation. On 29 May, the consultation responses were published online. We then discovered that a small number of responses (407 out of 55,322 responses) had unintentionally not been forwarded to Dialogue by Design for inclusion in their response assessment process. In addition, a further 6 responses had been incorrectly marked as duplicates by Dialogue by Design.

This addendum report is a supplementary analysis of all the affected consultation responses which was commissioned from Dialogue by Design. The report concludes that these 413 responses do not provide any information that was not already included in the previous Consultation Summary Report or would have made a difference to the substantive content or balance of that report"". Therefore, their inclusion in Dialogue by Design's original review of responses would not have substantially changed its findings nor affected the considerations which informed the decisions following consultation.

The Secretary of State for Transport issued a statement to Parliament about this on 17 July 2012 and we have contacted all those who submitted a response affected by the processing error. The consultation summary report and the addendum report each include a list of participating organisations at appendix 2 and appendix 1 respectively. Individual respondents are not listed.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/hs2-consultation-summary,46,"## Executive summary

This report provides a summary of the responses to the Government's consultation on _High speed rail: Investing in Britain's future_.

The Government believes investing in a national high speed rail network is the best value for money solution for enhancing rail capacity and performance in the United Kingdom. It launched a consultation on the proposed high speed rail strategy and its proposed route for an initial high speed line from London to the West Midlands. The consultation ran for five months, closing on 29 July 2011.

The Government received 54,909 responses to this consultation. About 40% of the responses were submitted through the consultation website; the remaining 60% included paper response forms, individual letters and emails, detailed reports and organised responses. Close to 15,000 responses were identified as part of organised submissions. A response is considered part of an organised submission if its content is identical or nearly identical to numerous other responses, e.g. consisting of a pre-printed response postcard to which respondents add their details.

Members of the public submitted the great majority of responses. Organisations which responded included statutory agencies, local authorities, businesses and various representative groups. Responses came from regions across the UK, with concentrations in postcode areas in proximity to the proposed route from London to the West Midlands.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/intelligent-links,49,"You can use intelligent links on your website to give directions to any number of destinations of your choosing. Intelligent links open Transport Direct's journey planning input page with your destination pre-set, like this: [Get directions](http://www.transportdirect.info/transportdirect/en/journeyplanning/jplandingpage.aspx?&id=bgsite&d=402136,286474&dn=Little%20Nibble%20Cafe)

Here are two examples:

  * [Corfe Castle: How to get here (below map, under 'Plan your visit')](http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/corfe-castle/how-to-get-here/%20)
  * [Lower Red Lion, St Albans (click Transport Direct logo in 'How to get there' section)](http://fancyapint.com/pubs/pub3577.html)

Creating an intelligent link is easy. If you have several destinations and want to create a link for each one, download this [Excel link generator](http://assets.dft.gov.uk/publications/intelligent-links/intelligentlink.xls), which automates the process.

For just one link, use the following template link and follow the two steps described below: http://www.transportdirect.info/web2/journeyplanning/jpLandingPage.aspx?&id=bg2012&d= 526594,179632&dn=Royal+Albert+Hall

  * Change 526594,179632 to the X,Y co-ordinates of your destination (you can convert a postcode into co-ordinates with websites such as [Streetmap](http://www.streetmap.co.uk/))
  * Change Royal+Albert+Hall to the name of your destination. You can also change the text ""Get directions"" to anything you like, if you wish.

In HTML, the link would look something like this:

<a href=""http://www.transportdirect.info/web2/journeyplanning/jpLandingPage.aspx?&id=bg2012&d=526594,179632&dn=Royal+Albert+Hall"" target=_blank&rt;Get directions</a> (The target=_blank command will make Transport Direct open in a new browser window, so that your visitor doesn't 'lose' the page they were looking at).

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/key-metrics-and-statistics,52,"Transport Direct's usage continues to grow steadily month on month. The pie chart below shows user session figures for August 2012. Since its launch in December 2004, Transport Direct has achieved over 110 million user sessions.

![Transport Direct pie chart](http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/files/2012/09/transport-direct-pie-chart.jpg)

The [Transport Direct Portal](http://www.transportdirect.info) provides a one-stop-shop for users to make intelligent travel choices based on its rich set of travel and transport information and services. Part of connecting people to places (Transport Direct's strapline) is to provide information on those places. This gives context to the journey by providing, for example, a map showing the location of a bus stop or a list of the nearest car parks to the destination. Location information and travel news both help the user to make intelligent travel choices and, as such, make better use of the transport infrastructure.

Transport Direct achieves an average of:

  * 378,000 user sessions per week
  * 2,000,000 pages per week
  * 12,500 mobile pages per week
  * 5,300 mobile user sessions per week
  * 10,100 Digital TV Web pages per week
  * 830 Digital TV User sessions per week

A set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were set out in Transport Direct's original business plan in order to assess the effectiveness of Transport Direct, including:

  * Initial achievement of one million unique visitor sessions in the first year of operation to confirm visibility and usage. This was achieved in June 2005, six months after launch.
  * A goal of ten million unique visitor sessions by 2006 to establish Transport Direct as a major source of travel and transport information. This was achieved on 1st December 2006.

Transport Direct developed the Spectator Journey Planner for the 2012 Olympics and final usage was just short of 4 million sessions with almost 2.75 million unique users.

## Traffic signs review

Red tape will be tackled and costs for councils reduced following [the biggest review into Britain's traffic signing system for 40 years](/news/press-releases/dft-press-20111013a). Rules would be relaxed to dramatically reduce the number of signs councils need to use, while red tape will be cut to allow councils to put in place frequently used signs without needing to get Government's permission every time. Councils could publicise traffic regulation orders in a manner that is appropriate for the target audience rather than forcing them to pay for newspaper as is currently the case.

## Growing Places Fund

A Prospectus on the Government's [£500m Growing Places Fund](http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2024671) has been published, setting out how the Fund will operate and inviting proposals from Local Enterprise Partnerships. The Fund has been established to support local infrastructure projects which unlock housing and economic growth.

## Highways Maintenance Efficiency Programme

In June HMEP wrote to all CEOs seeking their views about the programme and a summary of their responses and the next steps has now been published. HMEP also issued a survey to get a better understanding of the sector and the initial results are available.

The Government announced its decisions on the Development Pool of local major transport schemes on 29 November and 14 December 2011. We are today publishing an update document setting out the process in more detail. For the 41 schemes where decisions have been announced, we are publishing the Department's internal assessment of the bids using the 5 elements of the Transport Business Case and the individual funding offer letters for each scheme. Some information has been redacted where it might prejudice ongoing financial considerations.

On 21 March 2012 the Government announced its decision on the bid received for the Bexhill to Hastings Link Road. The Department's assessment of the bid and funding offer letter are now included in the list of supporting documentation below.

On 10 May the Department notified Rotherham MBC that DfT would not provide funding for the Waverley Link Road scheme. The Department's decision letter is included in the list below.

On 11 October the Department notified Essex County Council (and its partners, Thurrock and Southend Councils) that DfT would not provide funding for the South Essex Rapid Transit scheme. The Department's decision letter is included in the list below.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/local-sustainable-transport-fund-guidance-on-the-application-process,58,"The Local Transport White Paper Creating Growth, Cutting Carbon, published in January 2011, placed localism at the heart of the transport agenda in order to cut carbon emissions and create local growth. A total of £560 million was originally made available through the Local Sustainable Transport Fund to enable the Department to fund a number of high quality bids. Funding was topped up with a further £40 million to £600 million in 2012 to accommodate approval for a greater number of bids (with match funding being provided by local authority partners). In total, DfT awarded funding to 96 packages to 77 authorities to deliver their schemes between 2011 and 2015. Along with local contributions provided by all funded project teams, over £1 billion is now being invested in local sustainable travel.

The funding announcements made were as follows:

  * 11 September 2012, Ministers approved just under £5 million to Tyne and Wear ITA for a small project, based on the strongest elements of their Large Project proposal (which was turned down for funding in June 2012)
  * 27 June 2012, Ministers awarded £225 million to 12 large projects (above £5 million), plus £41 million to 14 tranche 2 projects (small projects up to £5 million)
  * 24 May 2012, Ministers awarded £113 million to 30 tranche 2 projects (small projects up to £5 million)
  * 5 July 2011, Ministers awarded £155 million to 39 tranche 1 projects (small projects up to £5 million)

The Local Sustainable Transport Fund bidding rounds are now closed and the fund is fully committed.

## Transcript

Good morning and thank you for taking the time to attend today's workshop on the Local Sustainable Transport Fund. I'm sorry I'm not here in person, but as the first Transport Minister to have specific responsibility for alternatives to travel, it's perhaps appropriate for me to take advantage of video technology to make a virtual appearance at each of these events.

Last month I was delighted to announce our new [Local Transport White Paper, Creating Growth Cutting Carbon](/publications/making-sustainable-local-transport-happen/). An unprecedented £560m has been allocated to local authorities through our new Local Sustainable Transport Fund to support this.

The White Paper forms part of our overall strategy to tackle carbon emissions from transport.

The Government is convinced that in the longer term, progressive electrification of the passenger car fleet will play an important role in decarbonising transport. We also need to reduce the carbon impact of longer journeys - and high speed rail between some of our largest cities has a critical role to play. By prioritising spending on key rail projects such as [high speed rail](/topics/high-speed-rail/) and [Crossrail](/topics/crossrail/), we will be providing commuters and intercity travellers with attractive new options instead of the car.

But the White Paper sets out the tools that are available to us now to provide that early reduction in carbon emissions that local action is best placed to deliver. Those tools are sustainable travel measures. [Sustainable travel](/topics/sustainable/) is important because it not only reduces carbon, but also tackles congestion and brings additional health and environmental benefits.

And these measures - as demonstrated by the Sustainable Travel Towns, and the Cycling Demonstration Towns - have proven, economic evaluations which show that they are high value for money.

This is why the White Paper focuses on encouraging and enabling people to make sustainable travel choices for local trips. These represent the biggest opportunity for sustainable travel options such as walking, cycling or public transport, because around 2 out of 3 of every trips we make are less than 5 miles.

Research also shows that improvements to sustainable travel can increase turnover in the high street by five to 15 per cent. because people who travel to the shops on foot, by bicycle or public transport perhaps surprisingly tend to spend more per head than those who travel by car. It also helps tackle congestion, which cause delays in urban areas at a cost of around £11 billion per annum.

And let's not forget there are further benefits - investment in sustainable transport helps make our towns and cities healthier and more attractive places to live, work and shop. Currently, for example, the costs to society of physical inactivity, poor air quality are up to £25 billion per year.

Of course, the most sustainable mode of transport is not travelling at all. Although I'm the first ever Transport Minister to have official responsibilities for alternatives to travel, my mission isn't to stop people travelling. But I'd certainly like everyone to give greater consideration to whether their journeys are necessary in the first place.

Measures such as encouraging home working:

  * staggering people's working days so roads and trains are less congested at peak times;
  * promoting the use of high-speed broadband for both business and leisure purposes
  * and encouraging the uptake of video conferencing as an alternative to long-distance travel
  * all play a part in achieving travel reductions and subsequently contribute towards greater business efficiency and reducing business costs. I would encourage you to think about how such measures can be incorporated into your bids.

The White paper is deliberately not prescriptive, but provides practical guidance with examples of ways in which local authorities can and are dealing with the transport issues in their areas.

This reflects our commitment to end the top down decision making and the tendency in Whitehall to develop 'one size fits all solutions', which ignore the specific needs and behaviour patterns of local communities.

The Government has already taken significant steps to hand back power to local communities. These include decentralising economic power through the Regional Growth Fund, the new Local Enterprise Partnerships; decentralising land use planning through the new Planning Policy Frameworks; and increasing transparency and accountability. 

And the Local Sustainable Transport Fund forms part of a wider picture of more streamlined and simplified funding to local authorities. Transport funding streams have been radically simplified - down from 26 to just four. The Fund also represents a move away from specific grants, so providing you with the freedom to develop your own targeted transport packages that address the particular transport problems in your area.

We're particularly keen to receive bids for the Local Sustainable Transport Fund from local authorities who are in partnership with the voluntary, community and social enterprise sector, as well as having the support of local businesses. I believe that by encouraging bids in this way, we will be able to capture innovative solutions to local transport needs in both rural and urban areas.

An example I often quote is the Cuckmere Community Bus in my own constituency. Individual residents in the Cuckmere Valley have come together to run regular and frequent bus services, taking people in rural areas to their nearest towns. These services are provided entirely by volunteers.

'Wheels to Work' schemes provide transport to people who are unable to access training, employment or education, due to a lack of suitable public or private transport. They particularly benefit people living in isolated rural communities and can play an important part in helping others to come off benefits and regain their independence.

These are real examples, happening right now, and in today's poster presentations you will be hearing about other successful sustainable travel initiatives that have been delivered. We want to enable similar stories to unfold in many more places across the country. The design and scope of the packages you submit are entirely up to you, so long as you can demonstrate a clear fit with the Government's new vision for sustainable travel. And I have been keen to offer a flexible bidding process - reflecting not only the complexity and scale of bids, but also the state of readiness of proposals. The Department's assessment of bids will also be proportionate to the value of bids that are submitted.

This new vision for local transport - creating growth and cutting carbon through small scale sustainable transport packages, is being rolled out against a backdrop of nation-wide initiatives with the same objectives. The investment we've committed to sustainable transport further underlines our determination to secure growth while cutting carbon.

For example, over £400 million has been earmarked to promote the uptake of ultra low carbon vehicle technologies.

Progressive electrification of rail routes is also on the agenda.

And the Green Bus Fund will help fund around 500 new hybrid and electric buses, playing a vital role in unlocking potential and stimulating a growing market.

With operators and public sector bodies, we're also delivering the infrastructure to enable most local public transport journeys to be undertaken using smart ticketing by December 2014.

Finally, we're reviewing the way in which transport investment decisions are made to ensure that the carbon implications are fully recognised.

To sum up, the Government wishes to support as many authorities and their partners as possible through the Fund. The Local Transport White Paper sets out the vision and through the Fund we've provided you with the resources to take it forward. The rest is up to you. I hope you find today's workshop helpful in putting your bids together and I very much look forward to receiving the first round of applications in April.

Thank you.

Shared space is a design approach that seeks to change the way streets operate by reducing the dominance of motor vehicles, primarily through lower speeds and encouraging drivers to behave more accommodatingly towards pedestrians.  
In the UK, shared space is usually applied to links and minor junctions with the aim of allowing pedestrians to move more freely within the space. This Local Transport Note (LTN) focuses on High Street environments, but many of its principles will apply to other types of shared space.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/making-smarter-choices-work,63,"'Making smarter choices work' is a promotional guide to explain what Smart Choice measures are, what they can achieve and how they can be used effectively to reduce the impacts of congestion.

We call these measures 'smarter choices' and they are becoming an increasingly important area for the Department for Transport. Smarter choices include local programmes to encourage school, workplace and individualised travel planning; improving public transport information and marketing services; setting up web sites for car share schemes and supporting car clubs; and encouraging teleworking and teleconferencing.

This guide has been written for local authorities ? both members and officers ? and explains what we know about smarter choice measures, based on the latest research. It explains how local authorities can use them to improve traffic flows and make life more pleasant for local people. The research on which this document is based was carried out during 2003-04 and looked at the impact that these measures can have on traffic. The final report, 'Smarter Choices ? Changing the Way We Travel'was published in July this year in parallel with the Department's White Paper 'The Future of Transport'. It provides firm evidence of the impact of smarter choices on traffic, particularly where local authorities have promoted them vigorously.

The challenge now for local authorities is to recognise the potential benefits of smarter choice measures so that they make them an integral part of their transport strategies. Not only can they reduce congestion, but they give people genuine travel choices. They also contribute cost-effectively to other Government priorities, such as improving accessibility and social inclusion, encouraging regeneration, reducing pollution and carbon emissions and helping to increase levels of physical activity.

Smarter choices are techniques for influencing people's travel behaviour towards more sustainable options such as encouraging school, workplace and individualised travel planning. They also seek to improve public transport and marketing services such as travel awareness campaigns, setting up websites for car share schemes, supporting car clubs and encouraging teleworking.

## Travel plans

A travel plan is a package of measures produced by schools or employers to encourage parents or staff to use alternatives to single-occupancy car-use. Such a plan for example, could include: car sharing schemes; a commitment to improve cycling facilities; a dedicated bus service or restricted car parking allocations. It might also promote flexible-working practices such as remote access and video conferencing.

Travel plans can offer real benefits not only to organisations, pupils and/or employees, but also the community that surrounds it. They may help relieve local parking or congestion problems or improve public transport connections across the area. They may also relieve stress by reducing delays, or providing the opportunity for staff to cut their travel commitments by working from home on occasion.

## Transcript

**Narrator:** Minister for Shipping Mike Penning undertook a fact-finding visit to the Maritime and Coastguard Agency's Solent Rescue and Co-ordination Centre. Britain's Coastguard Service is kept very busy, as Chief Coastguard Rod Johnson explains.

**Rod Johnson, Chief Coastguard:** Her Majesty's Coastguard has an operating area which encompasses all 10,500 miles of the coast of the UK and about a million square miles of ocean - we go from nearly to the Arctic Circle out to mid-Atlantic and then down into much warmer waters. We deal with about 20,000 incidents a year and we're based at 19 sites that look pretty much like this one.  We deal with absolutely everything from sinking ships, fires and oil spills to lost children and dogs that get out of their depth - we deal with everything.

**Mike Penning, Minister for Shipping:** Well it's massively important and for people that live on the coast they do think of them with the other three emergency services. Their role, whether it be cliff rescues or sea rescues, or actually moving inland as well these days, is vitally important. That' what I was telling the people here today - how much we appreciate the service they do to the community.

**RJ:** This station' open 24 hours a day. We're in touch with a mariner; if they alert us to a distress then we will plot the position of that, devise a plan and allocate search units to it - they could be lifeboats from the RNLI, our own helicopter or our own brigade of Coastguard Rescue Officers. So the helicopter you've seen today is an Augusta Westland 139. It's equipped to deal with the kind of rapid fire incidents that we get down here.  It's very quick - 165 knots in still air - it can take up to eight people, has a dedicated crew of four and it's fitted with the last word in sensors and avionics. So it's a very capable, very modern machine.

**MP:** And this was a fantastic helicopter. I mean, the stability in the air, you can tell how safe it was. Now all helicopters, they tell me, are safe but when you fly in them you know the difference, and actually this was a fantastic helicopter and a great crew.

**RJ:** We are very highly regarded on the world stage. We operate at a very high standard. I'm constantly being asked to facilitate training opportunities from other countries. Our procedures have been adopted lock, stock and barrel by other countries. So we are a world leader at this.

**MP:** Their dedication is fantastic.  We should be very proud of them.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/mobile-phone-and-digital-tv,67,"## Transport Direct Mobile Phone

On a PDA or mobile phone using the latest browser technology (WAP2.0) over a GPRS or a 3G connection you can get scheduled arrival and departure times and in some cases provide the expected arrival or departure times for rail stations.

These stations can be clicked to show 'Station information' where phone numbers for taxi and/or cab (private hire car) firms serving the station are listed.

You can also connect to 'Travel news' link, which will list both current incidents and planned events that can affect or delay journeys, such as traffic accidents, road works, etc. You can tailor the information so that it is of interest to you by selecting options from the drop-down lists.

You can learn how to use these services on a PDA by using the PDA simulator which can be found on the [Tips and tools](http://www.transportdirect.info/Web2/Tools/Home.aspx) page of the Transport Direct website.

### Journey Planner

In July 2010 Directgov mobile launched a new door-to-door journey planner, in collaboration with Transport Direct. The new mobile service enables users to plan full, door-to-door journeys using a range of public transport including trains, buses and tube as well as by foot.

Users will choose their 'to' and 'from' destinations, and an arrival time, to receive a step-by-step guide with detailed breakdowns for each stage of the journey. The planner also provides Google maps for any parts that involve walking.  
The service is available on every internet-enabled mobile phone, so you can use it anytime, anywhere to help you find where you're going.

To use the journey planner, go to m.direct.gov.uk/journey in your phone's internet browser, or text JOURNEY to 83377 and you'll be sent the link by text message (all texts are free).

## Transport Direct Digital Interactive TV

Transport Direct is also available via digital interactive TV, cable and Freeview boxes with a modem or broadband connection. Using your remote control you can access up to the minute bus and train timetables as well as the latest traffic and transport news from the comfort of your sofa.

To find out how to access the service, please visit the [Tips and Tools](http://www.transportdirect.info/Web2/Tools/Home.aspx) section of the portal.

## Transcript

Hello, and thank you for inviting me to speak to you this evening.

While it would be good to meet you all in person, a virtual appearance allows me to demonstrate what I like to call the fifth mode of transport. As well as rail, air, sea and roads, we also have a further option - alternatives to travel.

So while it might appear as though I am about to launch into, ""Good evening Azerbaijan - Here are the votes of the UK jury"", this is actually me demonstrating my commitment to an important aspect of my Ministerial brief!

You are gathered this evening in the impressive setting of the National Railway Museum, which preserves the best of our rail heritage.

It's always tempting, surrounded by the physical reminders of past rail innovation and talent, to reminisce about a golden age of railways in this country. Defining just when that golden age began and ended is of course half the fun.

But I have a different proposition for you. The golden age of Britain's railways is right now. After years of decline, the Government is pressing ahead with an ambitious set of rail projects that is bigger in scale than anything attempted here for over a hundred years.

Because the case for rail investment is overwhelming. We've seen massive growth in passenger numbers over the last 15 years. Even the economic traumas of the last four years have scarcely put a break on the ever rising popularity of rail travel both passenger and freight. 

So, notwithstanding the overriding need to press ahead with tackling the deficit that has been reduced by 25 billion over the last two years, the Government is determined not to repeat the mistake made in so many previous downturns. That of putting on ice the rail investment that can actually enable the economy to grow.

Obviously there have been some very difficult decisions on issues such as VAT and welfare reform, but we've been able to commit £18 billion to rail in this spending review period.

So as well as our plans for transformational high speed rail, we're delivering the Thameslink programme; electrification of key routes in the north of England and on the Great Western line; massive redevelopment of stations like Birmingham New Street and Reading; and the first elements of the Northern Hub project. 

That's in addition to around 2,700 new carriages, including the Intercity Express Programme.

And significant improvements to the light rail networks in Birmingham, Manchester, Nottingham and Newcastle, plus my announcement earlier this month of the Tram Train pilot between Sheffield and Rotherham. Not forgetting the long awaited upgrade of the London Underground. 

What's more, nearly a quarter of a century after it was first mooted, Crossrail construction is now well underway.

Crossrail is the biggest construction project in Europe and tunnelling under central London began earlier this month. Crossrail provides a vitally needed uplift to the capital's public transport system and a crucial new link to our nation's busiest and most important airport.

As well as improving life for passengers, all of this adds up to a period of historic opportunity for the rail industry and those who supply it.

But investment alone cannot prepare our railway for the future.

We learnt from the last government that simply spending more and more on public services is no guarantee of success.

Investment must be accompanied by change and reform, with a clear focus on improving the passenger experience and reducing costs.

It is only through reform that we can respond to understandable passenger concerns on fares.

If the rail industry is to earn the 'right to grow' highlighted in Sir Roy McNulty's report on value for money, it is essential that costs come down.

There's already some progress.

Network Rail is due to deliver £1.2 billion of efficiency savings by 2014 with at least a further £600 million expected by 2019.

But more needs to be done.

By 2019, we want the industry to close the full £3.5 billion efficiency gap identified in the McNulty report.

It's clear that none of us can deliver the change we need in isolation.

All too often in the past, governments have either imposed their own plans for reform on the railway, or simply set targets for the industry to achieve without giving them the means to do so.

In contrast, we have sought to build a consensus for change using a collaborative approach. Because we believe that working effectively together is essential if we are to achieve the modern, affordable, efficiently-run rail network that our country needs.

I am persuaded that the rail industry can have it all. 

Tackling costs while continuing to grow. 

Deliver high profile projects while moving passengers and freight across the network in unprecedented numbers, every day. 

Cutting carbon and creating growth. So tonight look around and remember with a fondness a golden past but also celebrate the golden present as well.

When Jimmy Saville said it, it wasn't true. But it is now. This is the age of the train.

Thank you and I hope you enjoy the rest of the evening.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/plug-in-van-grant,72,"Since February 2012, motorists purchasing a qualifying ultra-low emission van can receive a grant of 20 per cent towards the cost of the vehicle, up to a maximum of £8,000.

The Government is adopting a 'technology neutral' approach to reducing emissions from transport. This means that any completed van (chassis and bodywork) which meets the criteria below will be eligible for the subsidy.

The Plug-in Van Grant has been designed to help make the whole-life costs of a qualifying van more comparable with petrol or diesel equivalents. Over time, as manufacturers begin to make these vans in greater volumes, the costs of production should begin to fall. This will help to make an ultra-low carbon van a realistic option for anyone looking to buy or lease a van.

Both private consumers and businesses can benefit from the Plug-in Van Grant when purchasing a qualifying ultra-low emission van and registering it in the UK.

The vans eligible for the Plug-in Car Grant are:

[Smith Electric Smith Edison](http://smithelectric.com/smith-vehicles/models-and-configurations/)

As of 30 September 2012, 140 claims have been made through the Plug-in Van Grant scheme.

## Van eligibility

To qualify, the vehicle must be within the N1 category, as defined under EU Directive (EC) 2007/46/EC, with a gross weight of 3.5 tonnes or less.

To be eligible for the grant applicants need to demonstrate that their completed vehicle (chassis and bodywork) has type approval, meets minimum EC regulatory standards for volume production and meets the Grant criteria.

### Multi-stage builds

For the purposes of the Plug-In Van Grant any multi-stage built N1 vehicle will need to have been approved as a completed vehicle (e.g. comprising both chassis and bodywork): the Accepted evidence listed above must cover the vehicle in its finished condition. An approval for a vehicle that has not been completed will not be accepted. This is to ensure vehicles driven off the forecourt when bought by the public meet the Plug-In Van Grant criteria.

Manufacturers will need to consult the Vehicle Certification Agency (VCA) to obtain completed vehicle approval

  * [Type approval for goods vehicles](http://www.dft.gov.uk/vca/vehicletype/type-approval-for-go.asp)
  * [European Community whole vehicle type approval (ECWVTA)](http://www.dft.gov.uk/vca/vehicletype/ecwvta-framework-directive.asp)

Eligibility criteria for the Plug-In Van Grant

Criteria type Explanation

Vehicle type
Only new vans are eligible (vehicle category 'N1′ with a gross weight of 3.5 tonnes or less). This includes pre-registration conversions (normal, internal combustion engine vans that were converted to battery or hybrid versions by specialist convertors before the van's first registration).

Carbon dioxide exhaust emissions
Vehicles must emit less than 75 grams of carbon dioxide (CO2) per kilometre driven.

Range
Eligible fully electric vans must be able to travel a minimum of 60 miles between charges. Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) must have a minimum electric range of 10 miles.

Minimum top speed
Vehicles must be able to reach a speed of 50 miles per hour or more.

Warranty
Vehicles must have: 

  * a 3-year or 60,000-miles vehicle warranty (guarantee)
  * a 3-year battery and electric drive train warranty, with the option of extending the battery warranty for an extra 2 years

'Drive train' means the parts that send power from the engine to the wheels. These include the clutch, transmission (gear box), drive shafts, U-joints and differential 

Battery performance
Vehicles must have: 

  * either a minimum 5-year warranty on the battery and electric drive train as standard
  * or extra evidence of battery performance to show reasonable performance after 3 years of use

Electrical safety
Vehicles must comply with certain regulations (UN-ECE Reg 100.00) that show that they are electrically safe.

Crash safety
To make sure vans will be safe in a crash, they must either have: 

  * Minimum EC regulatory standards for volume production; 
  * Or evidence that the van demonstrates high levels of safety as judged by international standards. For example, crash testing for other internationally recognised consumer information programmes or regulatory standards, that offer a comparable level of safety stringency as EC minimum regulatory standards for volume production.

## Frequently asked questions

### 1. I am thinking about buying a qualifying van - how do I apply for the Grant?

If you are looking to use the Plug-in Van Grant to purchase an eligible van, the good news is that there are no application forms to fill in. The dealership or vendor you are buying your van from will complete all the paperwork on your behalf as you buy the van; and the amount of your rant will be automatically deducted from the price of your van at the point of purchase.

Before you purchase your van, the dealer will ask you a few questions about your decision to purchase an ultra-low emission vehicle. This data will help inform policy decisions about ultra-low emission vehicles and supporting infrastructure.

### 2. I am a vehicle manufacturer looking to see whether a model is eligible for subsidy under the terms of the scheme. How do I apply for Plug-in Van Grant eligibility?

Vehicle manufacturers who want to apply for their vehicle model to be eligible for subsidy under the scheme will need to make a formal application. To do this, you will require an application pack and associated guidance. You can request this from [olev.enquiries@olev.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:olev.enquiries@olev.gsi.gov.uk)

### 3. I am a vehicle importer looking to import and sell eligible vehicles in the UK.  How do I apply for Plug-in Car Grant eligibility?

Importers also need to demonstrate the vehicles they will import and sell meet the Grant criteria. To do this, you will require an application pack and associated guidance. You can request this from [olev.enquiries@olev.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:olev.enquiries@olev.gsi.gov.uk). For example, you will need to submit information on the measures you have taken to mitigate electrical safety risks and the warranty that you will provide with the vehicles that you intend to sell.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/rail-industry-research-strategy-implementation-plan,74,"## Executive summary

The Rail Industry Research Strategy (RIRS) was published in December 2007. It established a set of strategic priorities for rail research aimed at supporting the delivery of the rail industry's long-term vision for the railway as expressed in the Rail Technical Strategy and Rail White Paper. The RIRS also considered how rail-related research is managed, delivered and funded. A set of 'Enabling Actions' was proposed for development to support the implementation of the strategy.

This Implementation Plan sets out each of these Enabling Actions, focusing on short-term activities and plans for 2008/09. The Enabling Actions tackle three main areas:

  * Strategic research - to encourage a step-change in the delivery of strategic research, focused on meeting the long-term challenges of the railway as set out in the Rail Technical Strategy. This is a priority of the RIRS. The relevant Enabling Actions are: 
    * Establishing a client group for strategic research
    * Developing a framework for strategic research
    * A new strategic research programme
    * Developing route maps to the railway of the future
  * Collaboration - to ensure that best use is made of existing funding by leveraging in additional resources from the private sector, from Europe and from other non-rail public sector sources. The Enabling Actions comprise: 
    * Developing an additional co-funding mechanism for RSSB research to encourage partnership with the private sector
    * Collaborative working with Research Councils and other research funders
    * Engaging effectively in European research
  * Delivery mechanisms - to identify, promote and adopt best practice in the delivery of research. The Enabling Actions are: 
    * Improving the transition from research to technology development
    * Knowledge management to capture and make use of the results of research
    * Technology transfer from other industries or other countries
    * Estimating benefits at proposal stage
    * Evaluating the impacts of completed rail research

Each of these Enabling Actions has an identified owner, agreed long-term aims and short-term objectives.

Finally, the Implementation Plan also sets out how resource requirements for rail research can be evaluated. In the short-term, priority actions are aimed at achieving better value for money from the resources currently available and providing incremental increases where this can be justified. In the medium term, an approach which seeks to establish the level of research funding needed in its totality is more appropriate. These initiatives will be progressed in parallel with the 12 Enabling Actions.

## Transcript

**Voice over:**Life is about to get easier for road users, businesses, and local authorities. Roads Minister Mike Penning has pledged to slash unnecessary red tape, as part of the Government's Red Tape Challenge. The Challenge which extends across government, was launched by the Prime Minister on 7th April

**David Cameron:** One of the key aims of this coalition is to massively reduce the number of laws and regulations that frankly treat all of you like idiots. / There are 21,000 statutory rules and regulations in force in our country and I want us to bring that number and overall burden of regulation down and fast.

**V/O:** And it's time for you to have your say on over 400 Whitehall road transport regulations that have been placed on the Red Tape Challenge website. Tell us what regulations you think are well designed and provide vital protections - and which ones you think are badly designed, badly implemented or simply a bad idea.

Experienced 'sector champions' are not only providing expert knowledge during the Red Tape Challenge, but are also encouraging everyone to participate. A person speaking for millions of ordinary motorists is Edmund King, President of the AA.

**Edmund King, AA:** Road transport is vital to almost everybody. We all use road transport, whether we're pedestrians, cyclists, motor bike riders, car drivers, truckers. When they look at things like parking, they often think there are far too many restrictions, whether it's a fact that if you've got a 'pay and display' ticket that you've paid for, you can't pass it on to another motorist even though there's an hour left, or why don't some machines… don't give change when you haven't got the right change? You have yellow lines outside an old factory or an old school, but the factory or school is no longer there.

**V/O: **If car drivers have strong views, so do public transport operators as Steven Salmon, Director of Policy Development for the Confederation of Passenger Transport explains.

**Steven Salmon, Director of Policy Development, Confederation of Passenger Transport:** [Well,] we're telling our members that these opportunities don't come along very often, and it's a good chance to poke around in some dusty corners and root out some things which have just become irrelevant over the years.

I'll give you a couple of examples: there's a whole set of regulations on what bus and coach operators have to do with things that get left on the bus, 

**V/O:** Believe it or not, if somebody leaves a box of eggs on the bus, the bus company has to keep it for a full 2 days before it can throw them away.

**Steven Salmon:** And there's another set of regulations which make it illegal, for instance, to have the destination of a bus in capital letters on the front.

**V/O:** Theo de Pencier, Chief Executive, Freight Transport Association says his industry is plagued by bureaucracy and inefficiency.

Theo de Pencier: the level of duplication between particularly the back offices of the executive agencies and so on does result in, if you like, not just one set of bureaucracy to deal with and so on, but several sets of bureaucracy, and the lack of systems integration in the background of those departments also means that members are often having to provide the same information. And if you're a multiple licence holder - let's say a large company with hundreds of locations - the sheer administrative burden of dealing with that and so on for multiple agencies really does impact on your efficiency.

**V/O:** There are all kinds of rules and regulations. But do we really need them? For example, do we need rules specifying the procedure that councils must go through when installing speed humps? They include the minimum (and maximum) heights and the minimum number of lights that must be installed nearby.

Or do motorists really need to have a paper or electronically issued Motor Insurance certificate? Getting rid of this requirement could reduce admin costs for businesses and cut bureaucracy for many people.

**Edmund King:** there are many millions of people involved in road transport every day of the week, and I think they've got something to offer. So really I'd urge people out there, if you've got a pet hate about road transport, come on the website, have a look, it's easy to use. Leave your message, and you could change things for the better.

**Steven Salmon:** We've got over 1,000 enterprises in membership. I'm sure there will be a lot of interest in this, and there's a lot of depth of knowledge amongst our members, who will have, I'm sure, some pet hates which I might not even have heard of, and here's an opportunity to channel, either directly to Government or through CPT, those things that just need a good review.

**Theo de Pencier:** [I mean,] if I had £1 for every time one of my members has stood up at one of our regional freight councils and moaned about the ever-increasing burden of regulation, then I think I'd probably be a very rich man. But what we can now say is get off your backsides - the Government is serous about reducing the burden of regulation. Get involved, make your points, illustrate daft examples of regulation, and I believe we're in with a genuine chance this time of reducing the burden.

**David Cameron:** We need you to get involved and here is the reason. Once you've had your say, ministers will have three months to work out which regulations they want to keep, and why. If they come back with arguments for keeping red tape that we really ought to scrap, I need the evidence on my side, evidence from the real world about the harm these regulations are doing, and what better alternatives there might be. But if you don't go online and get involved, it's going to make deregulation a whole lot harder.

**V/O:** Don't delay, the Red Tape Challenge site is open for your thoughts on the regulation of road transport until 17th June.

## Government social researchers code and publications protocol

All of RSRS's work is carried out in adherence to the government social researchers (GSR) code.

  * [GSR code](http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/networks/gsr/gsr-code)

RSRS has also implemented measures to ensure compliance with the GSR publications protocol introduced in April 2010. This protocol is intended to ensure transparency and openness of government social research, in part by requiring all final research outputs to be published within 12 weeks of the approval of a final draft report.

  * [GSR publications protocol](http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/networks/gsr/publications)

The GSR publications protocol publication table contains a full list of RSRS's research within the scope of the GSR publications protocol or newly commissioned since April 2010.

## Definitions of Common Terms 

### Street works

Works carried out by statutory undertakers, or licensees under section 50 of New Roads and Street Works Act 1980, or their contractors, to install, inspect, maintain, repair or replace apparatus are known as street works.

### Road works (or ""works for road purposes"")

These are works usually carried out by highway authorities to repair, maintain or replace highways, which under highways law includes the footway or pavement. This will include works to replace or maintain street lighting, even if carried out on behalf of the council by an electricity distribution company.

### Statutory undertakers

Most utility companies are statutory undertakers. Statutory undertakers have a statutory right or duty to install, inspect, maintain, repair, or replace apparatus in or under the street in primary legislation.

This legislation is:

  * Gas Act 1986 as amended by the Gas Act 1995 (schedule 3)
  * Electricity Act 1989 (schedule 4)
  * Water Resources Act 1991 (section 159)
  * Telecommunications Act 1984 as amended by schedule 3 of the Communications Act 2003

### Local highway authority

In areas with single tier (""unitary"") authorities this is the local council. In two-tier areas (i.e. where there are district councils and a county council), it is the county council that is the local highway authority. 

In London, for those roads that form the London Strategic Route Network (LSRN) the local highway authority is Transport for London, otherwise it is the London Borough Council. 

For motorways and trunk roads the highway authority is the Highways Agency. 

## General:

**Q1. How do I find out about road works or street works? **

Local authorities maintain a street and road works register that may be accessible through the internet. It is also possible to inspect it by visiting your local authority. The register includes information on planned works, some indication of the nature of the works, and how long they are expected to last.Links to local authority websites can be found at [www.direct.gov.uk](http://www.direct.gov.uk/).

The Highways Agency at [http://www.highways.gov.uk/traffic/traffic.aspx](http://www.highways.gov.uk/traffic/traffic.aspx) has traffic information that will include the impact of road or street works on the motorway and trunk road network.

There is no central database of road works, though many local authorities make information available through the [ELGIN website](http://www.elgin.gov.uk/)

**Q2: Who do I complain to if I'm unhappy about some street works in my area?**

In the first instance you should complain to the utility company, contractor or other organisation responsible for the works. All street works sites should have an information board explaining who is responsible for the works and providing their telephone number. If there is no information board, or you are not satisfied with the response, you may wish to speak to the local highway authority (see Definitions of Common Terms). They should know who is responsible for the works, and are responsible for the coordination and monitoring of works on their road network.

The Department for Transport cannot get involved in individual complaints or disputes between members of the public, street works undertakers and local highway authorities. 

**Q3.What is the current position on undertakers carrying out street works at night?**

Section 56 of NRSWA (New Road and Streetworks Act 1991) allows an authority to direct an undertaker to carry out works at certain times, but only if they believe that the work is likely to cause serious traffic disruption. Authorities need to exercise discretion in the use of this power and cannot direct work to be done at specific times if this conflicts with restrictions on noise or other nuisance. It may be that works cause least disruption to traffic if they are carried out at night or weekends.

If you are concerned about noise you should contact your local authority environmental health or street works manager.

**Q4: Am I entitled to compensation for loss of trade during street works?**

When a highway authority or undertaker carries out works in a road under its statutory powers or duties, there is no general liability in law for loss of trade resulting from a falling away in the number of passers-by and so no liability to pay compensation. It is a long established principle that traders have no right to any particular level of passing trade: business may fluctuate for a number of reasons.

**However**, there may be entitlement to compensation if something is done improperly, for instance if access to business premises is blocked and customers cannot gain access. 

**Gas and Water** - It may be possible for small businesses to claim compensation for losses resulting from works executed by gas companies. Water industry legislation also provides for compensation in certain circumstances. In such cases, it is for the individual trader to raise the matter with the company concerned. However, each claim will be treated on its merits, and it may be difficult to prove that a particular level of trading loss is attributable either wholly or mainly to works in the highway. 

For works by a **highway authority**, there are no plans to introduce a statutory duty to pay compensation for loss of trade. Such works benefit the whole community, including businesses and others, who, while they may be adversely affected in the short term, will benefit in the long term. The highway authority has a statutory obligation to maintain the highway to a reasonable standard. The provision of a compensation scheme would have to be met by either increased local taxation or by reductions in expenditure (perhaps by cutting back on the amount of maintenance undertaken).

**Q5: What is the current policy on trench sharing?**

It is possible for two or more utilities to time their works in such a way that where one company has opened the street in order (for instance) to renew cable or pipe work, others with equipment in the same stretch of road can effect their own repairs before the road surface is reinstated. NRSWA facilitates collaboration, since it requires undertakers to give advance notice to the highway authority and each other of their intention to carry out works in the street. It imposes on the highway authorities a duty to co-ordinate their own and utilities' works in the streets for which they are responsible, while utilities are required to co-operate with the highway authority and each other.

**Q6: When can multi ducting be used?**

It is possible to install purpose-built structures to accommodate multi-ducting when completely new infrastructure is being provided, for instance new housing developments, but in general where apparatus is already in place under existing roads and footways there is little or no scope for their use. Different types of utilities have different requirements as to the depth at which equipment should be laid, and there are hazards associated with laying some equipment (e.g. gas pipes) in enclosed structures. 

**Q7: Does New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 apply when installing apparatus over the highway?**

The definition of street works in the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 (NRSWA) includes ""works…executed in the street…placing apparatus"", includes apparatus installed above the street. Not all requirements in NRSWA will apply, however, and some only apply where the street is being excavated or opened up. Provisions that are likely to be relevant to works installing utility apparatus over the street include:

  * that street works may be executed only by (or on behalf of) an organisation who either has a statutory right to carry out street works (eg by virtue of the Telecommunications Code) or who holds a licence issued by the relevant highway authority under NRSWA;
  * [requirements to give various notices](/publications/street-works-co-ordination/#cop) in respect of the works to the relevant highway authority (or in certain parts of the country to [obtain a permit](/publications/permits/#decision-making) from that authority;
  * the duty to place appropriate traffic signs, and in doing so to comply with the [Safety at street works and road works code of practice](/publications/street-works-safety), the duty to keep records of apparatus in the street.

The statutory duty for street works operatives / supervisors to hold certain qualifications under NRSWA applies only in respect of street works that involve breaking up or opening the street. However, general health and safety duties still apply.

## Safety at Street Works and Road Works:

**Q8: What duties do undertakers have to allow people to get past their works safely?**

Undertakers (mostly utilities) carrying out works in the highway are required by law to have regard to the needs of road users, particularly those with disabilities, when signing, lighting and guarding their works. The [Safety at street works and road works code of practice](/publications/street-works-safety) sets out their specific obligations in detail.

**Q9: When should an information board be displayed?**

An information board must be displayed at every site involving the use of a vehicle. This does not apply to mobile works, and minor works which do not include excavation. The boards should not obstruct footways or carriageways, but should be where they can be read by pedestrians, and possibly stationary drivers.

**Q10: What should the information boards include?**

A. The board must give the name of the organisation for which the works are being carried out, and a telephone number which can be contacted in emergencies. It may contain other information, for instance explaining why the works are being done, who is doing it, and how long it will take. Such additional information is encouraged where practical. A completion date should normally be included if the works are expected to continue for more than a month. 

**Q11: What are the rules governing signing at street works?**

A. [Safety at street works and road works code of practice](/publications/street-works-safety) sets out the minimum and maximum distances for signs leading to works in the road. 

There is no exemption for those engaged on emergency work from compliance with the safety requirements; and undertakers who are likely to be called upon to carry out emergency work should therefore obtain and take with them signs of the correct size for the situations they are likely to be called to attend.

Only the courts can determine liability in the event of an accident where it is claimed that the signing was inadequate and not in accordance with the Safety Code. In all cases, the priority must be to prevent accidents arising from poor signing in the first place.

**Q12: What are the penalties for failing to adhere to the Safety Code?**

Failure to adhere to the Safety Code may under section 65(4) of NRSWA (New Roads and Street Works Act 1991) result in a summary criminal offence which at a Magistrates Court has a maximum penalty of £5,000, but which is unlimited at Crown Court. 

Personal injury claims have to be settled at common law. Such claims are outside the scope of New Roads and Street Works Act 1991.

**Q13: What is the progress on the revision of the Safety Code?**

The revision of the Safety Code is still under consideration after the consultation and with respect to the Government's priorities on reducing regulation. If a decision is taken to publish a new edition of the Code, it is likely to be published in spring 2013 and to come into force in 6-12 months later. This would allow ample time for all concerned to familiarise themselves with the new requirements. We will make further announcements in due course.

## Permits:

**Q16: What is a permit scheme, and what does it achieve? **

A permit scheme requires those carrying out street works or road works to obtain a permit from the highway authority first. A permit system is pro-active as the undertaker has to actively seek permission to work and an authority needs to consider whether it is appropriate to grant the permit. It therefore gives authorities more scope to coordinate the timing of works in order to reduce disruption. Permits can also be granted with conditions attached, for example covering the times of day at which works may be carried out.

**Q17: When a utility applies for a permit to work, what documents need to accompany each application?**

This is a matter for each local authority to consider and it will be defined in their permit scheme.

**Q18: In a permit scheme will the local authorities' own works also have permit conditions?**

Yes, to ensure parity with the utility works, local authorities have to apply similar permit conditions to their own works as they would to a utility led work.

**Q19: Where two or more utilities are carrying out work at the same time as highway maintenance work what level of discount will there be for utility permits? Also, does the local authority have a role in being pro-active in trying to encourage working together?**

Regulations 31(4) of the permit regulations deals with situation where discounts must be applied, when one or more promoters are collaborating to reduce the impact of their works. Provided the objective of reducing impact is met, such circumstances could include:

  * Where an activity is to be carried out in more than one phase;
  * Where an activity is part of a project that involves working on more than one adjacent street. Project in this context means a set of works that is of the order as would take place in a single street but which happens to cover more than one street, e.g. if repairs on a pipe go round a corner from one street into another. It is not intended to cover whole area wide projects in a single permit scheme;
  * Where an activity involves more than one promoter collaborating in a single co-ordinated set of works. Permit Authorities should provide that where highway authority promoters are collaborating with undertakers, those undertakers will be eligible for the discount in regulation 31(5).

**Q20: Will it be clear in the Gazetteer that a permit is required?**

Yes. It will be clear from the Gazetteer if the authority operates a permit scheme and whether this is all streets or just certain streets and if so, which ones.

**Q21: If you have had no response about a permit within a minimum period what happens then?**

In these situations a works promoter can assume that permit is deemed to be granted (each permit will have a fee associated with it).

**Q22: How will utilities know which authorities will be running permit schemes? **

Regulations require a highway authority making an application to the Secretary of State to operate a permit scheme to have carried out a full consultation in relation to the scheme prior to their application, following government's code of practice for consultations. This should include all persons identified as having an interest in any of the streets covered by the permit scheme in the Associated Street Data for those streets.

**Q23: Who must a local authority consult about setting up a permit scheme? Why can they not decide this themselves?**

The permit regulations require a highway authority making an application to the Secretary of State to run a permit scheme to have carried out a full consultation in relation to the scheme. Those stakeholders that must be consulted are set out in regulation 3:

  * every person who carries out works in the proposed specified area from time to time, to the extent the Permit Authority is aware of them doing so; 
  * every local authority other than the Permit Authority in whose area is situated any street to which the proposed permit scheme relates; 
  * where any street to which the proposed permit scheme relates is in Greater London, Transport for London; 
  * where any street to which the proposed permit scheme relates is in the passenger transport area of a Passenger Transport Executive, the relevant Passenger Transport Executive; 
  * the emergency services which operate in the proposed specified area; 
  * the Secretary of State; and 
  * such other persons as the Permit Authority considers appropriate. 

**Q24: Is the notice period prescribed in the code of practice for notices different than for permits? **

No, although Permits and Notices are different regimes the minimum application periods for permits and notice periods for notices are the same. The fundamental difference between permits and noticing is that for permits there is a requirement to obtain permission to carry out activities on the street (effectively booking a time slot), where as noticing is informing the authority of the intention to work. Timescales for the application for permits is given in section 59 of the Permits statutory Guidance and chapter 11 of the Permits Code of Practice.

**Q25: What will be the fee for a permit, are they going to be different for different categories of roads? **

The power to charge a permit fee is detailed in regulations.  The maximum fees chargeable are set out in section 78 of the statutory guidance and Chapter 15 of the permits code of practice. Different categories of road may attract different fee levels.  A highway authority will have to justify the level of permit fees to the Secretary of State in their application to run a scheme.

**Q26: Who pays for administrative costs of highway permits? **

The local authority bears the costs of permits for its own works. In putting forward a permit scheme, the authority needs to ensure that the benefits outweigh the costs incurred in operating a permit scheme.

## Overrun Charges:

**Q27: What powers do authorities have to penalise utilities when they take longer than they should?**

Authorities have the ability to levy charges where the utility takes longer completing works than they agreed with the authority.

**Q28: Why do I see lots of works where there is no one working - authority should financially penalise utilities when this happens? **

There are many legitimate reasons why works are sometimes left unoccupied. These include waiting for materials to cure and gas to vent before work can take place. 

However authorities should agree time frames for works that are challenging but realistic, allowing the works to take place safely but at the same time ensure that the carriageway is not occupied unnecessarily. 

**Q29: Some works still overrun - what is the Government doing about them?**

The Government is proposing to raise the changes that authorities can levy to further reduce the number of works which overrun. 

**Q30: When will the Government raise overrun charges as it states in the DFT business plan?**

The Department has committed in the departmental business plan for the project to be completed by October 2011. 

## Inspections:

**Q31: With a permit system will it be possible to charge for inspections?**

The cost of the inspections will not be included in the permit fees charged to utilities. However, it is expected that these will be provided for when the arrangements for street works inspections are next reformed.

## Street Works Co-ordination: 

**Q32: Street works have just started near me. Can utilities just dig up ",,Department for Transport,Street works frequently asked questions,,Frequently asked questions relating to street works.,,[], 21 July 2011,"Roads, Road management"
,,"the road whenever they want to?**

Disruption of journeys can be very frustrating. Undertakers are legally obliged to give notice of up to three months to the local highway authority - how much depends on what kind of road is affected, and what kind of works are planned. The highway authority has a duty to co-ordinate works on their network - speak to them if you have concerns. It must be remembered, however, that utilities need access to their networks to provide us with essential services.

Local highway authorities can also apply for approval to run permit schemes, under which utilities require the highway authority's permission to carry out works - rather than merely having to notify them.

**Q33: How much notice should I give of my works?**

The [co-ordination code of practice](/publications/street-works-co-ordination/#cop) sets out in detail requirements for undertakers to give notice of their works.

**Q34: Why does the authority not make the utilities do the works at the same time? **

Authorities have a duty to co-ordinate works which includes encouraging joint working. However many works have to be undertaken immediately, such as emergency works or customer connections.

## Lane Rental:

**Q35: What is lane rental?**

Lane rental would involve utility companies (and others undertaking street works) being required to pay a daily charge for the duration of their works. The charge would be paid to the local council (the ""highway authority""). 

**Q36: How would it help?**

A daily charge should encourage utility companies and others to complete their works more quickly and therefore with less disruption to road users and local communities. This is because every day's reduction in the duration of their works would save them a day's charges. 

A well-designed charging system would also include exemptions or discounts from the daily charge when works are completed at less busy times. So by spending a bit more - say on overtime to get the job done at evenings or weekends - utilities and others carrying out works could avoid having to pay the charges.

**Q37: Why can't local authorities charge lane rental today?**

Local authorities need legal powers in order to impose charges on others. New Regulations are needed - and these will set out things like the maximum charge rate that a local authority can impose.

Once the Regulations are in place, any local authority wishing to impose lane rental charges will need the approval of the Secretary of State for Transport. He will need to be satisfied that any scheme proposals will deliver a reduction in congestion and disruption that is large enough to justify the extra costs that would be involved for utility companies and others. 

**Q38: Does this mean lane rental will be happening all over the country?**

Lane rental has not yet been proven to be a successful model in the UK. In the first instance, any lane rental schemes would need to be targeted just on the very busiest streets in a particular area - likely to include key junctions and other pinch-points, plus the busiest and most congested stretches of road. It is also envisaged that approval would be granted only for a very small number of trial schemes.

Evidence of the effects of any initial pilot schemes will inform future decisions on whether lane rental could usefully play a wider role.

**Q39: What will happen to the revenues paid by utility companies and others?**

The revenues would accrue to the local council responsible for the scheme - the ""highway authority"". The new Regulations will need to set out what the revenues can be used for.

**Q40: What will the new Regulations say? When will they be published?**

The Department for Transport's business plan sys we will consult on new Regulations for lane rental, and finalise them in December 2011. We expect to be consulting on the draft Regulations, and some supporting guidance, over the summer. 

**Q41: When will lane rental charging be up and running?**

It will be for local authorities to develop proposals for lane rental, and submit them to the Secretary of State for Transport. We will be publishing guidance to explain what conditions will need to be met in order for a proposed scheme to be approved. 

It will be possible to approve schemes once the new Regulations are in force - but this will depend on high-quality scheme proposals being submitted by interested local authorities.

**Q42: Will there be lane rental in my area?**

At present, the Department is only contemplating a very small number of local ""pilot"" schemes, targeted on the very busiest and most congested streets. We cannot yet say where those places will be - this will depend on what proposals are developed by local authorities, and which of these are ultimately approved by the Secretary of State.

## Specification for Reinstatement of Openings in Highways:

**Q43: What powers do authorities have if utility reinstatements are not good enough? Can authorities make utilities rectify the problem?**

Utility reinstatements have to meet the standard set out in the code of practice Specifications for the Reinstatement of Openings in the Highways. If it does not meet this standard, and it is within the guarantee period (two or three years for deep excavations) the highway authority can make the utility to put good the fault. 

## Queries Regarding Highways Act 1980:

**Q44: What are the rules covering obstruction of the highway by a shop's goods?**  
** **  
Obstruction of the highway is dealt with in sections 137, 143, 148, and 149 of the Highways Act 1980. It is an offence to deposit anything on the highway which ""interrupts"" a person using the highway. This includes the pavement (known as a ""footway""), which under highways law is a part of the highway. The highway authority can give notice requiring the removal of anything constituting a nuisance. The law applies as much to footways as to those parts of the highway which are designated for use by vehicles.

When looking at individual cases the first step should be to determine whether the land on which items are deposited forms part of the highway. Sometimes the land in front of a shop is not part of the highway, but is private property to which the public have access on the sufferance of the landowner. This may occur, for instance, where a shop owner has paved over land in his ownership immediately in front of his shop and removed any barrier separating it from the footway which forms part of the highway. Thus, an authority has no power to take action under the Highways Act if the owner chooses to advertise his services by means of a board placed on his own land. They do however have certain powers under section 166 of the Act to require forecourts of premises abutting a street to be fenced if they consider the display of goods to be a source of danger, obstruction, or inconvenience to the public. 

**Q45: What are the penalties for a shopkeeper obstructing the highway?**

Where it is clear that a shopkeeper has been depositing goods or advertising boards on a footway forming part of the highway, the provisions of the Highways Act 1980 apply and it is for the highway authority to decide what action to take. Where, for example, they consider that this constitutes a nuisance to users of the highway, they have powers under section 149 of the 1980 Act to serve a notice on the person responsible for depositing anything on the highway to remove it forthwith, or where they believe it constitutes a danger to the public, to recover it themselves immediately. A highway authority can apply to a magistrates court to recover their reasonable expenses and obtain a disposal order where they have taken action themselves to remove an obstruction on the highway.

Legal action by the highway authority is of course a final resort. In many cases of encroachment onto a footway by a retailer which constitutes a nuisance, discussion between the authority and the offender can be expected to bring about an acceptable compromise without the need for the authority to prosecute.

**Q46: What are the rules governing skips on the highway?**

Under section 139 of the Highways Act 1980 a builder's skip may lawfully stand on the highway, but only with the consent of the local highway authority, and subject to the conditions that the local authority sets, which must include requirements for lighting and guarding the skip and the manner in which it is to be coated with paint or other material to enhance visibility. Under section 139(4) of the 1980 Act it is an offence, punishable by a fine, to deposit a skip on the highway but not comply with any conditions the authority may have imposed, or with regulations imposing marking requirements.

**Q47: What are the rules on skip lighting?**

Skips are currently required by section 139(4) of the Highways Act 1980 to be ""properly lighted during the hours of darkness"".  It is for the highway authority, when granting permission for the skip to be placed on the highway, to specify ""the manner in which it is to be lighted or guarded. This matter is not regulated. Skips are also required to have reflective markings, prescribed by the Builders' Skips (Markings) Regulations 1984.

**Q48: Can I claim compensation for tripping over an uneven pavement?**

The Department cannot advise on this issue. If you feel you might have a case for compensation, you should seek professional legal advice.

**Q49: How do I go about finding out how to get the footpath lowered outside my address?**

Your local Council, acting as the highway authority, is responsible for maintaining the footpath. If you want the path lowered so that you can cross the footway to park a car, this would have to be approved by your local council. They would usually commission someone to do the work.

## AT - Approved tourist symbol drawings

Working drawings available as PDF files now include a group headed ""AT - Approved tourist symbol drawings"". The Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions 2002, in Schedule 16, items 24 and 33, make reference to ""approved symbols"". These are tourist attraction symbols which from time to time are introduced by the Department and can be used without special authorisation.

Where a non-prescribed symbol is authorised for a specific attraction it does not necessarily become an approved symbol. Those symbols that are approved will be shown on working drawings prefixed by ""AT"" and made available on this website.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/transport-direct-tools,91,"## White labelling, web services, iFrames and other services

For Transport Direct white labelling is about providing our services through a third party. Transport Direct is working with organisations to bring easily accessible and reliable transport information directly to people using the internet for a wide variety of reasons.

Transport Direct's ""White Label"" schemes allow external organisations to present Transport Direct's door-to door planner on their own website, in their own corporate branding. This results in a value-added and seamless 'customer journey' for external organisation whilst enabling Transport Direct to reach people who may not have been aware of the benefits of planning their travel with Transport Direct. White labelling sites include the BBC, Visit Britain and Directgov.

  * [Contact us](http://www.dft.gov.uk/transportdirect/about/contactus) for more information
  * [A short guide to Transport Direct's white labelling services (PDF - 460 KB)](http://assets.dft.gov.uk/publications/transport-direct-tools/white-label-service.pdf)

There are some restrictions for some third parties who require White labelling due to the data agreements that we have in place.

We can also offer third parties a cycle planner white label.

## Web services

Transport Direct offers the back office services that are called and used by you. We expose some web services through APIs and send you back XML data for you to display on your own user interface.

The advantage of this is that the user interface and branding is entirely yours. You determine the look and feel of how the information is presented and you can fit in the travel information with the rest of your business processes ensuring the user remains on your site.

For such infrastructure you may need to create a new user interface for the presentation of this information and there maybe a requirement to pay on an ongoing basis per transaction depending on usage.

This solution may be particularly useful to non PC based channels such as the travel content for mobile devices or for interactive TV.

## iframes

IFrames can be used for placing content from another page or website onto a web page. You can position an iFrame on a page and treat it rather like an ordinary graphic. The iFrame (Transport Direct) works independently from the third party web page that displays it. Transport Direct hosts the iFrame, which is one of the differences compared to say page landing.

We have developed a mini Transport Direct journey planner, with results opening in a new tab or browser window.

## Joining up Government services - Project Lauren

From August 2006 the Department for Work and Pensions has utilised the Transport Direct back-office processing to generate a tailored journey plan that accompanies the appointment letters for the medical assessments for Incapacity Benefit arranged each year. About 1 million of these letters together with a personalised journey plan are sent out annually. These show how the recipient can travel from their home to the assessment centre. It is expected that this will help to reduce the 20% 'no show' rate for these assessments.

The Transport Direct team is working with other Government services that require people to travel to places by providing journey itineraries for how to get to those places.

## Transcript

I'm sorry I can't be with you today, but I would like to thank the Trees and Design Action Group for giving me this opportunity to talk to you about the importance of trees in the urban environment.

Two important documents are being launched today - Trees in the Townscape, and a report on the findings from the UK i-Tree Eco pilot project. This event also marks the launch of Neighbourhoods Green's Tree Management Toolkit - a web-based source of advice which promotes well managed green space in housing estates.

We tend to take trees for granted and that's maybe why we need organisations such as the Trees and Design Action Group. We need to be reminded on how tree planting can enhance urban environments and that the protection of existing trees is just as important. It's worth noting that the advantages of trees are in proportion to their size - large mature trees bring more benefits than smaller ones do.

The Department for Transport has long recognised the value of trees and other planting in urban environments. In 2007, the Manual for Streets was published, this focused on the design of residential streets. In 2010, the Chartered Institution of Highways & Transportation published a key piece of complementary guidance - Manual for Streets 2 - Wider Application of the Principles. It extended the original Manual for Streets principles to fill the gap between residential streets and trunk roads.

Both documents represented a radical change in approach to street design, and both recognise the value that trees impart to our daily lives. They emphasise that trees bring a wide range of benefits to individuals and to society as a whole. 

First and foremost, trees contribute to character and distinctiveness, they create visual interest, more importantly perhaps, they help improve the air quality, and they help to soften the street scene. In essence, they are an excellent place-making tool in urban design.

But, their potential contribution goes beyond that. Trees provide habitats for wildlife and they have a role to play in climate change. They can provide shade and reduce the local environmental temperature. They can also slow down the rate at which rainfall enters the drainage system. The recent floods have highlighted the importance of good surface water management, and trees can play their part here.

As a driver, I am in no doubt that a lovely avenue of trees makes a journey more pleasant, whether in a town setting or in the countryside. The French certainly understand this. I recommend the old main road from Dieppe to Paris, still with its lines of trees but delightfully much freer of traffic. And I am proud that, before I was a minister, I stopped the Highways Agency from cutting down a wonderful run of mature trees along the central reservation of the A27 in my constituency of Lewes. They were concerned that they could be dangerous for any motorist veering off the carriageway. I am happy to say they agreed to my suggestion for crash barriers instead, and so the trees continue to give pleasure to thousands of motorists day in, day out.

On top of all this, trees make financial sense. The economic, environmental and social benefits arising from street trees vastly outweigh the cost of providing and maintaining them. The i-Tree report being launched today is testimony to this.

But how can we turn all of this into reality? 

The target audience for Trees in the Townscape is decision makers, especially local councillors who are setting out policy. So a good starting point is to take heed of the 12 key principles that ""Trees in the Townscape"" puts forward. They form a sound basis for any local authority policy on street trees. 

Putting these principles into action does rely on a considerable amount of collaborative working between various disciplines and interested parties, in much the same way as Manual for Streets 1 and 2 strongly advocate.

Hopefully, designers will already be familiar with what the Manuals say about trees, but it doesn't hurt to remind them that planting should be integrated into street designs wherever possible. And they should remember that the early involvement of stakeholders often pays dividends - for example, relatively minor scheme adjustments such as slightly realigning a carriageway to avoid a mature tree, could cause all sorts of problems if that same adjustment comes as an afterthought late in the design process.

But collaboration needs to take place at all levels. In March, I launched the opening of the Greater Bristol Bus Network scheme. With support from the Government, Bristol City Council worked with Bath and North East Somerset, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire Councils to create a reliable bus network for the 52 million bus journeys made in the Greater Bristol area each year. The results are impressive but I particularly appreciated the attention given to street trees. £1.2 million was earmarked for additional landscaping and this resulted in the planting of 500 new trees along 10 key bus routes in the city.

As I mentioned earlier, the Department for Transport has long recognised the value of trees and other planting in urban environments. When you look at the myriad benefits street trees bring about, it becomes obvious that the advantages cut across the interests of many different parts of Government. My hope is that close inter-departmental cooperation on this issue in the future means that we will see more trees in our towns and cities. 

Thank you for listening and please accept my wishes for a successful launch event for these three important sources of advice.

Thank you.

## Background information

  * Quarterly estimates are based on a panel of the 18 largest non-metropolitan operators, Passenger Transport Executives (for metropolitan areas) and Transport for London (TfL). The panel covers over 90 per cent of the journeys made in Great Britain. Data from the quarterly panel is scaled to annual figures from the Department's main annual survey of 700 PSV operators, and figures are then seasonally adjusted. More information is in the Guidance Notes (see link in Related Information below).
  * The quarterly figures are less precise than the annual statistics which aim to report on all journeys, including those covered by smaller operators.
  * Quarterly figures are subject to revision due to the nature of the seasonal adjustment, and scaling to annual figures. However, these will typically be minor and not affect overall patterns shown

Good afternoon

Thank you for once again inviting me to give the keynote address on the opening day of the 21st annual Surveyor Winter Conference and Exhibition.

My apologies that I am unable to be in Coventry in person to give this speech. 

Like all of you at this two day Conference, I take the issue of winter preparations very seriously indeed. Whilst I am pleased to say that last winter's weather was not as severe as in previous years, all parts of the country did naturally still experience spells of snow, freezing rain and below average temperatures. 

As we all know, our weather can be unpredictable and I recall hearing of a cricket match in Derbyshire having play stopped in June due to snow. So it is vital that we do not become complacent and as transport operators we all have robust contingency plans in place to deal with any eventuality.

It is essential that we do everything possible to keep our transport infrastructure - both strategic and local roads, rail network, as well as our airports and port facilities - operating as efficiently and safely as possible.

If we don't there is personal inconvenience. But there is also a wider economic impact. The Report that we published in December last year highlighted that the total cost of delayed journeys to both businesses and individuals due to snow was estimated to be around £280m a day in England alone.

That is why it is important that we continue to build on the recommendations arising from the Quarmby Winter Resilience Report and Audit and the Transport Select Committee report following an Inquiry they undertook in 2011, to ensure that we continue to be in a resilient position as we head into this winter.

We at the Department for Transport are determined to stay ahead of the game.

We continue to work closely with the Met Office to make sure that we have the best advice available to prepare for severe winter weather. 

I note that you will be hearing from Dr Adam Scaife from the Met Office tomorrow afternoon in respect of weather forecasting. I was pleased to see that the Met Office have taken steps to improve their service and last year launched improvements to the National Severe Weather Service which allows more targeted forecasting of potential impacts from severe weather.

We continue to maintain a substantial national strategic salt reserve and have a robust distribution process in place, if for any reason this salt of last resort needs to be allocated.

The findings of the recent salt audit undertaken by the Department suggests local highway authorities will enter the winter with a healthy supply. 

Authorities continue to place orders with domestic salt suppliers and are receiving stocks. This demonstrates that the supply chain is also in a much better position than a few years ago.

The Department will, as in previous years, continue to monitor salt stocks that are held by authorities across the country, as well as the Highways Agency, on a monthly basis. 

It is vital that authorities continue to help us with this activity so we can ensure the country continues to have a good level of resilience. Your co-operation in this is very much appreciated.

Finally, my officials are currently updating the Strategic Salt Protocol Note that we published on the Department's website last year. This note sets out the arrangements for the allocation of strategic salt, if and when required, including the price of salt per tonne. I hope that we will be in a position to publish an updated Note in early October. 

p>

Of course salt is just one issue in ensuring we keep disruption on the transport network to a minimum in the event of severe winter weather, and it is worth highlighting briefly what other modes are also doing to ensure that we enter winter well prepared.

The Highways Agency is currently finalising preparations for its winter driving campaign - 'Make time for winter' - which will commence on 29 October 2012. 

This year the messages will place emphasis on drivers taking more responsibility for their own actions based around two key themes, 'Be prepared' and 'Be informed'.

The purpose of the campaign is to alert drivers to the steps they should take, such as ensuring their vehicles are roadworthy, that they have emergency travel kits in their vehicles, that they drive sensibly and take precautions while travelling, and make use of weather-related traffic and travel information (both before and during their journeys) to make informed decisions - about whether to travel at all.

This year the Highways Agency will continue to work with the freight industry and its campaign messages will be shared with partners and stakeholders including the Road Haulage Association, Freight Transport Association and other independent contractors to assist HGV drivers and freight organisations in preparing for driving in winter. 

This year's winter campaign messages will also feature at ports and truckstops including a range of posters translated into several European languages including, Spanish, French, Polish, German and Italian.

Following our experiences over the last three winters the Agency has a good story to tell. They now have a fleet of more than 500 winter vehicles for treating motorways and major 'A' roads around the clock to help keep the strategic network open under all but the most extreme of circumstances. 

However, when sudden spells of very severe weather coincide with periods of heavy traffic, it is not always possible to prevent congestion and delays, as our winter service vehicles need space to treat the roads quickly and effectively. 

Therefore it's vital that road users - HGV and car drivers alike - give the Agency fleet and their contractors the space to do their jobs following bouts of severe weather. 

On the rail network I am also pleased to say that Train Operating Companies and Network Rail have taken steps to learn lessons from the severe weather in previous winters and apply them in preparing for this one. 

Let me give you just a couple of examples - although I also am aware that you will be hearing from Tony Jackson from Network Rail tomorrow.

Network Rail has Key Route Strategies, which set out arrangements for keeping lines and critical junctions open. On the routes which are electrified with a 'third rail', principally those south of the River Thames in South East England, Network Rail has introduced heating of the conductor rail in critical locations, which will keep it clear of snow and ice.

Network Rail has also introduced improved snow and ice clearance trains, including a snow plough and equipment to keep the conductor rail clear of ice and snow. In some locations, extra point heaters have been installed to ensure that points remain operational during freezing weather and maintenance has been carried out on existing point heaters to ensure their reliability. 

Train Operating Companies have also undertaken maintenance work on their train fleets to ensure reliability during winter operation. This has included actions to minimise problems with frozen sliding doors and frozen couplings. Some fleets on the 'third rail' network have been equipped to spray de-icing fluid in order to keep the conductor rail clear of ice and snow. 

Contingency timetables have also been produced which can be introduced in the event of severe winter weather. These have been validated by Network Rail to ensure that they are capable of being operated robustly. Improvements in timetabling software mean that these can be uploaded to industry journey planning systems overnight, which will allow passengers to have an accurate picture of the level of service being operated.

I am also pleased to say that changes have been made to passenger information systems at stations to improve the accuracy and timeliness of information available to passengers when services are disrupted. These improvements worked very well last year. In addition, some Train Operating Companies are now using social media such as Twitter to disseminate information to passengers in real time. 

I am also pleased that following the disruption to air services at UK airports during the winters of 2009 and 2010, the aviation industry has also taken significant steps to improve its resilience to severe winter weather.

The busiest airports, Heathrow and Gatwick, have made significant investments in additional snow and ice clearance capacity. For example, Heathrow has tripled its clearance vehicle fleet and quadrupled staff numbers available for snow clearance.

Both these airports, and indeed others, have revised their operational command and control procedures to improve their response to severe weather, including working in closer co-operation with airlines and other transport providers.

In addition, websites and social media provided updated flight information to ensure that passengers could fly with the minimum amount of disruption. For those passengers who were unfortunate to have a flight cancelled, the airport and airline operators had robust plans in place to inform those passengers in advance so they could make alternative arrangements or arrive at the airport at a later time.

Last but not least, we all know the importance to the UK economy of ensuring that our port operations remain open during the any severe winter weather event. My officials are working closely with port operators to ensure they build on lessons learnt from previous years and have the right winter management plans in place.

I appreciate the significant efforts that have already been made this year across all transport modes to boost our resilience and preparedness for possible severe winter weather and I hope that any disruption that may occur is kept to a minimum due to the plans that are in place to ensure that the transport system recovers as quickly as possible.

However we must not become complacent. We all should remain alert to ensure that we can tackle any severe winter weather that we may encounter this winter season.

Thank you. Enjoy the Conference.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/electric-vehicle-event-adastral-park-martlesham-heath-suffolk,190,"## Transcript

I am sorry not to be able to be with you today at Adastral Park - but delighted to be able to join you in your Electric Vehicle event today - by video - and offer my support.

I understand that Adastral Park has always been a pretty cutting edge sort of place with a [stellar] name to reflect its history of experimentation and innovation - in aeronautics first off[1], and then as home for British Telecom's global innovation and development centre.

In a way, it is emblematic of the kind of advance that is being made now with plug in vehicles - with new models coming to market and an ever-widening network of charge points around the country.

The Source East team have made impressive progress, with partners in the public and private sector, to get this bedded in around the East of England.

BT charge points are a welcome addition to the network. So too will be Hutchison Ports' new points at Felixstowe that go into service today - connecting UK's largest container port to the Plugged In vehicle network.

Access to workplace charge points helps to build the case for people moving to the Electric Vehicle option and I fully expect that your lead will encourage other companies to follow.

You have got a number of electric vehicles on site today. I hope everyone who wants to gets the chance to test them out and feel how they drive.

Another welcome development is Source East and green energy UK's announcement of their new partnership - which gives Source East members access to discounted green energy for home charging over night.

For many Electric Vehicle drivers, that is going to be the routine - delivering major savings on running costs and freedom from fuel forecourt queuing.

This is a time of innovation and ground-breaking technology development - much of it happening here in the UK.

It is giving motorists great new driving opportunities - which will as well help put a significant dent in our carbon emissions and create new opportunities for economic growth.

The Coalition Government is four square behind this. We have made a £400 million commitment, among other things to support grants for plug in cars and plug in vans and to provide funding for Plugged In Places like Source East.

I hope you have a very good day and make the most of testing out the new kit.

The Department has published guidelines on the level of monitoring and evaluation we require Local Authority Major Scheme promoters to carry out for 'Supported Pool' and 'Development Pool' Local Authority Major Schemes.

Monitoring and evaluating the investment in Major Schemes is important to assess whether the programme has delivered value for money and to ensure that lessons are learnt for further investment decisions.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/high-speed-rail-addendum-2,194,"## Summary

On 10 January 2012, the Government announced its decision to develop a new national high speed rail network following the completion of a major public consultation.

On 29 May, the consultation responses were published online. We have discovered, since then, that a small number of responses submitted online (722 of around 55,000 submitted in total) were not analysed fully by Dialogue by Design (DbyD) due to technical errors. For these responses, the answers to one or more of the seven consultation questions were omitted from DbyD's analysis. In total, approximately 0.4% of answers provided to individual consultation questions were affected.

This addendum report is a supplementary analysis by DbyD of the seven hundred and twenty two (722) affected consultation responses submitted online. The report concludes that the affected responses 'do not provide any information that was not already included in the previous Consultation Summary Report or would have made a difference to the substantive content or balance of that report'.

The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport issued a statement about this to Parliament on 18 September 2012 explaining that the cause has been identified as technical errors in transferring data captured from online consultation responses to the consultation analysis database held by DbyD.

All those who submitted the responses affected have been contacted with details of their particular cases to notify them and apologise.

HS2 will be a national high-speed rail network linking Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds with London and Heathrow. This video sets out the property and compensation proposals for the first stage of the network between London and the West Midlands.

HS2 will bring transformational benefits to the UK: major investment; new jobs; regeneration in cities; improved connectivity, faster journeys and freeing up capacity on existing rail lines, which are becoming increasingly congested.

But such a major project will also have environmental impacts and affect local property markets. The government has already worked hard to minimise the impact of HS2 on the landscape, protecting the countryside and local communities as far as possible by adding more tunnels and making changes to the proposed route between London and Birmingham.

Current law provides appropriate compensation for the vast majority of infrastructure projects.  
HS2 will be an exceptional construction project - the biggest seen in the UK since Victorian times. Because of the exceptional nature of HS2 we believe it is right to go above and beyond what is set out in law.

So what is being proposed?

The six key elements of the government's proposals to help those affected by HS2 are as follows:

### Proposal 1: a streamlined advanced purchase

This simplifies the compensation process for property owners in HS2's safeguarded area; this is land that needs to be protected from any other conflicting developments.

### Proposal 2: a voluntary purchase scheme

This is for rural areas where the line is not in deep bored tunnels. Property owners within 120 metres of either side of the line, but outside the safeguarded area, could ask the government to buy their property for its unblighted market value, that is what it would have been worth if there had been no plans for HS2.

### Proposal 3: a sale and rent-back scheme

This would give greater flexibility for the homeowners whose properties need to be demolished. They could sell their properties to the Government, but remain living in them as tenants until the properties are required.

### Proposal 4: a long term hardship scheme

This would provide cover for properties beyond the voluntary purchase zone. It would help those who have a strong personal need to move but, because of HS2, cannot sell their home other than at a significant loss.

### Proposal 5: properties above tunnels

To provide confidence in properties above tunnels the Government will offer before and after surveys and settlement deeds and guarantee forever the rectification costs of any settlement or subsidence issues caused to properties by tunnelling.

### Proposal 6: Social rented housing

The government will work with local authorities, housing associations and affected tenants to develop a strategy to replace any social rented housing lost as a result of HS2.

The Government's proposals are designed to ensure that property owners and occupiers receive as much certainty as possible, as early as possible.

The government would like your views on these proposals. For more information please visit [http://highspeedrail.dft.gov.uk/](http://highspeedrail.dft.gov.uk/).

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/investing-in-future-transport-conference-london-city-hall,196,"## Transcript

I am sorry not to be able to be present at your conference today - but delighted to have the opportunity to say a few words to open this afternoon's session - focused as it is on the challenge of transport in an urban environment.

For me, the theme chimes in very closely with the work that I have been pushing forward while I have been in Government.

In a nutshell - developing a transport system that creates growth - and cuts emissions. Especially carbon emissions. 

Clearly how we get around in the future - whether in cities or elsewhere - will have a huge impact on how we achieve these aims.

Around a quarter of UK domestic carbon emissions are from transport - and over 90 per cent of those are from road traffic.M

It's worth pointing out, as did last month's UK Climate Change Committee report, the good progress being made in reducing emissions from new cars.

A 4.2% reduction between 2010 and 2011, and on track to meet the indicator target for 2020 - 95 grammes of CO2 per kilometre. That is good news. But of course we want to go further.

The UK Government has been determined to create the right conditions for the development of the early market for ultra low emission vehicles - ULEVs [youlevs] as they are known. We have made a £400m commitment. 

Last year we put in place the Plug-In Car Grant and extended it to vans this year. This has helped generate a step change in the uptake of ULEVs.

Total claims in the first half of this year are more than we saw in the whole of 2011. 

And with new models coming to the market, I expect to see this trend sustained and growing, in line with our expectations.

Of course it is the case that people are hardly likely to buy a ULEV if they don't see the infrastructure needed to use them already in place. 

So, the Coalition Government has taken a lead on this with the Plugged In Places programme. And I'm delighted that, as we anticipated, the private sector has now seen the commercial opportunity this presents and come in with really significant investment. 

Further evidence, if any more were needed, that creating growth and cutting carbon are 2 sides of the same coin.

The combined number of private and public sector charge-points now stands at around six thousand.

Of course hydrogen is also one of the options to decarbonise transport. 

With industry we have set up the UK H2 Mobility project.

It's looking at the potential for ""hydrogen fuel cell"" electric vehicles - and what investment would be required to commercialise the technology, including refuelling infrastructure, from 2015. 

It is good news that London, where there is already a significant level of hydrogen activity, is pitching for a leading role in this field.

As well as having ULEV responsibilities, my portfolio also covers what's known as ""smarter choices"". Changing the way we travel isn't just about changing the car we drive or how we deliver goods.

It's about thinking differently - even as far as thinking whether on each occasion we need to travel at all, now we are in the age of video-conferencing and other ground-shifting technology.

These Olympics have been like a test bed, stimulating people to try fresh approaches and allowing individuals and organisations to re-engineer how they go about their business. I hope and expect that these changes won't be a one-off.

For many of you here today the focus of interest will be London. 

And London has certainly been rich with innovation on the transport front.

But countrywide, funding made available by the Government, like the £560m Local Sustainable Transport Fund, now increased to £600m, the Green Bus Fund, and funding for the low carbon truck demonstration trial, is helping to spark real innovation. 

Let's remember, it is the short-distance local trip where the biggest opportunity exists for people to make sustainable transport choices.

Around two out of every three trips we make are less than 5 miles in length. Many of them could be easily walked or undertaken by public transport, with cycling an increasingly popular option.

I have been determined to help deliver funding to create an environment where people can feel confident about cycling.

There are some really good projects going on around the country.

Now I am not complacent in the least about any of this. There are huge challenges in transport, not least in terms of air quality where there is still much to do.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/msrs-scheme,203,"## About this guide

This guide outlines the criteria and processes in place for applying for support from the Mode Shift Revenue Support scheme, also known as MSRS. Although information is correct at the time of publication, it is advisable that potential applicants contact the appropriate administrative body for the most up to date information before submitting a formal application for grant.

It should be noted that there is no automatic entitlement to grant support and any offer of grant which may be made remains entirely at the discretion of the appropriate administrative body.

## What is MSRS?

MSRS assists companies with the operating costs associated with running rail or inland water freight transport instead of road, where rail or inland waterway transport is more expensive. It is designed to facilitate and support modal shift, generating environmental and wider social benefits from reduced lorry journeys on Britain's roads. The scheme operates in two parts:

  * MSRS (Intermodal) for the purchase of intermodal container movements by rail; and
  * MSRS (Bulk and Waterways) for the purchase of other freight traffic movements by rail and all movements by inland waterway.

MSRS is a direct replacement for both the Rail Environmental benefit Procurement Scheme (REPS) and the Waterborne Freight Grant for inland waterways.

Further details on MSRS (Intermodal) can be found in section 2, MSRS (Bulk and Waterways) in section 3 and how to apply for both schemes in section 4.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/noise-exposure-contours,206,"## Summary

The Environmental Research and Consultancy Department (ERCD) of the Civil Aviation Authority estimates the noise exposures around the London airports (Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted) on behalf of the Department for Transport. The magnitude and extent of the aircraft noise around these airports are depicted on maps by contours of constant aircraft noise index (Leq) values. The contours are generated by a computer model validated with noise measurements, which calculates the emissions and propagation of noise from arriving and departing air traffic.

## Detail

ERCD produce annual reports on noise exposure contours at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted and previous copies of these - back to 1997- are available on this website. These are detailed reports and essential reading for those wishing to understand both how noise exposure contours are produced and how they should be interpreted.

The annual reports include small scale diagrams of noise exposure contours which provide an overall impression of their proximity to major towns.

For those wishing to see more detailed representation of noise exposure contours on the ground, ERCD also produces contours overlaid on larger scale Ordnance Survey paper maps ( 1:50,000 ) or, more recently, in AutoCad DXF format (previously supplied on CD-ROM), the latter primarily used by specialist users such as town planners, consultants etc. Both of these have traditionally been available for purchase from the Department as described in the annual reports.

## Change to presentation of 2005 contours onwards

Annual reports for Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted are available on the website as before.

With effect from 2005, additional representation of noise exposure contours on Ordnance Survey maps has been made available on this website in two formats.

## PDF

**For the non specialist user** in particular, a PDF version of each of the large scale Ordnance Survey maps is available for viewing and downloading. Please note, however, that these are large documents and may take some time to download.

## AutoCad DXF

**For the specialist user** requiring greater detail, AutoCad DXF files are available on the website for download. (These allow the user to plot the contours on any scale of map).

Please note that in order to gain the best reproduction of contours on a larger scale Ordnance Survey map, it is necessary to have software that is capable of reading DXF files.

Please also note that in view of the large size of the files, they have been compressed using WinZip and will need to be 'unzipped' after being downloaded.

## Printed Maps

Contours overlaid on large scale Ordnance Survey paper maps (1:50,000) continue to be available, at a charge, as described in the annual reports. Although the information/scale presented is exactly same as in the PDF version (see above), the printed maps are larger.

Hello, I'm sorry I can't be with you in person today… but, courtesy of video technology, I'm pleased that I can at least make a small contribution to the proceedings.

At the end of last year I explained why I believe we will only be successful in our transport strategy - of creating growth and cutting carbon - if we effect behavioural change and provide genuinely sustainable transport. I also spoke about the role of biofuels within our strategy.

We have made some significant progress since then, both in terms of assuring the sustainability of biofuels used in the UK and in respect of investment and growth.

Building on voluntary reporting under the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (the RTFO) we took an important step last December with the introduction of mandatory sustainability criteria.

Earlier this year the first biofuels meeting that criteria were reported. This was only achieved by working closely with suppliers, and the RTFO Administrator continues to ensure suppliers get the advice they need. 

UK-produced biofuels have shown some potentially high carbon savings compared with fossil fuels. 

Provisional data reported for UK feedstocks under the RTFO suggests greenhouse gas savings from biofuel made from UK feedstocks was 77%.

The volume of UK produced biofuel has also increased in the first three years of the RTFO - from 109 to 331 million litres per year.

As assurance of the carbon reduction credentials of biofuels has improved, so we have also witnessed examples of growth in the UK.

I was very pleased to be asked to open the impressive Agri Energy biodiesel plant in Bootle in Liverpool in May - and I understand that you will be hearing more about this project today. 

It is imperative that we keep seeing profitable investments like this which produce low carbon energy. In the UK, enterprise like this can create jobs and develop expertise in the biofuels industry and help us to meet our ambitious carbon reduction targets. 

I was similarly encouraged by Vivergo's investment in Hull and its ambition to become the largest bioethanol and animal feed producer in Europe. It is another significant investment in the UK's future and energy infrastructure and an example of British ingenuity and co-operation. 

So I'm seeing some really encouraging signs out there…..green UK businesses are showing how partnerships between companies - and the sharing of knowledge and expertise across different industries - can provide models with the potential to deliver genuinely sustainable product and minimise waste.

I am proud of the UK's progress. I also recognise that the role of Government is to sustain a fertile investment climate. So my aim is to provide a clear policy framework. One based on good scientific evidence and which provides assurance of the sustainability of biofuels. 

We are clear that biofuels have a role to play in tackling climate change, particularly where we cannot otherwise easily decarbonise, such as in aviation and HGVs. However, the Coalition Government is adamant that wherever they are used, biofuels must be genuinely sustainable. We remain very concerned that studies and impact assessments have demonstrated that some biofuels actually produce greater carbon emissions than fossil fuels, particularly when indirect land use change is factored in. 

We continue to press the European Commission for clarity on indirect land use change policy and I have written to EU Commissioners to press the UK's position more than once.

But let me be candid about this - I do not believe that setting further short-term interim targets can in practice provide the clarity industry needs while the issue of indirect land use change remains to be properly tackled by the European Commission. 

I believe we should firmly entrench the goalposts as soon as we can, but only when we are confident that we do not have to move them again.

In April, the Bioenergy Strategy, a cross-Whitehall strategy was released.

This recognises the importance of low ILUC-risk first generation biofuels. 

It also acknowledges that, in the medium-to-longer term, we will need to develop second generation and other advanced biofuels. 

We will continue to review how best to support this growing industry and meet our greenhouse gas emission and energy targets.

To incentivise advanced biofuels and waste derived biofuels, we have introduced double rewards under the RTFO.

This is because these feedstocks are unlikely to compete with food production or contribute to indirect land use change. 

I accept that there are concerns regarding the fluctuation of the value of RTFCs. This year is unique because of amendments to the RTFO in December. So it's probably too soon to tell whether the recent RTFC prices reflect a longer term trend. 

We will continue to consider the impacts of double certification, and I have committed to review double certification in 2013 to ensure that it is having a positive effect on the biofuel industry. 

We are interested in the potential to use biofuels in sectors where options to decarbonise are limited. 

For example the potential use of sustainable biomethane made from waste in the heavy goods vehicle sector. 

There are real market barriers to uptake of low emission Heavy Goods Vehicle technologies such as hybrid, electric and gas. 

The Government has made available £9.5m capital funding to pump prime procurement - via the Low Carbon Truck demonstration trial, launched in March.

Successful applicants will get targeted funding for refuelling infrastructure, and for low carbon vehicles like gas and dual fuel trucks.

Biofuels are of course just one part of a wider strategy to encourage growth and cut carbon. 

We are committed to supporting the uptake of ultra low carbon vehicles in the United Kingdom. 

The Government has made provision of over £400 million to support the development of the ultra low emission vehicle market work to 2015. This includes funding;

  * for recharging infrastructure schemes,
  * to promote the uptake of ultra-low emission vehicles through the Plug-In Car and Van Grants and 
  * £82 million of support for research and development

In addition UKH2Mobility was launched in January. This joint undertaking with key industry stakeholders will evaluate the potential for hydrogen as a fuel for Ultra Low Carbon Vehicles in the UK.

We are also backing a revolution in bus travel with a multi-million pound Green Bus Fund - a scheme that has helped to deliver more than 500 low carbon buses on routes across England. And, notably, much of this work has been done by UK companies.

To conclude…generating economic growth and cutting carbon emissions are not mutually exclusive - they are two sides of the same coin. 

This is particularly true of the biofuels industry which has become an important part of the UK economy, of our national infrastructure and our efforts to meet international emission and energy targets. 

To get the best result for the consumer, the environment and the taxpayer we will continue to work closely with industry in addressing barriers to supplying sustainable biofuel in the transport sector. This is why Networks such as yours are so important in providing a forum to develop and share knowledge.

We will also continue to ensure that the full consequences of growing biofuels are considered and assessed. This is essential if Government is to provide a clear policy framework which encourages growth. 

I know that, at the EU level there is work to do on issues such as ILUC. But I am confident that, together, we have made some significant progress towards assuring that biofuels used in the UK are sustainable. 

It just remains to thank you for listening and wish you a productive and enjoyable day.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/plug-in-car-grant,208,"Since January 2011, motorists purchasing a qualifying ultra-low emission car have been able to receive a grant of 25 per cent towards the cost of the vehicle, up to a maximum of £5,000. The 2010 Spending Review confirmed that Government has made provision to support the Plug-in Car Grant for the life of this Parliament. Both private consumers and businesses can benefit from the Plug-in Car Grant when purchasing a qualifying ultra-low emission car and registering it in the UK. The grant is only available on first registrations, with registration defined as falling under the [Vehicle Excise and Registration Act](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/all?title=vehicle%20excise%20and%20registration%20act) 1994. In addition, the grant can only be administered for a specific vehicle once.

The Government is adopting a technology neutral approach to reducing emissions from transport. This means that all cars that meet the criteria set out below are potentially eligible for the Grant. This includes, but is not limited to, electric, plug-in hybrid and hydrogen-fuelled cars. However, consumers will find that hydrogen vehicles are, as yet, less available on the open market than electric and plug-in hybrid options.

The Plug-in Car Grant has been designed to help make the whole-life costs of a qualifying car more comparable with petrol or diesel equivalents. Over time, as manufacturers begin to make these cars in greater volumes, the costs of production should begin to fall. This will help to make an ultra-low carbon car a realistic option for anyone looking to buy a car.

The Grant is not designed to support research and development projects: any funding for this would be delivered by the Technology Strategy Board.

The cars eligible for the Plug-in Car Grant are:

  * [Chevrolet Volt](http://www.chevrolet.co.uk/experience-chevrolet/news/2010/news/news-details2010-33.html)
  * [Citroen CZero](http://www.citroen.co.uk/home/#/new-cars/car-range/citroen-c-zero/)

As of 30 September 2012, 2,311 claims have been made through the Plug-in Car Grant scheme.

## 1. Car eligibility

To be eligible for the Grant, applicants need to demonstrate that their completed vehicle (chassis and bodywork) has type approval or Individual Vehicle Approval and meets the Grant criteria. These criteria have been set to ensure that vehicles meet an agreed level of performance and safety.

## 2. Multi-stage builds

To qualify for the Plug-In Car Grant any multi-stage built M1 vehicle will need to have been approved as a completed vehicle (e.g. comprising both chassis and bodywork): the accepted evidence listed above must cover the vehicle in its finished condition. An approval for a vehicle that has not been completed will not be accepted. This is to ensure vehicles driven off the forecourt when bought by the public meet the Plug-In Car Grant criteria.

Manufacturers will need to consult the Vehicle Certification Agency (VCA) to obtain completed vehicle approval

  * [Type approval for goods vehicles](http://www.dft.gov.uk/vca/vehicletype/type-approval-for-go.asp)
  * [European Community whole vehicle type approval (ECWVTA)](http://www.dft.gov.uk/vca/vehicletype/ecwvta-framework-directive.asp)

To make an enquiry about applying for type approval, email enquiries@vca.gov.uk or call +44 (0)117 952 4164.

## 3. Criteria

3.1. Vehicle type: Only new cars are eligible (vehicle category 'M1′). This includes pre-registration conversions (normal, internal combustion engine cars that were converted to battery or hybrid versions by specialist convertors before the car's first registration). Motorbikes and quadricycles are not covered.

3.2. Crash Test: These vehicles must either have EC whole vehicle type approval (EC WVTA) Or if Small series approval is granted, evidence must be supplied to show that the car has appropriate levels of safety, as judged by international standards.

3.3. Carbon dioxide exhaust emissions: Vehicles must emit less than 75 grams of carbon dioxide (CO2) per kilometre driven.

## 4. Frequently asked questions

i. I am thinking about buying a qualifying car - how do I apply for the Grant?  
If you are looking to use the Plug-in Car Grant to purchase an eligible car, the good news is that there are no application forms to fill in. The dealership or vendor you are buying your car from will complete all the paperwork on your behalf as you buy the car; and the amount of your Grant will be automatically deducted from the price of your car at the point of purchase.

Before you purchase your car, the dealer will ask you a few questions about your decision to purchase an ultra-low emission vehicle. This data will help inform policy decisions about ultra-low emission cars and supporting infrastructure.

ii. How do I know which vehicles are eligible for the Grant?  
The list above shows which vehicles are eligible and this will be updated when more cars enter the scheme. These vehicles meet all the criteria.

iii. I am a vehicle manufacturer looking to see whether a model is eligible for subsidy under the terms of the scheme. How do I apply for Plug-in Car Grant eligibility?  
Vehicle manufacturers who want to apply for their vehicle model to be eligible for subsidy under the scheme will need to make a formal application. To do this, you will require an application pack and associated guidance. You can request this from [olev.enquiries@olev.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:olev.enquiries@olev.gsi.gov.uk). The guidance document will give you more detail about how to provide evidence that you meet each criterion, including examples of acceptable evidence.

iv. I am a vehicle importer looking to import and sell eligible vehicles in the UK. How do I apply for Plug-in Car Grant eligibility?  
Importers also need to demonstrate the vehicles they will import and sell meet the Grant criteria. To do this, you will require an application pack and associated guidance. You can request this from [olev.enquiries@olev.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:olev.enquiries@olev.gsi.gov.uk). For example, you will need to submit information on the measures you have taken to mitigate electrical safety risks and the warranty that you will provide with the vehicles that you intend to sell.

v. What about vehicles that have been converted?  
The Grant is for new cars and vans at first registration in the UK. Pre-registration conversions are eligible to be submitted for the scheme however, post-registration conversions are not.

## Notice

Research October 2012 - Please note, the Department has commissioned the independent research company TNS-BMRB to conduct research to explore existing Grant recipients' views and experiences of owning and using electric cars.

The grant provides purchasers with up to £8,000 off the cost of an eligible van. This short film provides information about the grant, and shows people's reactions to the event.

## Transcript

**Voiceover:** The Government is committed to the development of ultra-low emission vehicles and, to encourage businesses to invest in plug-in vans, the Secretary of State launched the new Plug-In Van Grant, at an event held at County Hall in London. 

**Justine Greening:** Well, we're announcing the plugged-in vans grant. That's saying that you can get up to 20% or up to £8,000 of grant towards buying a electric van or a hybrid van, and that should really help start to drive that switch from polluting diesel vans to more cleaner, greener hybrid and electric vans.

It's really important because we know that one of the key drivers of emissions in the UK, of course, is road transport, and particularly cars and vans, so if we can start to get that switch on to more ultra-low emission vehicles then that's really going to help us meet our targets.

**Pete Waterman:** The cost of diesel now is huge. So if you're going to save money - and, you know, being… you know, all this 'worried about the pound in my pocket', particularly as you get older; as you know, money becomes, you know, important to you - I think that, you know, is a viable option.

**Justine Greening:** Of course, for businesses it can make business sense too, because anybody who has filled up their van or their car with petrol or diesel recently knows just how expensive it is, so actually we're going to not just help the environment - this is about helping business too.

**Paul Everitt:** Ultra-low carbon vehicles are very much the future of the industry. We expect to see a transition to this type of technology over the coming years, and it's very important not just to meet our environmental challenges and targets, but also our industrial ambitions.

**Dan Taylor:** We've got a really big fleet - we've got the third largest fleet in the UK with around 12,000 vans - so for us it's really important that we look at all the options to make our fleet as green as possible and obviously as cost-efficient as possible. And with today's announcement around the grant, absolutely, it's beginning to stack up in terms of the numbers.

We've got a mission over the next 10 years to reduce our carbon footprint, and transport's going to be a massive part of that, so we've really got to decarbonise our transport. That's going to add up financially and economically, but also from the environmental perspective, we don't have a lot of choice to make this work. So we're proud to be leading the way, and as I say, we've got 150 vehicles to be on the road by the end of next year.

**Justine Greening:** What it shows is that business is starting to look seriously about how it can green its fleet. We know that's incredibly important; it's one of the reasons why the Plugged-in Places investment has really focused on the workplace - that's where people have their car and it can charge up whilst they're there. So business is really, really important, whether you're working at business or whether you're running a fleet, and that's one of the reasons why we're delighted that British Gas is, in a sense, leading the way.

**Richard Deslandes:** Each individual electric vehicle has its place, whether it's a 3.5 tonner or whether it's the inner city runaround like our own. I think they all have their place and we're all going to benefit from this… these initiatives.

**Paul Everitt:** We've got a number of products here that are produced in the UK; a number of the others also have technology that is being developed and manufactured here in the UK. So if we want to compete globally on the types of vehicles that we are going to be producing in the future, it's essential that we create a supply chain for those technologies here in the UK. And so the grant is part of that strategy. It persuades people that the UK's a good place to develop this technology, to demonstrate it, but in the long term hopefully manufacture it, and export it to other places around the world.

**Richard Deslandes:** I think that the electric van incentive is actually an essential part of developing electric strategy in a city, public utility companies, and so on and so forth, need this kind of boost. 

**Paul Everitt:** For us this is a very important step. We hope to see a significant take-up of the grant over the course of the next well, not just this year but over the course of the next three to five years. And as we get that, and we build volume in the marketplace, then we will see the technology both improve but also reduce in cost.

**Dan Taylor:** I think, the grant that's announced today, together with some of the additional benefits, things like the congestion charging, et cetera, in London, really begin to help make the case stack up. So we're fully behind it.

**Richard Deslandes:** What is interesting is that continental Europe looks with certainly slightly green eyes at the UK, where there is, I think, a serious level of joined-up thinking; whether it comes from OLEV, or whether it comes from the EV Group at the SMMT, whether it comes from plugged-in places, whether it comes from the Mayor's initiatives, I think there's some serious joined-up thinking in the UK which the rest of the Europe would do very well to emulate.

## Background information

Rail passenger kilometres totals are published quarterly by the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR). The rail industry's central ticketing system, LENNON, is the basis for passenger kilometres data. LENNON holds information on the vast majority of national rail tickets purchased in Great Britain and is used to allocate the revenue from ticket sales between train operating companies.

ORR also receives quarterly non-LENNON kilometres data from train operators. Non-LENNON data are information not recorded within the LENNON system such as operator specific tickets and Passenger Transport Executive (PTE) multi-modal tickets.

The statistics are converted from kilometres to miles by DfT for the purposes of this publication.

The data supplied in the table and the charts refer to financial rather than calendar years.

  * **Publishing schedule:** Quarterly

## Transcript

Thank you for inviting me to give the keynote address at this year's National Highways and Transport Network Conference. I am also pleased that the Highways Maintenance Efficiency Programme is helping support this annual conference for the second year.

First let me say that I am very sorry I can't be with you in person, but I am glad that I can be virtually with you at least.

I am always interested in what the National Highways and Transport Network Surveys results reveal about what the public actually think about the various aspect of transport in their local areas. I understand that 75 local authorities subscribed to this year's survey and, given the total number of interviews in each area, this represents a significant insight into public perception.

As the Minister with particular responsibility for local transport, how we respond and accommodate local needs is something at the very heart of what I am involved in day-to-day.

The Coalition Government has placed Localism at the centre of its plans. I am pleased to say that we have made considerable progress. This has included the Localism Bill passing through Parliament and now becoming the Localism Act.

However, responding to local needs is about far more than an Act of Parliament. So let me say something about how this is working in the Department for Transport. 

Firstly, our future plans for rail will give local areas more say on their rail services, including a mechanism for local transport bodies, working with the industry, to more easily sponsor additional local services.

I have published our proposals for devolving the funding we provide for local major schemes to local transport bodies that comprise local authorities and local business, through local economic partnerships, working together.

Of course our capital funding via both the Integrated Transport block and the Highway Maintenance block is already effectively devolved. This is because what local authorities get is based on established formulae, and the recipients have autonomy in how they use the funds, allowing them to better respond to local needs and priorities.

The Local Sustainable Transport Fund has provided a large number of local authorities, often working together, with £600 million for schemes that create growth and cut carbon at the local level. I am particularly pleased with the wide range of proposals we were able to support, and local councils have come up with imaginative and innovative proposals. Yes, there was competition for the available funding pot, but as many of you know we received applications involving every eligible local authority in England.

The Government is playing its part in setting out some high level messages supporting sustainable transport and especially cycling, whilst leaving the detail and delivery very much to be determined at the local level.

The nationwide campaign for road safety has for some years now been based around the THINK branding. I am pleased to say that because of the general upsurge in cycling in recent times - not least because of Team GB's success in the Olympics - we have recently announced a new THINKCYCLIST campaign. The key message is that drivers and cyclists actually have more in common than is often realised. The campaign is therefore about both groups of road users being aware of each other.

The Coalition Government recognises that well maintained national and local highways are important to the economy, to all road users and to local residents. 

Despite the difficult economic situation we inherited we are providing over £3 billion to councils across England for local road maintenance between 2011 and 2015.

Now I know there is significant scope for many local authorities to change their approach, to emulate the best practice to be found in well-performing authorities, to find efficiencies and to achieve more from their spending on local roads.

In these tight fiscal times, we must all - central and local government alike - use resources much more efficiently to get the best value for money for the taxpayer. 

There are over 150 different highway authorities, very often doing things in quite different ways. It is clear that councils can learn from each other and get more for less. 

This is one of the reasons why I launched the Highways Maintenance Efficiency Programme in April 2011 - a £6 million initiative running until 2018 to improve efficiencies and maximise returns on investment in highways maintenance. 

One of the Programme's key hallmarks is that it is sector-led. So, working in partnership it is for local highway authorities and the providers of maintenance services, many of which are from the private sector, to determine the programme's scope and shape its content. 

It's also an initiative rooted in this Government's commitment to localism, devolution and empowerment. 

I am pleased that the Programme's work is now well underway and products like the Local Highway Authority Collaborative Alliance Toolkit have recently been launched. It is already being used by several potential groups of local authorities to form their own alliances.

I understand that several further tools covering Asset Management and Standardisation of Contracts & Specification are due to be launched this autumn, with others in line for user testing.

I was also pleased to see that the Final Report of the Pothole Review was published in April and that its recommendations got a good reception. The programme has now put in place an implementation Plan to ensure its recommendations are delivered.

I would like to pick up on the Customer, Quality and Cost work being done within the National Highways and Transport Network. 

In my view the local authorities responsible for highway maintenance can better respond to local needs in their area, if they have a full picture of all three dimensions. These are:

Firstly, customer perceptions - as revealed by for instance the National Highways and Transport Network survey;

Secondly, quality - the technical quality of carriageways and footways as revealed by the detailed surveys undertaken by highway authorities;

And thirdly, cost - as reflected in the resources spent on maintenance.

Whilst this approach is currently being refined by the National Highways and Transport Network for highways maintenance, the concept may prove equally useful for other aspects of transport such as cycling, walking and road safety.

In conclusion, it is clear to me that work the National Highways and Transport Network undertakes, especially making information on local transport available to local people, is very important. The National Highways and Transport Network both elicits the Customer's Perception, and also makes it available 'warts and all' to everyone. This is in keeping with the Coalition Government's policy to increase transparency within all levels of government and throughout the public sector. And having the information widely available allows for analysis and continuous improvement in the outputs and outcomes.

So thank you for listening and I trust you all have an interesting and successful day.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/security-of-dangerous-goods-by-road-and-rail,216,"## Introduction

Businesses involved in the carriage of dangerous goods by road and rail for national and international journeys are required to take security measures to safeguard against acts of terrorism in accordance with chapter 1.10 of the [European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR)](http://www.unece.org/trans/danger/publi/adr/adr_e.html) and of the [Appendix C of the Convention concerning International Carriage by Rail](http://www.otif.org/en/publications/rid-2011.html), Regulations concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Rail (RID).

## The requirements

Regulation 5 of the [Carriage of Dangerous Goods and Use of Transportable Pressure Equipment Regulations 2009](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2009/1348/contents/made) (and as amended) apply the security provisions of ADR and RID for national journeys. Regulations 7 and 8 also contain additional security requirements for Great Britain. These Regulations are subject to agreed derogations as set out in the [Carriage of Dangerous Goods: Approved Derogations and Transitional Provisions](http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/cdg-approved-derogations-and-transitional-provisions/).

The security requirements are split between two levels. A general level is applicable to all dangerous goods and requires that they shall only be offered to people, companies or organisations that have been appropriately identified, temporary storage sites shall be properly secured, drivers shall carry a means of photographic identification and security training awareness shall be provided. A higher level applies for high consequence dangerous goods and requires that a security plan is adopted, implemented and complied with. High consequence dangerous goods are defined as those which have the potential for misuse in a terrorist incident and which may, as a result, produce serious consequences such as mass casualties or mass destruction.

The requirements do not apply to the carriage of civil nuclear material as defined by the Nuclear Industries Security Regulations 2003 (NISR). The transport of such material and non nuclear radioactive material is regulated by the [Office for Nuclear Regulation](http://www.hse.gov.uk/nuclear/transport/index.htm) in accordance with NISR.

### Road and rail guidance documents

The Department for Transport (DfT) published guidance when the security requirements originally came into force in July 2005 to help you determine which measures you should apply in order to comply with the security requirements. This guidance is currently being reviewed and updated and will appear here in the near future. If in the mean time you have any enquiries regarding the security requirements please contact the Department using the contact details below.

Thank you for inviting me to speak today.

And while I cannot be with you in person, it seems rather apt for me to appear in virtual form, as your conference examines how evolving technologies might be harnessed to create a smarter city. 

For me, this theme chimes very closely with an important element of the work I have been driving forward during my time in Government: developing a transport system that creates growth and reduces carbon emissions by maximising the role technology plays in changing the way we work and live. 

The growth of cities has historically been driven by industrial advancements - new engineering techniques, increased transport capability, global business expansion. As our cities sprawled, we responded by building more homes and expanding our transport networks to widen the geographical reach of our economic centres.

Travel to work areas stretched, and it is now common for someone to live over an hour, or even two hours, from where they work. This comes with inevitable costs to the environment and employee wellbeing, not to mention the impact on congestion. 

So we are now taking a step back. We're looking at the shape of the world we've created, and we're considering 'what next'? What will be the next iteration of the 'modern city'? And how can the UK remain at the forefront of that evolution? People cannot keep travelling further and further, and they most certainly cannot do so while confined by the working hours that tradition, and habit, so often dictate. 

That is why the Department for Transport is looking for smart solutions to the traditional problems we've faced. Solutions that are low-cost and high-reward. Solutions that help us deliver what we need to, while also ensuring minimal negative impact on the end user. 

Our biggest city has just shown us what is possible. During this great summer, it wasn't just the sport that was a major achievement: our already busy transport network in London stood up to an influx of around one million extra daily visitors. 

But it wasn't just an increase in transport provision that made the Olympics and Paralympics a success. It was also behaviour change. People listened to our messages on the expected demand increase. They thought about how they usually travel. And they adopted changes to make their journeys more enjoyable. 

For some people it may have been flexing the hours they worked, or changing their route to avoid the busiest places at the busiest times. For others, it was perhaps walking or cycling part or all of the way.

Still others embraced technology. They replaced face-to-face meetings with teleconferences and videoconferences. They worked from unaffected locations, such as an office hub or home. 

This exemplifies the way technology is changing the way we live and work. And it is Expos like this that are at the forefront of the revolution. Telecommunications have become an inextricable part of our offices. Videoconferencing and teleconferencing are becoming commonplace, and working whilst on the move is now the norm.

So now we are left asking: why can't every day be like it was during the Games? And the truth is: it can. 

We've already seen some excellent thinking around the city of the future. A recent paper by Microsoft comes to mind, a white paper on the Anywhere Working City. It introduced the concept of a 'third space' - a space between the office and the home where people can connect via technology. Global Action Plan's 'Business in Motion' paper examined how technology could reduce our impact on the environment. And Business in the Community's ways2work campaign connects business leaders with best practice on how businesses can reduce their impact on the transport network. 

**These kinds of sector-led initiatives will surely continue. But where does Government fit in?**

For us in the Department for Transport, the priority is integrated infrastructure.

That is why Government is looking at door-to-door journeys. What does a person need to make their journey from door-to-door both seamless and convenient? What can we do to facilitate and enable that journey? Is it technology? Is it better transport facilities? We are working closely with industry and key stakeholders to develop a strategy that will set the scene for door-to-door journeys into the future. This will enable others to deliver a well-connected, smart and sustainable transport system that works for everyone.

The smart ticketing technology that we are investing in has the potential to transform the way that passengers think about and pay for travel on public transport. As part of our Rail Fares & Ticketing review, we are looking at how we can use smart ticketing to offer innovative and new ticket types that reflect modern working patterns. 

It's also why we're supporting the transition to ultra-low emission vehicles. Yes, we are committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 50 per cent from 1990 levels between 2023 to 2027. But we also recognise that people care about the climate.

So we offer a Plug-in Car Grant and a Plug-in Van Grant to stimulate the market, and help with the upfront costs for those motorists choosing to purchase these ultra-low emission vehicles. We have also committed up to £30m of match-funding to the Plugged-In Places Programme, supporting the development of plug-in vehicle recharging infrastructure. 

And we continue to look at the bigger picture. Through our £600m Local Sustainable Transport Fund, we asked local authorities to look at sustainable transport within their communities, and consider what would be needed to help create growth and cut carbon.

Within central Government, we will look at our own internal processes, and consider how we can work better. We will take the lessons we have learned throughout the Games, and identify opportunities for long-term change, to maximise efficiency, increase business resilience, and provide the best possible service to the taxpayer.

Because, ultimately, that is what a Smart City is. It's a city that provides a high quality, integrated, and joined-up experience for those living within it. And I look forward to continuing to play a role in delivering that end goal.

Thank you.

A summary of the research that DfT has undertaken from past to present on the modelling and appraisal of travel time variability (reliability). This is mostly for highway modelling, but has some elements of rail reliability also. This provides clarity on the position we're at regarding research. This is a complex area for appraisal, particularly given the importance of reliability, that we need to better understand in order to potentially integrate into our modelling tools and appraisal system.

The Traffic Commissioners (""TCs"") are appointed by the Secretary of State. They are statutorily independent and their main function is to administer the goods and public service vehicle operator licensing systems. There is a statutory requirement for each TC to submit an annual report to the Secretary of State on their activities during the year. Although the Government is under no legal obligation to publish them, in the interest of transparency it has always done so, alongside an overview by the Senior Traffic Commissioner and detailed statistical information (on number of applications processed etc).

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/ten-t-programme,220,"## Summary

The Trans European Network - Transport (TEN-T) Programme exists to support the development of the single market by providing funding for transport infrastructure projects on a set of defined networks. The network covers all modes:

  * major road (motorways and some trunk roads) and rail routes
  * significant airports
  * ports
  * inter-modal terminals
  * traffic management systems covering the air, road, rail and inland waterways

The [TEN-T Guidelines](http://ec.europa.eu/transport/themes/infrastructure/ten-t-policy/legal-basis/guidelines_en.htm) contain the maps which define the network. The policy for the programme is set by the European Commission's [Directorate General for Mobility and Transport](http://ec.europa.eu/transport/index_en.htm) (DG MOVE). The Programme is managed by the [Trans-European Transport Network Executive Agency](http://tentea.ec.europa.eu/) (TEN-T EA).

### Financial support from the TEN-T programme

Financial support from the TEN-T programme is available to both studies and works-based projects. It acts as a stimulus for infrastructure projects, it is not a subsidy.  
The current budget runs from 2007 to 2013 and amounts to €8 billion. Funding is allocated through two mechanisms:

  * Multi-Annual Work Programme for complex priority projects that may require regular support (80% of the total budget)
  * Annual Work Programme for one off projects (20% of the total budget)

Nearly €7 billion of the budget was committed to priority projects through the Multi-Annual Work Programme at the start of the programme in 2007.

### Applying for TEN-T support

Calls for funding under the different mechanisms are usually done on an annual basis with each call having a particular set of criteria that projects must meet in order to be eligible for funding. Information on calls for funding can be found on the [TEN-T EA web site](http://tentea.ec.europa.eu/en/apply_for_funding/follow_the_funding_process/calls_for_proposals_2010.htm). Projects are subject to external evaluation to ensure that they meet the criteria for the call and are scored in several areas (including maturity, relevance to TEN-T objectives, impact of the project on the network and the environment and the quality of the project).

The Department for Transport's Trans-European Network team coordinate the bidding process for UK applications. All proposed bids for support must be in line with UK transport policy and have policy clearance from the relevant DfT modal policy division or Devolved Administration.

In order be considered for funding applicants must be able to demonstrate that their project is:

  * Mature and well developed with costs and timetables established and management and planning in place;
  * Adds value to the development of the European TEN-T network.

The level of funding is variable depending on the type of projects. Studies can receive up to 50% of eligible costs, cross border projects 30%, priority projects 20% and projects that are not on the priority network can get up to 10%.

### Successful Awards

Since the creation of the programme in 1996 the department has helped a large number of projects to obtain funding.

### TEN-T Policy Review

The European Commission has initiated a review of the TEN-T policy. The TEN-T Green Paper, launched in February 2009, was the first stage in this process. The Commission published their draft for a [new TEN-T Regulation](http://ec.europa.eu/transport/themes/infrastructure/revision-t_en.htm) in October 2011 to be taken forward under the Co-decision process by the European Council and European Parliament (EP). The Council agreed a General Approach on the draft Regulation at the March 2012 Transport Council. The EP is scheduled to vote on the draft Regulation at their Plenary in January 2013.  
A new finance Regulation for TEN-T, the [Connecting Europe Facility (CEF)](http://ec.europa.eu/transport/themes/infrastructure/connecting_en.htm), was also published by the European Commission in October 2011. This will also be taken through the Co-decision process. This will cover all the TENs workstreams - Transport, Energy and Telecoms. A Partial General Approach (PGA) was agreed at the June 2012 Transport Council and the EP is scheduled to vote on this draft Regulation at their Plenary in January 2013.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/think-cyclist,221,"THINK CYCLIST is a new communications campaign to help reduce the number of pedal cyclists who are killed and seriously injured on the roads by informing cyclists and motorists of the steps they can take to avoid collisions.

[DfT's road casualty statistics](http://www.dft.gov.uk/statistics/releases/reported-road-casualties-gb-main-results-2011) show that in 2011:

  * The number of pedal cyclists killed fell by 4 per cent from 111 in 2010 to 107 in 2011.
  * The total number of casualties reported to the police as seriously injured in a road accident increased by 16 per cent to 3,085. Total reported casualties among pedal cyclists also rose, by 12 per cent, compared to 2010. Pedal cyclist traffic levels are estimated to have risen by 2.2 per cent over the same period.
  * 92 per cent of reported cyclists killed or seriously injured (KSI) occurred in accidents involving another vehicle (usually a car).
  * The most common contributory factor to accidents involving cyclists and drivers recorded by police officers at the accident scene is that one or both participants 'looked but failed to see'.

The strategic focus for the THINK CYCLIST campaign is to encourage drivers and cyclists to look out for each other by giving road safety advice. The campaign has two main premises:

  * Cyclists and drivers share many similarities, including the fact that large numbers fall into both groups with 80 per cent of cyclists holding a driving licence and 20 per cent of drivers cycling at least once a month.
  * Visibility is essential to good road safety.

## Campaign messages

The overall campaign message is 'Let's look out for each other'.

The supporting messages of the campaign are:

When you're driving

  1. Look out for cyclists, especially when turning - make eye contact if possible so they know you've seen them
  2. Use your indicators - signal your intentions so that cyclists can react
  3. Give cyclists space - at least half a car's width. If there isn't sufficient space to pass, hold back. Remember that cyclists may need to manoeuvre suddenly if the road is poor, it's windy or if a car door is opened
  4. Always check for cyclists when you open your car door
  5. Avoid driving over advanced stop lines - these allow cyclists to get to the front and increase their visibility
  6. Follow the Highway Code including 'stop' and 'give way' signs and traffic lights

When you're cycling

  1. Ride positively, decisively and well clear of the kerb - look and signal to show drivers what you plan to do and make eye contact where possible so you know drivers have seen you
  2. Avoid riding up the inside of large vehicles, like lorries or buses, where you might not be seen
  3. Always use lights after dark or when visibility is poor
  4. Wearing light coloured or reflective clothing during the day and reflective clothing and/or accessories in the dark increases your visibility
  5. Follow the Highway Code including observing 'stop' and 'give way' signs and traffic lights
  6. THINK! recommends wearing a correctly fitted cycle helmet, which is securely fastened and conforms to current regulations

## Campaign activity

This first THINK CYCLIST activity is a month-long PR campaign to communicate cycling safety advice to drivers and cyclists through coverage in local, national and online media.

The campaign seeks to attract media coverage from national and regional news media as a means to promote awareness of the campaign messages.

The campaign is the first stage in building long term relationships between THINK CYCLIST and organisations including those involved with motoring, cycling and local safety. The objective is to work in partnership to deliver cycling safety messages to drivers and cyclists, through trusted organisations.

A 'stakeholder toolkit' is available for stakeholders to download. This includes key messages and creative assets to encourage organisations to use THINK CYCLIST messages in their own cycle safety campaigns.

Well I'm here this morning to help launch the Department's campaign on cycle safety. It's a THINK! Campaign, because over the past four years we've seen more and more people quite rightly wanting to get on their bikes and get cycling. And unfortunately we have seen a rise also in people injured in accidents. 

And what I'm doing today is launching a campaign, which says to people, drivers and cyclists, are not two different beings, not two different worlds. Most people, a lot of people, who cycle drive, a lot of people who drive cycle as well. What I'm saying to them is think about some of the very basic things you could do that would increase the safety on the roads for everyone.

If you're a driver for instance, first of all make sure when you turn left you look, make sure you're signalling is done nice and early as possible, so people have that clear intent. When you coming to traffic lights, observe the space in front of you for cyclists, so that their visibility is increased. 

And when you're a cyclist, look out for what cars are doing, but also make sure it's clear if your, as you're going to undertake that there's good width between you and the car. I'm asking car driver to also ook at the distance between it and the cyclist.

After the Olympics and after the Paralympics, I think we're going to see, already people are saying to me they want to get out and cycle. We've seen people report that there are more people out there cycling. And I think after that success, more and more people are going to be cycling and I wanted to launch this campaign as soon as we could after the Olympics to make sure that capturing all the success, more people wanting to cycle, that they cycle safely.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/traffic-signals-low-demand-periods,224,"## Summary

Traffic signal design is a science that has been developed through decades to a point where the maximum efficiency can be squeezed out of the most congested of junctions. Conflicting needs of all road users are measured, evaluated and optimised such that the ever-increasing and varying demands continue to be managed with ingenuity and perfection.

But roads aren't always busy. In many cases the very justification for signal control is based on a problem that may only exist for a couple of hours each weekday. Even the most congested networks have their quiet moment, yet, in a deserted city at 3 in the morning, signals still cycle for non-existent traffic. Any driver who ventures into this scenario may sit in frustration at a red light while the 'intelligent' control system optimises the signals for phantom conflicting demands.

In other countries various techniques are applied to 'demote' signalised junctions to priority mode of operation, for example the flashing amber on main road/flashing red on minor road employed in some States of the USA, or signals that simply turn off overnight as in parts of Europe.

The Department for Transport commissioned a desktop study to investigate options for signal controlled installations that could

  * reduce unnecessary delays to traffic, hence minimising overall vehicle delays and emissions;
  * reduce the energy consumption of signal installations; and
  * maintain or enhance levels of safety, especially for vulnerable road users.

The study reviewed current practice in the UK and overseas, developed an assessment technique to identify the types of installation that may be suitable for an alternative low-demand strategy during periods of low demand and in liaison with 12 Local Authorities devised 25 potential control strategy options to meet the objectives. These options were then modelled on a small hypothetical VISSIM network, enabling assessment on factors relating to economy, environment, safety, legislation and design, and classified according to their potential for implementation - short, medium or long term - depending upon factors such as required changes to legislation, technology or driver comprehension.

The findings were notable - the options offering most benefit during low demand periods were also the most difficult to implement. However there are opportunities for embracing developing technologies and making minor changes to installation parameters that could reduce installation and maintenance costs and improve the efficiency of LD methods of operation that retain signal control and its intrinsic safety compared with priority operation. The outcome of the research commissioned by the Department for Transport on options for signalling in periods of low demand are presented in this report.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/unadopted-roads,226,"## Summary

'Unadopted' roads are those roads not maintained by a highway authority as defined by Highways Act 1980. The description of such roads covers a wide range of circumstances.

For most unadopted residential roads the duty to maintain it falls to the frontagers, ie the owners of the property fronting that road, which may include those where the side, or length, of their property fronts the unadopted road. Those buying property on an unadopted street should be made aware of the situation regarding their property and their related liability for the road. Under Highways Act 1980, local highway authorities may adopt streets that they are not currently responsible for maintaining, but this is purely a matter for local decision.

In respect of roads on planned new residential developments a Working Group of representatives from central and local government has developed this set of draft planning conditions. These draft conditions have been created to assist in preparing such roads for adoption by local highway authorities with the aim of protecting the interests of new residents. Local highway and planning authorities may wish to consider where / if the use of these draft planning conditions are appropriate. Where the conditions are used, feedback about authorities' experiences of working with them would be welcome. A response form has be included within Addendum A at the end of the draft document.
