http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/baker-20110119,1,"**Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Norman Baker):** Mr. Speaker, with your permission I should like to make a statement to accompany the publication today of the Coalition Government's White Paper on Local Transport, and the simultaneous publication of bidding guidance to accompany our new 'Local Sustainable Transport Fund'.  Both documents are available to colleagues in the vote office and have been placed in the library of the house.

This Government's vision is for a transport system that helps create growth in the economy, and tackles climate change by cutting our carbon emissions.

The launch of this White Paper, and the associated Local Sustainable Transport Fund, represents a significant step towards meeting these two key government objectives.

In both the Budget and the Spending Review, the Chancellor pledged to make the tough choices that will allow us to maintain investment in new and existing infrastructure to support a growing economy, while eliminating the structural deficit over the lifetime of the Parliament.

The Spending Review reflected transport's vital role in this: I am pleased that we were able to secure significant investment to allow us to go ahead with important transport initiatives. The investment we have committed to in rail, low carbon vehicles and public and sustainable transport reflects the determination to secure growth while cutting carbon.

In the medium term, our transport decarbonisation strategy centres around the progressive electrification of the passenger car fleet, supported by policies to increase generation capacity and decarbonise the grid. By also prioritising spending on key rail projects such as high speed rail and rail electrification, we will be providing travellers with attractive new options instead of the plane and car.

In the immediate term, addressing shorter, local trips offers huge potential in helping to grow the economy and tackle climate change. Shorter trips are important - two-thirds of all journeys are under five miles. Walking, cycling and public transport are all real, greener alternatives for such trips.

What's more, we know that people who travel to the shops on foot, by bicycle or by public transport can spend more per head than those who travel by car - and research shows that improvements to the public realm can increase turnover in the high street by 5 to 15%. Increased sustainable travel also helps tackle congestion, which is a drag on business causing excess delays in urban areas at a cost of around £11 billion per annum.

And let us not forget the further benefits that follow a shift to more sustainable transport - benefits to the air we breathe, to our levels of fitness, and the money in our pockets as well.  Investment in sustainable transport helps make our towns and cities healthier and more attractive places to live, work and shop.

This White Paper sets out how we can encourage the uptake of more sustainable modes at local level, and the unprecedented £560 million we have allocated in our new 'Local Sustainable Transport Fund' will support this. Our commitment to helping local authorities with this vital agenda is reaffirmed by the amount of money we are making available.

The Local Sustainable Transport Fund forms part of a wider picture of more streamlined and simplified funding to local authorities. This will give local authorities more power and flexibility to meet local transport needs.

Across Government we have demonstrated our commitment to ending the top-down decision making, and the tendency in Whitehall to develop one-size-fits-all solutions which ignore the specific needs and behaviour patterns of local communities.

The Government has already taken significant steps to hand back power to local communities. These include replacing Regional Development Agencies with Local Enterprise Partnerships, giving communities a much greater say over planning decisions and ending the top-down imposition of housing targets.

Today's White Paper is about extending the decentralisation of power to local transport, putting into context what this means for local authorities.

We are particularly keen to receive bids for the Local Sustainable Transport Fund from local authorities who are in partnership with the voluntary, community and social enterprise sector, and have the support of local businesses. We believe that by encouraging bids in this way, we will be able to capture innovative solutions to local transport needs in all areas, rural and urban.

An example I often quote is the Cuckmere Community Bus in my own constituency. Individual residents in the Cuckmere Valley have come together to run regular and frequent bus services, taking people in rural areas to their nearest towns.  These services are provided entirely by volunteers.

'Wheels to Work' schemes provide transport to people who are unable to access training, employment or education, due to a lack of suitable public or private transport.  Schemes can, therefore, particularly benefit people living in isolated rural communities and can play an important part in helping people to come off benefits and regain their independence.

These are real examples, happening right now, and we want to enable similar stories to unfold in other areas across the country.  
In addition, we also recognise that there are some initiatives that benefit from a single national approach.

These include:

  * providing £11m funding for Bikeability cycle training next year, to allow 275,000 ten to eleven-year-olds to benefit from 'on-road' cycle training.  And a commitment to support Bikeability for the duration of this parliament, which will allow as many children as possible to undertake high quality cycle training;
  * improving end-to-end journeys by encouraging transport operators, and those involved in promoting cycling and car clubs or sharing, to work together, to provide better information and integrate tickets and timetables;
  * delivering, with operators and public sector bodies, the infrastructure to enable most local public transport journeys to be undertaken using smart ticketing by December 2014. We will work with the transport industry to support the development of e-purses and other technology related to smart ticketing and support the infrastructure to make this happen;
  * reviewing the way in which transport investment decisions are made to ensure that the carbon implications are fully recognised;
  * transferring responsibility for local roads classification to local authorities, giving them the flexibility to determine the status of their roads;
  * setting out in a strategic framework for road safety, by spring 2011, how to ensure that Britain's roads are among the world's safest;
  * modernising traffic signs policy so as to provide more flexibility and reduced costs and bureaucracy for local authorities to enable them to develop innovative traffic management solutions.

Mr Speaker, we want to build a transport system that is an engine for economic growth but one that is also greener. 

One that creates growth and cuts carbon.

By improving the links that move goods and people around, encouraging people to travel sustainably, and targeting investment in new projects that promote green growth, we can help to build the balanced, dynamic low carbon economy that is essential for our future prosperity.

This White Paper, with the associated Local Sustainable Transport Fund, demonstrates our commitment to taking this agenda forward.

I commend it to the House.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/baker-20110214,2,"**The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Norman Baker):** I am today publishing the Government's plans for [reforming the Blue Badge (Disabled Parking) Scheme](/topics/access/blue-badge/reform-of-the-blue-badge-scheme/). The measures that I am announcing will help those who rely on Blue Badges for mobility reasons. The measures will tackle rising levels of fraud and abuse, and will ensure both that badges are issued more fairly and that the scheme remains sustainable in the long term for those who rely on it most. These reforms will be delivered as soon as possible, and many within a year.

The Scheme helps over 2.5 million disabled people in England retain their independence, by enabling them to park close to jobs, services and facilities. However very few changes have been made to the scheme since it was established in the 1970s. Having listened to the views of badge holders, the general public, disabled people's groups and local authorities, it is evident that the scheme needs to be modernised to reduce current problems and deal with future challenges.

I want to ensure that the scheme focuses better on those whom it was intended to benefit. In particular, this means targeting those people who misuse and abuse it to the disadvantage of genuine badge holders. Secondly, this means ensuring that people have fair and equal access to the concession and the benefits it offers, regardless of where they live.

We are providing improved powers for local authorities to tackle abuse and fraud. This includes extending the grounds available to local authorities to refuse to issue and to withdraw badges and providing local authorities with a power to cancel badges that have been lost, stolen, have expired, or have been withdrawn for misuse. We are also providing local authority-authorised officers with an on-the-spot power to recover badges that have been cancelled or misused. We propose to amend existing legislation to clarify wrongful use of a badge and the powers to inspect badges.

To prevent abuse from happening in the first place and to deal with rising levels of fraud and abuse, we are implementing a new badge design that is harder to copy, forge and alter. Arrangements for printing, personalising and distributing the badge are also being changed and will enable more effective monitoring of cancelled, lost and stolen badges.

We are establishing, with local authorities, a common service delivery project which could deliver operational efficiency savings of up to £20m per year, help to reduce and prevent abuse and improve customer services. The project will also make available an on-line application facility which should result in faster, more automatic renewals for people whose circumstances do not change between renewal periods.

In order to ensure that badges are issued more fairly and consistently across the country, we are amending legislation to require wider use of independent mobility assessments to determine eligibility, including where previously that assessment was carried out by a GP. To support this, we are providing local authorities with control of the current National Health Service spend on Blue Badge assessments. In addition, new good practice guidance will be issued to local authorities to help them make improvements in scheme administration and eligibility assessment.

We are extending eligibility for a badge to some other people, to address current anomalies and issues of fairness. Eligibility is being extended to more disabled children between the ages of 2 and 3 with specific medical conditions and we are providing continuous automatic entitlement to a badge to severely disabled service personnel and veterans. We also intend to remove residency requirements for disabled service personnel and their families who are posted overseas on UK bases. This will enable them to apply for a badge.

To help cover costs more appropriately and to enable the delivery of a new badge design and the common service improvement project, we are raising the maximum fee for a badge that local authorities can charge from the £2 that it has been for nearly 30 years, to £10. The average benefit for badge holders from having a badge (and not having to pay parking charges) is estimated to be £300 over the three years for which most badges are valid. In return, badge holders will benefit from less abuse, improved accessibility and better customer services.

I am also publishing today, a [summary of responses to a public consultation](http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/closed/2010-20/) on the scheme.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/baker-20110216,3,"**Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Norman Baker)**: To complement the Local Transport White Paper 'Creating Growth, Cutting Carbon', my Department has been working on a basic carbon tool for Local Authorities to assist them in demonstrating the carbon benefits of transport interventions in their areas. Today, I am pleased to announce the publication of the draft basic carbon tool for Local Authorities on my Department's website1. 

The tool fully supports Local Authorities in making their own decisions about the carbon benefits of small scale interventions and enables them to input their own assumptions and data from best estimates of take-up and effects for their areas. The tool also brings together in one place central research on local transport and carbon, improves access to national transport data which can impact on emissions and simplifies carbon appraisal guidance. 

The tool can assist authorities in demonstrating the carbon benefits of bids to the Local Sustainable Transport Fund, but it is for Local Authorities to decide what tools and evidence best meet the criteria and objectives of the Fund in the context of their overall bids. My Department plans to publish the final tool in the summer. My officials have sent a letter to all Local Authority Chief Executives inviting views on the tool. A copy of this letter has been placed in the House library.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/baker-20110309,4,"**The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Norman Baker):** Today, I am announcing £10-million of new funding to be distributed to rural local transport authorities to kick-start the development of community transport services in their area.

In addition, we have formed a partnership with the Community Transport Association to provide each of the 76 rural local authorities in England with £2,600 worth of consultancy advice on how to establish, manage and make sustainable community transport operations within their area. There is the option for local authorities to supplement this with their own funds to receive further services.

This additional funding complements our recently announced Local Sustainable Transport Fund, which allows local authorities to bid for a share of £560m over 4 years, aimed at encouraging sustainable transport solutions, including Community Transport, that will create economic growth and cut carbon.

Public transport remains a key element in the sustainability and independence of rural communities: offering young people access to education and employment opportunities; linking customers to shops and services; and providing a lifeline to those without access to a car.

Where commercial bus services are not viable, Community Transport can play a valuable role in preventing isolation. I therefore strongly encourage local authorities to work in partnership with operators and local communities to examine how more flexible services might be provided.

Services such as dial-a-ride can, in some areas, be more efficient, effective and sustainable in the long term. I know that there are already many good examples of community groups and local authorities working together to deliver innovative solutions to rural transport needs and this is something we wish to see increased.

Today's package of support for Community Transport represents an important opportunity to invest in the future to provide more sustainable transport for local communities.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/baker-20110310,5,"**The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Norman Baker)**: Biofuels have an important role to play in efforts to tackle climate change, particularly where there is no viable alternative fuel on the horizon, as is the case with aviation and HGVs. In addition, they also have a role to play in promoting the security of energy supply. But we firmly believe that the potential carbon benefits of biofuels can only be realised if they are produced in a sustainable way.

My Department recognises that there are legitimate concerns about the sustainability of some biofuels. Biofuels are a continually developing technology and there is still scientific uncertainty about the sustainability of biofuels and their wider socio-economic impacts.

Much work is underway to better understand indirect sustainability effects. It is crucial that we establish strong sustainability criteria and a robust lifecycle carbon analysis to ensure first that biofuels deliver real greenhouse gas reductions and second, do not cause unacceptable environmental side effects in the process.

In particular, my Department takes the issue of indirect land use change seriously. We have recently published research on the scale of indirect land use change impacts and we are continuing to lead work on how to tackle these. The European Commission is in the process of assessing a range of options to address the issue of indirect land use change and I have written to the EU Energy, Environment and Climate Commissioners to impress on them the need for an adequate and robust solution.

Given the uncertainties, I believe it is right that this Government has taken additional time to review the subject carefully. There have been shifts in biofuels policy in the past so we need to ensure that policy decisions going forward are robust and stable, which will also give confidence to business to invest.

In addition to concerns regarding the sustainability of biofuels, we must also consider where biofuels would be best deployed across the transport sector. It may be best to focus use of what may well be limited supplies of sustainably sourced biofuel in transport modes where no other low carbon energy source is likely to be viable.

In April 2010, my Department commissioned work to determine how best biofuels should be deployed across all transport modes. In addition, the Government tasked the Committee on Climate Change to review the level of ambition for renewable energy.  These pieces of work are due to conclude over the coming months. The evidence we gather about the best use of biofuels across modes will inform our view of likely levels of uptake.

Given that biofuels policy has wide implications, I will continue to engage with Ministerial colleagues across Whitehall to ensure that government policy on biofuels is aligned going forward.

Today, I am publishing separate consultations on proposals to implement the European Renewable Energy and Fuel Quality Directives. Both of these Directives contain requirements related to the use of biofuels.

The Renewable Energy Directive requires the UK, by 2020, to source 15% of its overall energy, and 10% of energy used in transport, from renewable sources. The related Fuel Quality Directive requires fuel and energy suppliers (principally those providing fuel and energy for land-based transport) to reduce the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of the fuel/energy that they supply by 6 % per unit of energy by 2020.

Given the need to consider our developing evidence base, I do not propose to make any changes to the current biofuel supply trajectory that is set out in the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligations Order 2007. However, there will be a legal obligation on the Secretary of State to keep this issue under review and to consider what additional measures will be required to ensure that the UK delivers the requirements of the EU Renewable Energy and Fuel Quality Directives in the period 2014 to 2020. This approach should enable us to establish a stable biofuel policy that will allow industry to robustly plan for the period 2014 to 2020.

The two consultation documents set out proposals to implement the transport requirements of the Renewable Energy Directive through amendment of the UK's Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) and proposals to implement the Fuel Quality Directive through the amended RTFO and the proposed Motor Fuel Greenhouse Gas Saving Regulations.

Our implementation proposals involve making new provisions for biofuels to meet the EU biofuel sustainability criteria and introducing double certification for biofuels produced from wastes (such as used cooking oil) and other feedstocks that do not compete with food production or contribute to indirect land use change. In addition, we propose to put in place a 6% lifecycle greenhouse gas reduction obligation for 2020 and introduce requirements for the relevant fuel/energy suppliers to report on the lifecycle greenhouse gas performance of their fuels in the meantime.

The consultation period will run from today until 2 June and we aim to introduce and bring into force the relevant legislation completing the implementation of the transport elements of both Directives by the end of this year.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/baker-20110321,7,"**The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Norman Baker):** Today, I am announcing £836,000 of additional funding in this financial year to implement a number of small sustainable projects in the Cycle Towns and, separately, for three Train Operating Companies to enhance their bike and rail schemes. This exceptional decision has been made possible due to prudent management of Departmental expenditure, including additional efficiencies made this year.

The chosen Cycle Town projects Blackpool, Bristol, Cambridge, Colchester, Darlington, Derby, Exeter, Leighton Linslade, South Glos, Southend, Shrewsbury, Woking and York have been assessed as capable of being delivered within the current financial year whilst offering value for money. I believe this additional funding will assist in meeting the overall aims of the project to get more people cycling safely.  All the recommended projects fit well with the strategic objectives of the towns concerned and will increase the effectiveness of their existing programmes in generating additional cyclists.

The three Train Operating Companies, Merseyrail, South West Trains and Northern Rail, have worked hard, in partnership with local authorities and other organisations, including Sustrans and Network Rail, to deliver high-quality infrastructure improvements accompanied by promotional activities. This is with the aim of encouraging more cycling to railway stations and to deliver improved integration of bike and rail journeys. This money will enable further enhancements to these schemes.

Today's announcement complements, and is in addition to, our recently launched Local Sustainable Transport Fund which allows local authorities to bid for a share of £560m over four years, aimed at encouraging sustainable transport solutions, including Cycling initiatives, that will create economic growth and cut carbon.

This additional funding demonstrates the Government's continued commitment to cycling, recognising its potential contribution to reducing carbon emissions, improving health and creating economic growth.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/baker-20110523,8,"**Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Norman Baker):** I am today publishing our [response](http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/closed/2010-33/) to the comments received in the consultation on proposals to amend the criteria defining strategic national corridors (SNCs) and confirming the action we will take.

The strategic national corridors were established in 2009 to define the network over which the largest proportion of strategic traffic - that is traffic travelling between the ten largest urban areas, ten busiest ports and seven busiest airports in England - moves around the country. The original definition also provided for connectivity between the four nations of the United Kingdom, but there was no specific provision for connecting capital cities.

We concluded that the routes linking Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast to the nearest urban strategic destination should be recognised for the strategic connectivity that they provide, and consulted accordingly. After taking account of the consultation responses I can now confirm that we are going ahead with this change.

Specifically, we identified two routes as having national significance: namely the A1 between its junction with the A19 north of Newcastle and the Scottish Border, providing a defined link to Edinburgh; and a route between Bootle and the Twelve Quays Ferry Terminal in Birkenhead, providing connectivity with Belfast. Again, after taking account of the consultation responses, I can confirm that these routes will henceforth become roads of national significance.

A number of other suggestions were made for changes to the SNCs, including specific proposals for increases in coverage. My Department will reconsider the scope and role of the SNCs once the LEPs are well established and their role in transport decision-making is clear.

The consultation documents, including the consultation response, can be found on my Department's website. An electronic copy has been lodged with the House library.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/baker-20110607,9,"**The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Norman Baker):** The cross-Government review of Non-Departmental Public Bodies, responding to this House in October 2010, decided that the public bodies landscape needed radical reform to increase accountability, cut out duplication of activity, increase transparency and discontinue activities that were no longer needed. Amongst the recommendations was that DPTAC be abolished. 

The Public Bodies Bill is currently before Parliament. The Bill as drafted, would allow the Government to make an Order abolishing DPTAC. If the Bill is passed with this provision in it, I am minded to make such an Order. But before coming to a definite decision to do so, I intend to consult on the Order and will make no final decision until I have taken into account the responses to that consultation. 

In advance of this formal consultation I am inviting views from all those with an interest on what successor arrangements should be put in place if DPTAC is abolished. I am seeking to ensure that any successor arrangement will continue to provide my Department with consensual, pan-disability advice in a flexible way, and that any arrangement represents value for money. 

I propose to invite comments on the options listed below: 

  * Option 1: Rely on existing expertise in the Department for Transport policy divisions and agencies. Where ad-hoc specific advice is needed, it could be sought by individual policy divisions from third party stakeholder groups, the transport industry, and experts. This would have minimal cost (although commissioned, consultancy advice could be expensive) but perhaps risks disability issues being overlooked. 
  * Option 2: Establish a stakeholder forum, which could be convened and provide advice as and when issues arose. Again this would have minimal cost, but could again result in an increased consultancy bill. It might also be difficult to decide who to appoint to the forum. There are over 50 disability groups, and their interests sometimes conflict (e.g. the interests of the visually impaired, and those using mobility scooters). Achieving consensus could therefore be difficult. 
  * Option 3: Rely on a cross-government body to provide transport advice - for example the existing (non statutory) Equality 2025, run by the Department of Work and Pensions. This option should ensure that disability issues do not get overlooked. Equality 2025 is likely to be able to offer general advice - for example on transport access to the Olympics by disabled people - but would not be in a position to offer more specialist advice, for example the type of mobility scooter models suitable to be carried on public transport. 
  * Option 4: Establish a non-statutory specialist body which would be flexible and accountable to Ministers. This may cost more than the options above, but should be less expensive than the current arrangements. However, a smaller body because of its size, may not cover all disability areas, and therefore could reduce the opportunities to provide pan-disability advice. 
  * Option 5: A wide ranging panel of experts from which members could be drawn, on an ad hoc basis, when specific advice is needed. A once a year meeting of all specified stakeholders could be held so that they all have the opportunity of voicing wider concerns. 

My initial thinking is that option 5 would be the most appropriate path to take, but I would welcome views to inform my decision making in this area.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/baker-2011061,10,"**Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Norman Baker):** I have decided to impose a penalty on Chiltern Railway of £350,000, having taken account of the outcome of a statutory consultation process.

The penalty relates to four breaches of the terms of the company's franchise agreement which occurred before management of Chiltern transferred to Arriva UK Trains in early 2011. These involved late delivery of two station improvements, and two timetable changes which were not properly authorised by the Department for Transport and which could, if unrectified, have significantly reduced the value of the franchise to the Department. These breaches were in the context of the company's poor performance in meeting a number of its detailed contractual obligations over a substantial period.

The Department imposes such penalties very rarely. When it does so, the aim is to encourage train operators to comply with their contractual obligations to the Department under franchise agreements. It should be emphasised that the penalty does not relate to Chiltern's operational performance. As a number of consultees commented, the company is noted for its high standard of performance and customer satisfaction, and for the substantial investment it is making in improving services.

The penalty has been reduced from the proposed level of £500,000 in the light of the responses to the consultation, and in particular the welcome and clear assurances from Chiltern that it has stepped up its commitment and oversight at senior management level to ensure compliance with the terms of its franchise.

The receipts from the penalty will be retained by the Department and reinvested in transport. No decision has been made at this stage as to the final use of the funds.

The Department has received 73 bids to Tranche One of the Local Sustainable Transport Fund from 66 lead authorities. All bids were for small projects requiring less than £5m funding from DfT. 12 bids were submitted as ""key components"" to large projects.

Proposals were assessed against the criteria as published in the [Guidance on the Application Process](http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/local-sustainable-transport-fund-guidance-on-the-application-process), which was published on 19th January. Successful proposals were those judged to perform well against the twin objectives of supporting the local economy and facilitating economic development, and of reducing carbon emissions. 

If proposals met these initial criteria, they were also scored on their potential to deliver wider social and economic benefits, to improve safety, to bring about improvements to air quality, or to promote increased levels of physical activity. 

Proposals were required to demonstrate financial sustainability with benefits enduring beyond the life of the Fund, to incorporate a credible delivery plan, and to include a commitment to make a local contribution towards the overall costs.

In line with the published guidance, an assessment of value for money was undertaken. The Department is confident that the overall package of proposals approved in this first round represents high value for money. 

I have decided to fund 39 proposals in this round. 34 proposals will be funded in full and a further 5 proposals will be funded in part. 13 proposals are considered to have potential when scored against the fund criteria, but in my view require further work. 

Their promoters will be invited to improve their offer and resubmit to the Department in February 2012, or to improve their offer in the context of their large project proposal, where this proposal is shortlisted. The full list of decisions is attached.

By the deadline of 6th June, the Department received 19 expressions of interest for larger projects (requesting between £5m and £50m funding from DfT). I intend to announce at the end of July the shortlist of those authorities invited to prepare a detailed business case for their proposal. Detailed business cases will be submitted to the Department by December 2011. The Department has received 41 expressions of interest for Tranche Two small project funding, for submission by February 2012. I intend to announce successful projects in this second round in the early Summer of 2012.

I am very pleased that all eligible local authorities across England (with the exception of the Isles of Scilly) have now applied for funding to the Local Sustainable Transport Fund, either as a lead bidder, or as a partner authority to a large project. The Fund has been well received by local government and I am confident that it will be effective in addressing the two key objectives of supporting growth and cutting carbon.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/baker-20110714,12,"**The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Norman Baker):** I am pleased to announce that I have today laid the Humber Bridge (Debts) Order 2011 before Parliament.

The Order provides for the interest rate payable on the debt owed by the Humber Bridge Board to the Department for Transport to continue to remain at the reduced rate equivalent to 4.25 per cent on the total debt of £332 million during the period 1 April 2011 to 31 March 2016. The debt represents borrowing from Government for the construction of the Humber Bridge and the subsequent capitalisation of annual deficits in the early years of its operation.

Without this Order, the interest rate payable on that part of the debt not suspended (£275 million) would revert to 7.75 per cent, as set by the Humber Bridge (Debts) Order 1998. 

The value of the interest rate reduction to the Humber Bridge Board amounts to £48 million over the five years, which the Board can use to fund maintenance and renewals and/or to make capital repayments. 

This Order demonstrates a major commitment by this Government to the council tax payers, travelling public and businesses of the Humber area. Without it, the Humber Bridge Board would have been obliged either to surcharge council tax payers in the Humber area, or to increase the tolls on the bridge by as much as 60 per cent.

The arrangement forms part of the base case for second phase of the Humber Bridge Review announced on 14 June, and is made separately to the process of the Review, which is now under way and on which the Economic Secretary to the Treasury and I will make a further announcement in November. 

I have stated that the reduced interest rate on the loan is the equivalent of 4.25 per cent payable on the entire debt of £332 million. In 2011/12 this will comprise 5.13% charged on the active portion of the debt (£275 million) and nil payable on the suspended portion of the debt (£57 million). As set out in the 1998 Order, the suspended portion of the debt will progressively be added back into the active debt over the three years to 2014. The interest rate will be reduced accordingly to equate to the 4.25 per cent on the whole debt. Therefore the rate payable on the active debt in the three years 2011/12 to 2013/14 will be 5.13 per cent, 4.82 per cent and 4.52 per cent respectively. 

This Order is made under the provisions of the Humber Bridge (Debts) Act 1996, and comes into force on 9 August.  Upon the coming into force of this Order, a revised loan agreement will be signed between the Secretary of State and the Humber Bridge Board.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/baker-20111013,13,"**The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Norman Baker)**: Great Britain has one of the safest road networks in the world and the quality and clarity of our traffic signs make a significant contribution to this. The Department for Transport has now completed the most significant review of traffic signs for over forty years to ensure that this traffic sign system continues to meet the needs of road users now and in the future.

I am pleased to announce that the Department is today publishing the policy document, ""Signing the Way"", which sets out the findings of the review. This document provides a framework for a new traffic sign system which retains national consistency, but reduces central government involvement in local decisions, reducing costs and giving local authorities the flexibility to respond to local needs. It also sets out our proposals for streamlining the Traffic Regulation Order process which would reduce costs and time.

The review recognises that our travel behaviour is changing and that people are being encouraged to cycle and to walk where practical. The traffic sign system needs to reflect these changes and this review will ensure that our traffic signs meet the needs of all road users.

Traffic signs also directly affect how much clutter there is on our roads. While road users require traffic signs to undertake their journeys safely and legally, too much signing creates an untidy, unattractive and confusing environment. The review sets out measures to reduce the number of signs on the road and provides advice to local authorities on removing unnecessary signing.

The Review requires a major update of the Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions and the Department is proceeding with this work as a priority. In the interim, we will deliver changes where possible through the Secretary of State's traffic signs authorisation process.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/baker-20111107,14,"**The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Norman Baker):** Today I am publishing our response to the comments received in the consultation on our proposals for implementing the transport aspects of the Renewable Energy Directive (RED), confirming action we will take to implement this Directive in the UK.

The RED requires the UK to source 10% of energy used in transport from renewable sources by 2020 and is closely related to the Fuel Quality Directive (FQD) which requires fuel suppliers to land-based transport and similar applications to deliver a 6% reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions from their fuels by 2020.

Our policy on biofuels is relevant to both Directives. There remain a number of uncertainties regarding the sustainability of biofuels and their best use. However, I do believe that genuinely sustainable biofuels have an important role to play in our efforts to tackle climate change and in security of energy supply. This is particularly so in areas where there is no viable alternative fuel on the horizon such as for HGVs and aviation.

It is crucial that we do all we can to ensure that biofuels both deliver real greenhouse gas emission reductions and do not cause unacceptable environmental and social side effects in the process. There is much work being undertaken, nationally and internationally, to better understand the indirect effects related to biofuels and to investigate how the negative indirect effects can be reduced.

As the Directives currently stand, they do not take into account these indirect effects. While the extent of these impacts remains uncertain, there is robust evidence that widespread use of some biofuels can lead to significant indirect greenhouse gas emissions through the process known as indirect land use change (ILUC). The UK takes the issue of ILUC seriously. Earlier this year we published research on the scale of ILUC impacts and we are continuing to lead work on how to tackle these as well as encouraging the European Commission to address this issue on a Europe-wide scale with a robust solution. I have written to the European Commission twice, expressing the Government's concerns regarding ILUC and pressing for robust and proportionate action to be taken to address the impacts of ILUC.

There are concerns regarding the best use and deployment of biofuels. These concerns also extend to the issue of best use of biomass across all sectors. Since our consultations on the RED and FQD opened, the Committee on Climate Change has published advice on renewable energy. The Government is now considering this advice and awaiting the Committee's further advice on the best use of bioenergy across all sectors. Further evidence will also be drawn from the results of the Department's research into the best use of biofuels across transport modes and the Department's call for evidence on the future of aviation policy: [""Developing a sustainable framework for UK aviation: Scoping document""](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110509101621/http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/open/2011-09/consultationdocument.pdf). In addition, the Government is working in a cross-departmental way to develop a bioenergy strategy which will look at the use of sustainable bioenergy across transport, heat and power as well as the impacts on other sectors.

The results of these reports and studies will establish a robust evidence base. When we have this evidence we will set biofuel targets beyond those set out to 2014 under the current Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO).

On the other hand, in response to those who have called for biofuel targets to be scrapped entirely, we continue to be of the view that there is a place for sustainable biofuels in our wider policy on carbon reduction. The UK must, in law, comply with the RED. Biofuels will be a key component in the achievement of these targets before that work has been completed.

We will prioritise implementation of the RED over that of the related FQD in order to ensure that financial reward is no longer given to those biofuels that do not meet the RED sustainability criteria. Most of what will be delivered through the FQD will be delivered by the closely-related RED, which we expect to be implemented through an amended Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation in December 2011, subject to the Parliamentary process.

Our consultations on proposals to implement the RED and FQD revealed a number of concerns regarding expansion of the RTFO to include fuels use in non-road mobile machinery (NRMM). Industry has requested additional time to prepare for this and we are considering how best to achieve this change. As such, we do not propose to bring into force any expansion of the RTFO to include NRMM fuels before April 2013.

In addition there remains uncertainty regarding key implementing measures for the FQD, which are currently being discussed at the European level.

However, we do intend to introduce new regulations to transpose the FQD requirement to reduce emissions by 6% by 2020, alongside new annual reporting requirements for fossil fuels and biofuels. We will be working towards putting the necessary legislation in place as soon as possible during the course of 2012.

The response published today sets out our decision to fully transpose all the sustainability criteria set out in the RED to ensure that the UK only rewards the supply of sustainable biofuel. Until we have a more robust evidence base, we cannot confidently set biofuel targets beyond those established under the current RTFO.

I would like to thank all those who took the time to respond to these consultations.

I am therefore pleased to announce today a further £37.5m of ""mid-tier"" Access for All funding for projects requiring up to £1m of Government support. 

This forms part of the wider £370m Access for All programme launched in 2006 which will deliver an accessible, step free route at 148 key stations. Rail passengers will benefit from better access through the provision of new lifts, ramps, raised ""easier access humps"" on platforms as well as new accessible toilets.

Major improvements will take place at stations across the country including at London Paddington, St. Austell, Stratford, Stratford-upon-Avon and Ystrad Mynach.  Network Rail will also receive funding to add tactile edge paving at 27 stations and £5m to provide ""easy access humps"" to reduce the stepping distance between the platform and the train. The full list of successful stations will be made available on the Department for Transport's website.

All work at the stations will be completed by March 2014. We are also taking the opportunity to increase the funding allocated to train operating companies. This funding will increase from £5m a year to £7m a year for the next three years, beginning in April 2012. It is based on the number of stations that they manage and is used to deliver smaller scale or more locally focused access improvements at stations.

Finally, I have agreed to release £57m from the existing budget earlier than planned to allow the accelerated delivery of obstacle free routes at 27 stations.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/baker-20111206-2,16,"**The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Norman Baker)**: I am pleased to announce that, following consultation, the Department will be devolving responsibility for roads classification and aspects of the Primary Route Network from April 2012.

This marks the first major revision of these systems since the first Wilson government, and represents a major decentralisation of power. It will greatly improve the ability of local authorities to make changes on their roads, and greatly reduce the amount of central government resource needed to run the system.

Under the new system:

  * Local authorities will have control over roads classification decisions in their area, determining which roads should be 'A' roads, 'B' roads, etc.
  * Local authorities will be able to set the roads used by the Primary Route Network ('A' roads with green signs), while central government retains oversight of the whole system.
  * Central government will continue to look after the strategic road network.

For roads classification and the Primary Route Network, the Department for Transport will reduce its role to handling appeals cases and any disputes which might arise between local authorities, leaving local authorities to manage their roads in the manner they judge most effective.

As part of the consultation, we also took the opportunity to examine whether there might be better ways to link the management of the system with satnav technology. The Department will be taking this work forward, and will make a further statement in the new year.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/baker-20111207,17,"**The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Norman Baker):** I am pleased to announce today a £60 million package of bus measures to improve buses and community transport coupled with the £30m investment to improve the environmental performance of the bus fleet that was announced by the Chancellor in the autumn statement, this is a £90 million boost for our buses.

A new £50m Better Bus Area Fund will provide grants of up to £5m to a minimum of 10 local authorities working in partnership with local bus operators for them to spend in 2012-13. The aim of the fund is to increase bus patronage in busy urban areas, and the Department's aims of creating growth and cutting carbon.  
Authorities wishing to bid for bus funding will be asked to submit bids in February to allow the Department to make awards by the end of March. Detailed bidding guidance will be placed on the departmental website shortly.

To support further the establishment and development of Community Transport, I am also making available £10m to be distributed to 76 local authorities in England, outside London, by formula; this is a repeat of the _Supporting Community Transport Fund_ announced in March 2011. Letters will be sent to eligible local authorities in the New Year, with details of the timing of payments. This comes on top of the £10 million distributed back in March 2011.

As well as these two new funds, last week the Chancellor announced £25m of funding for environmental improvement to buses. £20m of this will be available to bus operators to help them buy low-carbon emission buses through a further round of the Green Bus Fund, for which detail bidding guidance will be published shortly. The remaining £5m will allow older buses in London to be retrofitted with pollution-reducing equipment to help deliver air quality improvements in the capital. Together with additional funding from Transport for London, the total amount being committed is £10m. Not only should this deliver a step change in the environmental performance of buses in the capital, but it will help promote jobs across the UK in the companies that supply clean vehicle technology.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/baker-20120110,18,"The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Norman Baker): I am today providing an update on implementation of the Blue Badge reform programme that I announced in February 2011.

One of the key reforms to the Blue Badge scheme is the Blue Badge Improvement Service. This service has been developed in close consultation with disabled people and local authorities. It is a major initiative aimed at tackling rising levels of badge fraud and abuse, helping to ensure that disabled people receive improved customer service and ensuring that the scheme remains sustainable in the long term for those who rely on it most.

The Blue Badge Improvement Service became operational on 1 January 2012. I am pleased to say that every local authority in England has signed up to use the service and I would like to thank them all for their support in helping to deliver important and necessary changes that are vital for the future sustainable operation of the Blue Badge scheme. The Service should also help them to realise efficiency savings of up to £20m per year.

In an innovative move by the Department for Transport, the capital costs of the service are being met through private sector investment from Northgate Information Solutions who will deliver the secure web-based service, and Payne Security who will print, supply and distribute the newly designed badge.

The service establishes a common store of key information on badges and badge holders that will enable verification checks to be made quickly and easily.

To counter fraud, the design of the Blue Badge was changed in Regulations that came into force on 1 December 2011. The old-style cardboard badges have been replaced by new ones made from a fused and bonded hard plastic material and which contain a number of overt and covert security features.

For the first time, people can now apply for a Blue Badge using a national system that is available on Directgov. This should result in a quicker turnaround time for people re-applying for badges whose circumstances are not going to change. Those who use the online application form will only be asked to complete those sections that are relevant to the eligibility under which they are applying. They can also sign up for text and email reminders at re-application time, track the progress of their application and there will be an eligibility checker for those who want to find out if they are eligible for a badge. From 1 April 2012, badge holders will be able to report lost and stolen badges and update changes to their details online.

There is a new national helpline for general enquiries about Blue Badges that will signpost callers to the relevant local authority. However, local authorities will still be in charge of administering the Blue Badge scheme, making decisions about whether applicants are eligible and issuing badges.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/baker-20120117,19,"The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Norman Baker): I am pleased to announce the launch of a Plug-In Van Grant alongside the continuation of the existing Plug-In Car Grant to help stimulate the market for ultra-low emission vehicles. The Plug-In Van Grant, available to both private and business buyers across the UK, will provide a point of purchase discount of 20%, up to a maximum value of £8,000, for the purchase of eligible new ultra-low emission vans1.

Minister of State for Business and Innovation Mark Prisk and I have reviewed the existing Plug-In Car Grant, which provides a discount of 25%, up to £5,000 off the price of eligible ultra-low emission cars. We examined the need for and value of the grant, as well as its scope. We have concluded that there remains a strong case for the grant. We have therefore decided to continue with the Plug-In Car Grant at the current level, with provision out to 2015.

In addition, we are persuaded that there is a strong case for supporting ultra-low emission technology in vans - which often have fixed duty cycles and return to base regularly where they can easily recharge. An upfront purchase grant, when combined with the lower running costs and tax benefits, can make switching to an ultra-low emission van an attractive choice for businesses. The Plug-In Van Grant, alongside the existing Plug-In Car Grant, is designed to help private individuals and businesses adopt new, cleaner technology. Businesses, especially those with fleets, will be a key driver in increasing the market share of ultra-low emission vehicles.

The shift towards clean technology is an opportunity to further reinvigorate the UK automotive industry, where many van manufacturers are based, alongside helping to increase our energy security. The Plug-In Van Grant will help to improve local air quality in our cities, reduce carbon emissions and meet Government targets. The technology fits well with a large portion of the van market that relies on short urban trips to and from base.'

Only [vans which meet strict performance criteria for range, tail-pipe emissions and safety will be eligible](/topics/sustainable/olev/plug-in-van-grant/) for the Plug-In Van Grant. We are today opening the application process and inviting van manufacturers to apply for their vehicles to become part of the scheme. Applications can be received at any time. I expect to confirm shortly the first vans to join the scheme, for which applications will need to be received by 31 January.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/baker-20120126,20,"**The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Norman Baker):** I am today publishing the outcome of the Government's consultation on proposals to allow trials of lane rental schemes to be undertaken by a small number of 'pioneer' local authorities. Lane rental would involve the local authority applying a daily charge where street works obstruct traffic at the busiest times, providing a clear financial incentive for works to be carried out in less disruptive ways.

The Government is now inviting applications from authorities wishing to operate 'pioneer' schemes. The guidance I am publishing today makes clear that the Government is prepared to approve up to three such schemes, in areas where the local authority has already sought to achieve the desired effect through other means, including through a road works permit scheme. Lane rental charges would need to be targeted on those streets where works cause the greatest disruption, and would need to provide a genuine opportunity for works promoters to avoid charges by carrying out their works at less disruptive times. Evidence from the performance of the 'pioneer' schemes will inform future decisions on whether lane rental should play a wider role. Any revenues raised from lane rental will have to be used for purposes that will help to reduce the disruption caused by works - for example research and development into disruption-saving techniques and technologies.

The guidance and other documents are now being published on the Department for Transport's website, and I will be laying the necessary Regulations before Parliament shortly.

The projects funded by this package support the key objectives of the £560m Local Sustainable Transport Fund - building a strong economy and tackling carbon. This additional £15m funding will be geared to supporting jobs, enhancing access to employment and supporting the end to end journey, helping to bring about changing patterns of travel behaviour and encouraging greater use of more sustainable transport modes.

The projects will be delivered to meet local demand and needs, and will be implemented through Sustrans and the Cycle Rail Working Group.

Sustrans will receive £8m to create routes along the lines of their successful ""Peoples' Millions"" Connect2 programme, further building on the Department's investment in Links to Schools, which have seen the construction of safe, traffic free and traffic calmed routes for cyclists and pedestrians between schools and the National Cycle Network.

The Cycle Rail Working Group will receive £7m to invest in improving integration between cycle and rail at stations across the country, including through improved cycle facilities at stations. This additional sum will complement other projects already being delivered by Network Rail, who are themselves delivering a £7m programme of cycle facilities at stations and safe access routes to stations.

Further details of the projects to be taken forward will be announced by press notice, and deposited in the libraries of the House, in March.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/baker-20120301,22,"The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Norman Baker): In 2010, the Department for Transport undertook a consultation into possible reforms of the use on the highway of mobility scooters and powered wheelchairs (referred to in legislation as ""invalid carriages"").

I am today publishing the Department's response to the consultation. A summary of the results of the consultation is also attached to that document.

I have concluded that no changes should be made regarding the following issues, which formed part of the consultation:

  * speed limits and maximum permitted speeds;
  * the minimum age for using a Class 3 vehicle; and
  * the law relating to the use of a mobility scooter by only one person.

I do not, at this stage, propose that there should be an alternative to the current arrangements for registering Class 3 vehicles or any additional requirements for making vehicles conspicuous, such as adding reflective strips to vehicles or a requirement on users to wear high visibility jackets. I have decided that the maximum unladen weight of Class 2 powered wheelchairs should be increased to 150kgs, but that the Class 2 mobility scooter should stay at the current maximum unladen weight of 113.4kgs.

I have also decided that the legal term ""invalid carriage"" should be replaced with a more suitable and contemporary term, and have asked officials to consider how this might be achieved, recognising that unfortunately, the term is set by primary legislation.

I indicated in Parliamentary Answers last autumn (Official Report 26 October 2011: Column 249W and 27 October 2011: Column 284W) that I was considering the case for mandatory eyesight testing. I have concluded that this is not necessary for users of Class 2 vehicles, but in response to points made by respondents to the consultation, I believe the position in respect of Class 3 scooters requires further consideration. To that end, I intend to convene a meeting of interested parties to review the available evidence and options, including matters relating to insurance and the use of specialist training providers. I am conscious of the crucial role such vehicles play in some people's lives and that will be an important factor in deciding what further actions, if any, to take.

From 2013, the police will be able to record whether a vehicle has been involved in an accident on the public highway, but I have also asked officials to examine how current legislation aimed at reducing accidents could be better enforced.

The Transport Select Committee invited the Department to look into the carriage of mobility scooters on public transport. The Confederation of Passenger Transport has produced a Code of Practice regarding carriage on buses, while train operators have their own individual arrangements. I have asked my Department to work with transport operators and the industry to develop a kite marking scheme for public transport, which would enable a disabled person to have more confidence that they can travel with their mobility scooter - this work is currently underway. I have also asked officials to work with the industry on suitable designs for public transport. I will report back on this work as soon as possible.

I am also publishing today, improved guidance and information for mobility vehicle users.

This follows a consultation launched by the previous government.

The maximum charge for the busiest streets will rise from £2,500 a day to £5,000 a day for the first three days of overrun and £10,000 a day thereafter, rather than the £25,000 per day planned by the previous administration. I consider that the new charge level will result in a decrease in the number of works which overrun their agreed period, and better reflect the congestion costs overrunning works impose on society.

I also intend to change the regulations such that works planned to be only of a short duration attract the same overrun charge as those of longer planned durations, in recognition of the fact that all these works cause equivalent disruption to the road user.

These changes are in line with the Government's commitment to ensure regulatory proposals are proportionate, our desire to see congestion caused by roadworks reduce, and for utilities and others who work in our streets to be held accountable for that congestion.

The full consultation response can be [found on the Department's website](/consultations/dft-2010-13).

To take forward these proposals, I will lay regulations before this House in the summer. It is my intention that the changes come into force in October of this year.

Taken together, this significant investment will get more people on buses, and so aid the Department's overarching objectives of helping to create growth and cut carbon.

The quality of the bids for the Better Bus Area Fund and Green Bus Fund have been excellent and I am pleased to report that because of the prudent financial management of the Department's funds by the Secretary of State and her Ministerial team, I have been able to increase the allocations previously announced, from £20m to £31m in respect of the Green Bus Fund, and from £50m to £70m in respect of the Better Bus Area Fund.

Projects under these two funds will help drive forward our bus travel in England, helping buy, amongst other things:

  * 439 low-carbon buses to forge the future of the low carbon economy (we expect the majority of these to be manufactured in the UK);
  * the development of hop-on hop-off multi-operator tickets that put spontaneity back into the hands of the passenger;
  * real time information for bus passengers and for bus operators to cut down waiting time and prevent buses bunching up. No more waiting for a bus and then three come along at once;
  * smarter traffic lights that recognise buses and give them priority with barely an impact on other traffic.

24 lead local transport authorities across England will benefit from the £70m Better Bus Area Fund, right across the country. 5 local transport authorities and 26 bus companies have been awarded £31 million of Green Bus funding.

Together this package will encourage people onto the bus, cutting congestion, promoting a low carbon transport infrastructure and encouraging growth.

Documents listing the successful bidders under each competition have been placed in the libraries of the House, and are being published on the DfT website.

I will be in a position to make a further statement on bus subsidy reform in the near future.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/baker-20120326a,25,"**The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Norman Baker):** I am today announcing a series of reforms which I propose to make to improve the system of local bus subsidy and regulation in England. These are set out in the paper 'Green Light for Better Buses', copies of which I have placed in the libraries of the House.

I am also pleased to announce today an extra £15 million in funding for increasing the uptake of smart ticketing equipment, particularly among small and medium-sized companies. This makes a total bus funding package of £115m, if taken alongside last week's announcement (_Official Report_ 23 March 2012, Column 81WS) on Better Bus Areas (£70 million) and the Green Bus Fund (£31 million).  This considerable sum underlines the Coalition Government's firm commitment to investment in transport infrastructure, tackling congestion, and decarbonising transport.

Over the past year, I have been discussing with bus companies, local transport authorities and passenger groups the need for reforms to the Bus Services Operator Grant which the Government pays to every company that runs local bus services. The system of subsidy we have inherited is poorly targeted. It does not distinguish between profitable services and those that require local council support. It does not take into account the differing public transport needs of urban and rural areas. And it does little to incentivise fuel efficient buses.

The proposals I am announcing today have been carefully formulated to attract more people onto buses, to ensure better value for the taxpayer and to give local transport authorities more influence over their local bus networks. They also signal a move to break the link between fuel use and subsidy.

The Government has also responded today to the recommendations from the Competition Commission's report into the supply of local bus services in the UK (excluding Northern Ireland and London). We have committed to introduce regulatory changes that will remove the barriers facing bus companies that attempt to engage in competition on new bus routes and in new bus markets.

We will also support and guide urban areas in their efforts to introduce new reasonably-priced tickets that can be used on any bus, not just on those of a single company. And we will help local councils in their procurement of tendered bus services.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/baker-20120517a,26,"**The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Norman Baker)**: I have today given final approval to proceed with a pilot of Tram Train technology in South Yorkshire. I have asked South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive to lead the delivery of the vehicles and to sponsor the pilot in collaboration with Network Rail, Northern Rail and Stagecoach Supertram.

The pilot I am announcing today will allow us to determine the practical and operational issues of extending Tram Trains from the national network to on-street running and running trams and heavy rail vehicles safely over existing heavy rail infrastructure. It will also allow us to gauge passenger perception and acceptability of Tram Train.

The knowledge that we obtain from the pilot will enable us to understand the technical and operational challenges involved in this project so that the concept can potentially be rolled out elsewhere in the UK.

The pilot will see the introduction from 2015 of new Tram Train vehicles capable of using both light and heavy rail infrastructure, so providing continuous travel from Sheffield's Supertram network onto Network Rail's national rail network, as well as providing more capacity on the Supertram system itself.

The new vehicles will provide three services an hour operating from Parkgate Retail Park in Rotherham, travelling through Rotherham Central Station and joining up to the existing Supertram network at Meadowhall where the services will then continue onwards to Sheffield City Centre. The project is also expected to create 25 new driver jobs locally, plus around 10 additional jobs in maintenance and revenue protection.

The pilot will run for two years and alongside the additional capacity being provided for the Supertram system, is expected to cost £58 million, including the cost of the vehicles and infrastructure changes.

On 24 February 2012, the Department received 53 bids to Tranche Two of the Local Sustainable Transport Fund from 48 lead authorities.

Proposals were assessed against the criteria as published in the Guidance on the Application Process, which was published on 19 January 2011. Successful proposals were those judged to perform well against the twin objectives of supporting the local economy and facilitating economic development, while reducing carbon emissions. They were also scored on their potential to deliver wider social and economic benefits, to improve safety, to bring about improvements to air quality, or to promote increased levels of physical activity.

Proposals were required to demonstrate financial sustainability with benefits enduring beyond the life of the Fund, to incorporate a credible delivery plan, and to include a commitment to make a local contribution towards the overall costs.

In line with the published guidance, an assessment of value for money was undertaken. The Department is confident that the overall package of proposals approved in this second round represents high value for money.

I have decided to announce funding for 30 proposals in this round today, with a further announcement regarding the status of 18 more bids to be made soon. 26 proposals will be funded in full and a further 4 proposals will be funded in part. The list of decisions made today regarding Tranche 2 bids is attached.

On 20 December 2011, the Department received 13 business cases for larger projects (requiring up to £50 million funding from DfT). I intend to announce by the end of June which of those authorities have been successful.

I am very pleased that all eligible local authorities across England have applied for funding to the Local Sustainable Transport Fund, either as a lead bidder, or as a partner authority to a large project. The Fund has been well received by local government and I am confident that it will be effective in addressing the two key objectives of creating growth and cutting carbon.

This funding unlocks further local funding sources to deliver £460m investment in local sustainable transport schemes.

Today's announcement is the third and final instalment of the Local Sustainable Transport Fund, which is now delivering over £1 billion investment in sustainable travel across England, and demonstrating that economic growth and carbon reduction go hand in hand. To facilitate today's announcements, I have secured an additional £40m for the Fund, on top of the original £560m allocation.

On 20 December 2011, the Department received 13 business cases for Large Projects for the Local Sustainable Transport Fund.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/baker-20120709a,30,"**The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Norman Baker)**: I am today publishing a [consultation document on Personal Independence Payment and eligibility for a Blue Badge](/consultations/dft-2012-30/). The consultation period closes on Tuesday 2 October 2012.

The Coalition Government is taking forward important reforms to the welfare system. One of these reforms will involve changes to Disability Living Allowance and will affect eligibility for a disabled person's parking permit or Blue Badge. About a third of all badges are currently issued to people who receive the higher rate of the mobility component of Disability Living Allowance. My Department is therefore consulting on the options we have for dealing with the impact of the changes. The consultation covers arrangements for England only.

I am committed to ensuring that the Blue Badge scheme continues to be focused on those people who will benefit most from the parking concessions that it offers, and that it is sustainable in the future. The Government has identified three main options for responding to the implementation of Personal Independence Payments. The three main options are:

  * Option 1 - no legislative link between eligibility for a Blue Badge and eligibility to Personal Independence Payment,
  * Option 2 - establishing a legislative link between Blue Badge eligibility and the enhanced mobility component of Personal Independence Payment,
  * Option 3 - establishing a legislative link between Blue Badge eligibility and those who score 8 points or more within the 'Moving Around' activity within Personal Independence Payment. This assesses a person's physical ability to get around.

The Government's preferred option is Option 3 as it would mean that eligibility for a Blue Badge would be most similar to the current scheme and the potential impacts of this option are minimal. We will, however, consider this in light of views and comments sent in as part of the consultation. The Government is also asking for other suggestions for other practical and sustainable solutions.

The consultation concludes on 2 October 2012. Personal Independence Payments will be introduced for new claimants aged between 16 and 64 from April 2013 onwards. It will begin to replace Disability Living Allowance for existing recipients aged between 16 and 64 from October 2013 onwards. Any consequential changes to the Blue Badge scheme will also be phased in and will affect existing badge holders when an existing badge expires and they need to apply for a new one.

A copy of the consultation document has been placed in the library of the House.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/baker-20120710a,31,"**The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Norman Baker)**: In line with the Government's transparency agenda, and the commitments made in the Command Paper 'Reforming our Railways: Putting the Customer First', additional information will from today be made available by the Office of Rail Regulation and Network Rail about the punctuality of train services.

In addition to the existing Public Performance Measure (PPM), which indicates the proportion of train services arriving at their destination within 5 or 10 minutes, for short and long distance services respectively, information will now be published on trains which are 'right time' at their final destination - that is, which arrive early or within a minute of the due time.

PPM is and will remain the Government's and industry's key measure of rail punctuality and reliability:

  * it recognises the different passenger expectations and operating practicalities between short and long distance services;
  * it incentivises the industry to ensure that the vast majority of services - significantly over 90% - get to their destination at or close to time; and
  * it gives the industry essential flexibility to manage minor operational disruption, which would not be possible with an absolute on time measure.

But the Coalition Government recognises that passengers want more information about their services, including whether they are actually on time, and that is why Ministers have asked the industry to develop plans to provide this. We welcome the positive response which it has now made.

As a first step, the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) is today publishing annual statistics on right time performance at industry sector level - ie Long Distance, London and South East, and Regional (including Scotland), going back to 2001/02. Network Rail (NR) will from now on be updating these figures for each industry period, alongside the main PPM measure.

These figures show that, for the network as a whole in 2011/12, 69.8% of trains arrived 'right time', compared with 91.6% meeting the PPM target. This is a high level of performance by historical standards and represents a significant improvement over the last five years, compared with 62.7% right time and 88.1% PPM in 2006/07. Overall, the average delay incurred by passengers is now around 2 minutes.

Results of the Spring 2012 National Passenger Survey just published by Passenger Focus showed very high levels of satisfaction with rail travel in this country (Great Britain). Nationally the percentage of passengers satisfied with their journey overall was 83 per cent, and for punctuality and reliability it stood at 81 per cent.

Right time information is generated by existing industry signalling systems, but these were not designed for precise monitoring of time-keeping, and there is some uncertainty over the accuracy of the data at individual operator level, so ORR is commissioning an urgent independent study into this.

In the light of that study, it is intended that right time information will be published at operator level from October 2012. In addition, Network Rail announced on 28 June that it was making available real time information on the reliability of individual trains, making it possible to analyse train performance at a far more granular level.

This will put our railway in the forefront of the transparency agenda, providing more information on punctuality and reliability for passengers than any other European country.

A good deal of information is also published on other key transport modes in this country, and the Coalition Government is keen to see further progress on transparency over time.

The Fuel Quality Directive (articles 1 and 7a(2)) requires that suppliers of fuels used in non-road mobile machinery should be obliged to reduce the lifecycle greenhouse gas intensities of the fuels they supply. Our preferred approach for implementing this requirement of the Directive is to amend the current RTFO Order 2007. However, given concerns about the sustainability of some biofuels, it is important that this change does not at this point result in an increase in the absolute volume of biofuel supplied in the UK.

Moreover, following concerns raised during consultation on engine compatibility and storage issues relating to biofuel used in non-road mobile machinery, we have, as announced previously, delayed making this change immediately so as to give industry and transport users time to prepare in terms of infrastructure and information. The requirement will come into force in April 2013. We understand the need for gas oil users to have accurate information on biofuel content. We hope the delay will give them time to engage with gas oil suppliers to ensure that biofuel-free gas oil will be available. DfT Guidance on improving the flow of information between non-road mobile machinery users and fuel suppliers is available at the following link:

This aims to ensure bus and coach passengers have rights similar to those using other modes of transport.

The Regulation, which mainly applies to bus and coach journeys over 155 miles (250km), lays out the responsibilities of operators and terminal owners in the case of delays, cancellations, accidents and other issues affecting passengers, including disabled passengers and passengers with reduced mobility.

The public consultation will offer the chance for those affected by this EU Regulation to put forward their opinions on domestic enforcement measures, the use of available exemptions and the designation of terminals served by long-distance services where specific assistance has to be provided to disabled people and people with reduced mobility.

I believe that the approach outlined in the consultation strikes the right balance between passenger protection and operator competitiveness. I look forward to receiving responses from interested parties.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/greening-20111107,34,"Mr Speaker with permission I should like to make a statement to update the house about the serious collision on the M5 motorway in Somerset on Friday evening on the 4th of November.

As the House will be aware, at approximately eight twenty-five on Friday evening a road traffic collision occurred on the M5 northbound in Somerset involving multiple vehicles. Some of these vehicles subsequently caught fire. The incident occurred between Junction 25 Taunton and Junction 24 Bridgwater North, approximately a third of a mile north of Junction 25. 

The emergency services and the Highways Agency responded to the incident immediately, and therefore a large number of emergency services vehicles and resources were able to attend the scene very quickly. At approximately 9pm Avon & Somerset Police declared a major incident based on the numbers of casualties and vehicles involved. 

Due to the nature of the incident scene it took some time to confirm exactly how many people and vehicles were involved in the collision.  Avon & Somerset Police have now confirmed that 37 vehicles were involved in the collision.  Tragically, 7 people lost their lives.  A further 51 people were injured and were either treated at Musgrove Park Hospital, Yeovil District Hospital or at the scene. 

I would like to again offer my - and I'm sure the House's - condolences to those who have lost friends or families in this horrific crash, as well our thoughts for those who have been injured.   The families of those who lost their lives are being supported by specially trained family liaison officers from Avon & Somerset police who will continue to work with them as long as they are needed.

Police investigations on the motorway were completed at ten past four on Sunday (6 Nov) and the scene was handed over to the Highways Agency and its contractors to begin repairs to the carriageway. The collision incident had caused a significant amount of damage to the highway; a stretch of 40 metres of road was damaged by fuel spillage from vehicles and a stretch of 60 metres was damaged by intense fire.   Two lanes of the southbound carriageway reopened yesterday at twenty past five, and following extensive resurfacing works, all lanes on the northbound carriageway reopened shortly before 9pm. The final remaining lane closure on the southbound carriageway was removed at twenty-five past nine last night, and the road is now running in both directions. 

The Roads Minister visited the scene of the incident on Saturday, and I was there myself yesterday.  I was tremendously impressed by the determination and professionalism of staff from the emergency services - police, fire crews and ambulance staff - local hospitals and the Highways Agency, working with real dedication in the most difficult of circumstances.  Our efforts to deal with the scene also involved the Environment Agency.  The way in which all these agencies were able to work together highly effectively was critical in ensuring those involved in the accident were helped and treated speedily.  I pay tribute to Assistant Chief Constable Anthony Bangham who, as Gold Commander, led those efforts. 

It was a harrowing and painstaking task for all concerned to deal with this incident and I would like to take this opportunity to massively thank all those involved for their efforts and bravery, including individual members of the public who were passing or near the incident (some of whom tried to help those trapped in vehicles).  I would particularly like to pay tribute to the local community, people and businesses, in and around Taunton.  From local people and hotels offering to accommodate relatives of those injured and members of the public offering support, to local off duty hospital staff turning up to their hospital to help provide care, it was humbling and inspiring to see how selflessly so many people were willing to offer their support to others who needed it. 

It would be a mistake at this very early stage to speculate about the causes of the collision.  Investigations into the cause of the crash are still at a very early stage.  To put that in context the recovery phase only just finished yesterday and it is only today that the investigation phase becomes the key focus.  While Avon and Somerset police have indicated that the presence of smoke on the carriageway is a significant line of inquiry, Assistant Chief Constable Bangham has been clear to me that, in his words to me earlier today, it is 'far too early' to jump to conclusions on the causal factors of this incident.  Our first priority now must be to ensure that the police are able to conduct a comprehensive and thorough investigation of the crash.

As I said, earlier today I spoke to the Assistant Chief Constable, Anthony Bangham, whose Avon and Somerset force are leading the ongoing investigation.   He told me that, given the large number of vehicles involved, the need to carefully look at the vehicles recovered and of course to talk to the many witnesses, it may be some weeks until the investigation can conclude on the cause or causes of this incident.  The police continue to appeal for witnesses, and I encourage anyone with any information to contact the police directly on 101 or by calling Crimestoppers on 0800 500 111. 

Mr Speaker I would like to emphasise to the House the extremely high priority that I attach to road safety.  The UK has a proud tradition as a world leader on road safety and that is a tradition that I am determined to continue.  Although the number of deaths and serious injuries on our roads has fallen dramatically over the last 20 years the horrific crash on Friday has reminded us of the terrible personal consequences of collisions for motorists and local communities.   This government published earlier this year a road safety framework which commits us to a range of activities which will help us to do even better in future. 

We will of course take full account of any lessons from this terrible collision in developing our future policies, and supporting the future safe travel of our people.  The safety of our roads also requires effective partnership working across a wide range of organisations - national and local government, police and emergency services and many others.  We need to work effectively together if we are to do the best job we can of ensuring people stay safe on our roads.   

Over the coming weeks, and going beyond any lessons that may be learned from this particular incident, I will be considering carefully our forward plans on road safety, to ensure that we have the right measures in place to deliver real and urgent progress with tackling the continuing blight of death and injury on our roads.   

I commend this statement to the House.

My Department received around 55,000 responses to the consultation and an analysis of them has been undertaken. I am being provided with detailed information on the issues raised. This will provide me with extensive evidence in respect of all the issues that will affect my decision.

A number of colleagues have understandably requested meetings regarding HS2 and I believe it is important that that there should be an opportunity for me to hear directly from MPs on their views about HS2. Given that the consultation has closed, due process means it would not be proper for me to respond to any substantive points that are made at this meeting.

I wish to place on record that I will be providing MPs with an opportunity for such a meeting. I have scheduled this meeting for 21 November and have written to all members to ask them if they wish to attend. The meeting will take place in the Palace of Westminster. In the interests of transparency, I will arrange for a transcript to be made available, as a public record of the proceedings.

The Triennial Review process has been established to continue our work ensuring accountability in public life by examining all NDPBs at least once every three years. I am announcing today the Triennial Review of HS2 Ltd. This review has two aims:

  * to provide a robust challenge of the continuing need for this NDPB - both its functions and form; and,
  * if it is agreed that it should remain as an NDPB, to review the control and governance arrangements in place to ensure that the public body is complying with recognised principles of good corporate governance.

The Triennial Review will build upon the internal review of the body conducted earlier this year.

I will announce the findings of the review later this year in line with the decision on the response to the consultation on high speed rail. 

If you would like further information, or to contribute to the review, please contact my Department or [highspeedrail@dft.gov.uk](mailto:highspeedrail@dft.gov.uk).

That is something we can and must tackle. The recent review by Sir Roy McNulty found scope to cut rail costs by 30 per cent - up to £1bn a year. My department is committed to working with the rail industry to develop a strategy to deliver a better value railway for the benefit of passengers, taxpayers and the wider economy.

In furtherance of that strategy, my Department has undertaken to develop and publish detailed proposals on delivering a sustainable railway including reform of Network Rail. I am today announcing my intention to publish a Command Paper that sets out those proposals early next year.

It will allow time for greater consideration of other issues central to the question of rail reform. This will also allow the Command Paper to properly reflect the consequences of my decision following our consultation on a national high speed rail network.

As part of the development of a comprehensive strategy for rail, and alongside the Command Paper, I also plan to consult on the scope to devolve responsibility for some rail passenger services in parts of England to sub-national bodies, and on issues relating to the review of fares and ticketing announced in May. In addition, the ORR expects to consult later this year on possible changes to its role, particularly in respect of future franchises.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/greening-20111121,38,"**The Secretary of State for Transport (Justine Greening):** On Christmas Day 2009 an attempted attack on Northwest flight 253 from Amsterdam Schiphol to Detroit was made using an explosive device concealed in the underwear of a passenger. The device had been constructed with the aim of making detection by existing screening methods extremely difficult and had not been picked up by airport security at any point throughout the passenger's journey.

The previous Government's response to this threat included introducing security scanners at UK airports. Security scanners were deployed at Heathrow and Manchester airports in February 2010. They were deployed at Gatwick airport a few months later, meaning that today scanners are in operation at three of the largest UK airports.

A public [consultation](http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/2010-23)on an interim code of practice for the use of security scanners began just before the General Election. After the election, my predecessor, Philip Hammond, extended the consultation to allow more time for people to respond. The consultation closed on 19 July 2010 and over 6,000 responses were received. These have been analysed and I can now announce how we intend to deploy security scanners in the future.

The overwhelming feedback from airports is that nearly all passengers accept the use of security scanners and find the process quick and convenient. Out of over a million scans the Government is aware of only twelve refusals. However, I recognise that some passengers have concerns about the use of security scanners and these concerns were reflected in the responses to the consultation.

The ways in which security scanners can be deployed have been restricted by European legislation. My predecessor asked the Transport Commissioner to bring forward proposals which relax these restrictions, and allow scanners to be used more flexibly. An outline package which would achieve this was presented to the European Aviation Security Committee in July and has now been agreed by the European Parliament.

Most responses to the consultation expressed discomfort with the idea of having an image of their body captured for analysis, and they indicated that - if selected for a security scan - they would prefer to opt for an alternative method of screening. I have considered this carefully. However, I have decided against it, on security, operational and privacy grounds.

Firstly, I do not believe that a 'pat down' search is equivalent in security terms to a security scan. The purpose of introducing security scanners in the first place was to protect the travelling public better against sophisticated terrorist threats: these threats still exist and the required level of security is not achieved by permitting passengers to choose a less effective alternative.

I have considered carefully whether there are alternative screening methods which might deliver equivalent levels of security to a security scan. A full private search - involving the loosening and/or removal of clothing in the presence of security staff in a private room - would deliver a reasonable level of assurance. However, I believe that this is likely to represent a greater intrusion of privacy than a security scan, and that nearly all passengers, if they fully understand the procedures, would be unlikely to opt for this alternative. It is also likely to be operationally disruptive to airports and other passengers. Appropriately trained security staff would need to be diverted from the main search area to undertake these searches, leading to increased costs and longer queues for everyone else. I do not, therefore, believe that this represents a viable way forward.

I am aware that the proposals recently agreed by the European Parliament include the right for passengers to request an opt out from scanning. The UK did not support these proposals when they were presented to the Aviation Security Committee. Given the security arguments against permitting such an opt-out, and the threat level that exists in the UK, the Government intends to use its powers under the Aviation Security Act to maintain the current position. Those passengers selected for scanning will therefore not be able to fly if they are not willing to be scanned.

The consultation also asked people whether they had any health concerns relating to the small doses of ionising radiation produced by some security scanners. Only a limited number of responses were received on this issue, but I recognise that it has continued to be a contentious issue. Last year, experts from the Health Protection Agency (HPA) conducted an official assessment of the x-ray backscatter scanner in use at some UK airports. The HPA found that the dose of ionising radiation received from deployed backscatter scanners is the equivalent to that received naturally through just two minutes of flying at high altitude.  
The European Commission has called for further expert consideration of the potential health risks from security scanners and has asked the European Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks to review the evidence. I look forward to the Committee's report and will consider it carefully before making decisions about which technologies should be deployed at UK airports in future.

However, it is right that the Government does what it can to address people's concerns wherever that is possible without compromising security. Therefore I can announce today that the Government intends to make further improvements to the privacy and data safeguards already in place for security scanners.

Software which automatically analyses images is currently in development. Where this technology has developed to a stage at which it passes rigorous Government testing, airports will be expected to deploy it when they renew or replace their equipment. This will mean that in the future images will no longer be seen by human reviewers. In addition, airports will also be required to undertake routine testing of hardware and software to ensure that they remain unable to copy, save, or otherwise transmit images. This will be verified by the Department's transport security inspectors.

I have also been considering whether security scanners should be rolled out more widely at UK airports. In principle, I believe that they should. My officials will work with the aviation industry to agree a risk-based approach to further deployments. However, I want to make sure that this is done in conjunction with the availability of enhanced screening technology with better privacy safeguards. The precise timing of further deployments will therefore be dependent on how quickly the new generation of security scanners is developed.

I have placed a copy of this statement, and the revised regulations on the use of security scanners at UK airports, in the Libraries of both Houses.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/greening-20111123,39,"**The Secretary of State for Transport (Justine Greening):** The publication of the [draft Civil Aviation Bill](/publications/civil-aviation-bill) today marks an important step in this Government's desire to put passengers at the heart of airport operations. The proposals are designed to modernise key elements of the regulatory framework for civil aviation in the UK, to enable the sector to increase its contribution to economic growth without compromising high standards.

Much of our aviation regulation is governed by 1980s legislation and needs to be updated. This draft Bill offers a package of reforms to make both regulation and the sanctions which support it flexible, proportionate, targeted and effective. It proposes removing unnecessary regulation and unnecessary intervention by central government. It devolves more responsibility to the independent specialist regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), while ensuring that the CAA is accountable and weighs the costs and benefits of its decisions. The draft Bill proposes that certain costs of regulating aviation should be moved from general taxation to the aviation industry.

Above all the draft Bill puts the consumer first. In the economic regulation of airports with substantial market power the CAA's primary duty will be to consumers; that is passengers and owners of cargo now and in the future. In addition the Bill gives the CAA a role in promoting better public information about airline and airport performance and about the environmental effects of aviation and measures taken to mitigate adverse effects.

Aviation enables people to travel for business, leisure and to visit friends and family; and it enables the rapid movement of goods to and from markets overseas. The Government wants to see a successful and competitive aviation industry. We are taking forward the work of the South East Airports Taskforce to improve our major airports within the constraints of existing runways. In the longer term, we have committed to producing a sustainable framework for UK aviation by 2013 which supports economic growth and addresses aviation's environmental impacts.

The draft Bill complements these policies. It is in three parts:

  * reforming the framework for airport economic regulation, following my predecessor's statements to the House on 3 March 2011 and 21 July 2010.
  * modernising the framework and functions of the aviation regulator, the CAA. Some of these measures stem from the independent strategic review of the CAA by Sir Joseph Pilling in 2008 and a consultation launched by the previous Government in 2009.
  * transferring certain operational aviation security functions to the CAA as part of wider work to improve aviation security regulation and deliver savings to general taxation. This proposal, mentioned in the July 2011 consultation document ""Better Regulation for Aviation Security"", would create a single regulator for aviation safety and security. The Secretary of State would remain responsible for aviation security policy and issuing aviation security Directions to the industry.

The Government has previously announced that legislation to implement airport economic regulation reforms would be introduced early in the next Parliamentary session. An opportunity has now arisen to introduce a Civil Aviation Bill into Parliament near the beginning of 2012. This would help ensure that the CAA does not have to set airport price controls for the 5-year period 2014-2019 under the existing system. I therefore intend to take up this opportunity. I still wish however to publish the draft Bill today to provide an opportunity, even though the time available is shorter than previously envisaged, for the Transport Committee and stakeholders to consider the proposals before they are introduced into Parliament.

It is possible that the scope of the Bill may be extended before it is introduced. One area which could be included is the reform of the Air Travel Organisers' Licence (ATOL), following the recently finished consultation on measures to protect consumers better in the 21st century holiday market and help create a more level regulatory playing field for businesses.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/greening-20111124,40,"The Secretary of State for Transport (Justine Greening): As the House will know, as part of the spending review settlement in October 2010, the then Secretary of State agreed to carry out an [independent review](/publications/strategic-roads-network) to examine whether Government has the right approach to operating, maintaining and enhancing the strategic road network.

Alan Cook, the non executive chairman of the Highways Agency has led this review and has today published his report. The report can be found at www.dft.gov.uk/publications/strategic-roads-network and an electronic copy has been lodged with the House library.

I am grateful to Alan and his team for producing such a comprehensive report and welcome its publication. The review report proposes some fundamental reforms to how the network should be managed, the role of Government in relation to the network and the future relationship between the Department and Highways Agency, including the Agency's status.

Although I must carefully consider the report before providing a full and informed response, I intend that my response be made as soon as possible, in order to enable the Agency and Department to move forward with certainty and confidence regarding any changes that are to be made. My response will therefore be completed in early 2012.

I recognise the potential benefits that greater financial autonomy may bring and I am also pleased to see that Alan is of the view that road users' needs are put at the heart of considerations around specifying future performance requirements for the network. This is an important step in ensuring the network meets the real needs of users as a key customer of the network.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/greening-20111128,41,"**Written statement by the Secretary of State**: The Secretary of State for Transport (Justine Greening): I wish to inform the House of the Government's intentions for the future of the search and rescue helicopter service in the UK. Following the cancellation of the SAR-H Private Finance Initiative in February, the Department for Transport will today publish a [notice](http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/uk-sar-helicopter-services) in the Official Journal of the European Union to commence procurement for a new UK wide service contract. 

My Rt. Hon Friend the Defence Secretary has agreed that the new contract will provide a search and rescue capability provided by civilian crews, enabling our Armed Forces to focus activity on their front line operations.

The Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force crews have shown great dedication and professionalism in delivering an exemplary search and rescue service for many years, and we owe them all great thanks for this. Looking forward, we are confident that, building on nearly 30 years of civilian service provided under contract to the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA), a fully civilian service will be able to maintain the same standards in the future.

This competition will procure a contracted search and rescue helicopter service for the whole of the UK, for a period of approximately 10 years. The Royal Air Force and Royal Navy will continue to provide search and rescue coverage until the replacement for this capability is in place, and it is my intention that the contract I let will require this to be the first part of the new service to become operational. This will ensure that the Ministry of Defence is able to meet its previously announced intention to withdraw from service and retire its fleet of Sea King helicopters by March 2016. The replacement for the capability currently provided by the MCA will follow on from this. This transition will ensure continuity of service.

Bidders for the future service will be able to put forward options which will utilise a mixed fleet of modern helicopters based on the capabilities required at each of the bases (such as range, carrying capacity and endurance). The services will be capable of delivery by different contractors providing complementary services.

The introduction of a modern fleet of fast, reliable helicopters will lead to major improvements in the capability available from the present mix of helicopters. Modern helicopters operating from 10 full-time bases can not only continue to meet all current service requirements but also provide faster flying times to a large part of the UK search and rescue region, as well as providing a more reliable service. This will therefore be reflected in the new contract.

It is my intention that search and rescue operations will cease at RAF Boulmer in 2015 and at MCA Portland when the interim arrangements that were announced in July expire. Other operations at RAF Boulmer will be unaffected by this.

Given the complexity of the issues that need to be considered by bidders during the procurement, I intend that this procurement will be undertaken using the competitive dialogue procedure. As far as is practicable however, I intend to run the competition using lean procurement principles during some stages of the procurement. This will, I hope, both expedite and simplify some stages of the procurement that would ordinarily be time consuming and costly for industry to participate in.

I expect to award a contract in early 2013 to give the future service provider time to mobilise the new capability.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/greening-20111129,42,"**The Secretary of State for Transport (Justine Greening)**: I am delighted to make this statement together with the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government about the importance of rail freight and the need for a network of [Strategic Rail Freight Interchanges](/publications/strategic-rail-freight-interchange) to support growth and create employment.

The UK logistics industry makes a significant contribution to the national economy, generating around £110 billion annually and employing more than two million people. The rail network transports over 100 million tonnes of goods per year. It is of strategic importance - rail freight delivers over a quarter of the containerised food, clothes and white goods, and delivers nearly all the coal for the nation's electricity generation. Rail freight has expanded by 60% over the last decade, and is expected to grow by a further 30% up to 2019.

Over recent years, rail freight has started to play an increasingly significant role in logistics and has become an important driver of economic growth. Given the right conditions, the Government believes that rail freight could make an even stronger contribution to the country's economic recovery.

The Government supports the transfer of freight from road to rail, where it is practical and economic to do so and fully recognises that rail freight can generate valuable benefits for society where it provides an alternative to road haulage. Rail can deliver goods quickly, efficiently and reliably and help reduce both congestion on our roads and levels of carbon emissions. To secure this longer-term growth and modal shift, rail needs to be able to compete effectively with the use of road by heavy goods vehicles, and it is significant that in recent years our major retailers have been keen to choose rail over road for the long distance carriage of goods to market.

However, this expansion in rail freight will be very difficult to deliver unless the industry is able to develop modern distribution centres linked into both the rail and trunk road system - 'Strategic Rail Freight Interchanges' (SRFI) - in appropriate locations to serve our major conurbations. To date, this has proved extremely problematical, especially in the South East where growing demand and increasing congestion on the road network are creating serious logistical challenges.

The Government believes that an expanded network of SRFIs, complemented by other freight interchanges and terminals, is needed to support longer-term development of efficient rail freight distribution logistics. Whilst SRFIs operate to serve regional and cross regional catchment areas, they are also key components in national and international networks. These networks are of strategic importance in facilitating links between UK regions and the European Union.

The Government is therefore taking measures to unblock the development of strategic rail freight interchanges and unlock the necessary private sector investment in such facilities. Pending the publication of the Department for Transport's consultation document on the National Networks National Policy Statement (NPS), a statement of current Strategic Rail Freight Interchange policy has been placed in the Libraries of both Houses and published on the Department's website. It may be used by the Infrastructure Planning Commission (IPC) in its decision making on the development consent applications for SRFI infrastructure that fall within the definition of a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project (NSIP) as defined in the Planning Act 2008.

In parallel, the Department has asked Network Rail to provide industry support to the development of a network of SRFIs, working collaboratively with the wider logistics industry to: speed up the delivery of SRFI sites to meet business demand; assist with funding mechanisms (potentially including Network Rail funding); and establish appropriate delivery vehicles for rail infrastructure elements of such proposals.

The Presidency will be seeking a Political Agreement on a Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a single European railway area (Recast). The European Parliament had its first reading of this proposal on 16 November. Many of the Parliament's amendments differed significantly from the Council's general approach text. Following discussion at the one Council working group meeting that took place following the first reading it is expected the Presidency will seek a political agreement, which incorporates only those amendments that do not alter the general approach, and thus will be acceptable to the UK.

The Council will be asked to reach a partial General Approach on a draft Regulation amending Regulation 3821/85 on recording equipment in road transport and amending regulation 561/2006. The UK supports elements of the proposal that aim to reduce burdens on business. I will want to resist provisions that might impose unnecessary burdens or additional costs on Government or Industry, including the proposal to ban operators from installing and calibrating tachographs in their own vehicles. I will be seeking to minimise the risks of increases in costs and burdens via future decisions taken by the European Commission ('the Commission') under a delegated or implementing act, by pressing for clearly specified constraints on the scope of proposed action.

The Council will be asked to reach a General Approach on a Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2008/106/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the minimum level of training of seafarers. Although we would question the merit of a European database of Seafarer Certification, we have negotiated important changes which would require the anonymisation of seafarer personal data to be a mandatory pre-condition of the obligation to transfer data. We have also negotiated changes to align the text more closely with the deadline for the implementation of the amendments to the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers to avoid placing additional burdens on EU Member States which would put our flags at a competitive disadvantage with other countries' flags.

The Council will be asked to reach a General Approach on a Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the accelerated phasing-in of double-hull or equivalent design requirements for single-hull oil tankers (Recast). The UK is in favour of the General Approach proposed for the draft recast of these regulations which brings European law in line with amendments agreed at the International Maritime Organization.

There will also be a Progress Report on a Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on Union guidelines for the development of the Trans-European Transport Network. The UK recognises that the TEN-T Network should be focused on projects that carry clear EU-added value and should be supported by guidelines on projects seeking EU funding. We do not support standards and requirements being expanded to the wider TEN-T Network on a mandatory basis. We believe that decisions on national projects to be prioritised for development and investment should remain with the Member States and the transport operators concerned. Furthermore, the UK is keen to ensure that this proposal does not impose any additional financial or administrative burdens.

The main items under Any Other Business include the Commission's presentation on its proposal for an Airport package, the Implementation and exploitation of European satellite navigation systems and the Connecting Europe Facility. The Commission will also provide information on the European Aviation Safety Management System and Air cargo security action plan.

The Polish Presidency will provide information on the Ministerial Conference on Eastern Partnership held in Krakow on 24-25 October 2011 and on the High Level Conference on the Implementation of the Single European Sky and its extension to third countries held in Warsaw on 28 November 2011.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/greening-20111214,45,"The Secretary of State for Transport (Justine Greening): Following the 2010 Spending Review the Government committed to a £1.5 billion programme of investment in major transport schemes promoted by local authorities, recognising the impact that such schemes can have on growth and the economy.

Our aim was to ensure that the programme of investment for the spending review period would be affordable, would promote growth and would achieve better value for money for the taxpayer. All local authority promoters with schemes already in the pipeline were challenged to improve their scheme design, reduce costs and secure a greater proportion of funding from local sources.

In February 2011 we confirmed funding for the first 9 of these schemes and announced an expanded Development Pool of 45 schemes that would be considered in more detail.

The local authority promoters of the Development Pool schemes were invited to submit revised funding bids in September 2011. Funding for 20 of these schemes was confirmed on 29 November as part of the Autumn Statement.

I am today announcing funding for a further 21 schemes as follows. These represent a mix of road and public transport schemes across England.

  * A684 Bedale-Aiskew-Leeming Bar Bypass
  * Bath Transportation Package
  * Beverley Integrated Transport Plan
  * Camborne-Pool-Redruth Transport Package
  * Chester Road (Birmingham)
  * Coventry-Nuneaton Rail Upgrade
  * Croxley Rail Link (Watford)
  * Darlaston (Walsall)
  * Elmbridge Transport (Gloucester)
  * Leeds Inner Relief Road Maintenance
  * Loughborough Town Centre Transport Scheme
  * Luton Town Centre Transport Scheme
  * Morpeth Northern Bypass
  * North Fringe to Hengrove BRT (Bristol)
  * Norwich Northern Distributor Road (NNDR)
  * Nottingham Ring Road
  * Pennine Reach (East Lancs Rapid Transit)
  * South Yorkshire Bus Rapid Transit Phase 1 (Sheffield/Rotherham)
  * Sunderland Strategic Corridor
  * Weston Package
  * Worcester Transport Strategy.

This is a major programme of investment. The schemes announced today will cost £854m with a DfT contribution of up to £586m in this spending review period and beyond. The total DfT contribution to all 41 schemes will be up to £972m, compared to the £1.575bn that was previously requested for these schemes prior to the spending review - a 38% reduction. This means that a far greater number of schemes can go ahead than would otherwise have been the case.

All the schemes announced will now be able to progress towards construction subject to securing any remaining necessary planning and statutory approvals and subject to confirmation of value for money where material changes to the scheme have been proposed.

We are not yet able to make decisions for a further four of the Development Pool schemes.

In two cases, we have not yet been provided with sufficient evidence to allow us to assess the schemes' value for money. These are the Leeds New Generation Transport (Trolleybus) and South Essex Rapid Transit schemes. In these cases the promoters will have until 31 March 2012 to provide the necessary additional information, and we will make decisions within two months of receipt.

The Waverley Link Road proposed by Rotherham Borough Council is opposed in its current form by Sheffield City Council, whose land is required for the proposed route. We recognise that there is a case for additional transport capacity in this area but the currently proposed scheme does not appear to be deliverable. We are inviting Rotherham to work with Sheffield and other stakeholders and to propose a resolution to the issue by 31 March 2012.

We recognise the critically important role that transport improvements could play in the regeneration of the Bexhill-Hastings area and the economic case underpinning the Bexhill-Hastings Link Road, though we are also aware of concerns regarding the proposed scheme, including its environmental impact.

Before we take a final decision on the scheme we want to be sure that it offers the best approach for regenerating the area and also to consider other transport options to achieve this, including local trunk roads such as the A21, A259 and local rail. We also want to consider whether further environmental mitigation measures could be deployed to address the impacts of the proposed Bexhill-Hastings scheme.

Over the next three months the Department will work alongside the scheme's promoters and other local and regional partners to gather further evidence on the optimal solution for the area. We would intend to make a decision swiftly thereafter.

Details of each of the schemes and the funding offered by the Government are available on the DfT website and will be followed by a more detailed document setting out the details of our decision making process, and information on our assessment of the schemes.

Following a detailed process of challenge, stakeholder discussion and public feedback, I am now pleased to announce the results.

Within the Road Transport Red Tape Challenge, my department put forward every secondary regulation relating to road transportation for public discussion - 415 in total. 376 of these are judged still to be live, and of these I propose to scrap, merge, simplify, amend or improve 142 - well over a third.

*Moved regulations will be finalised under a different section of the Red Tape Challenge.

Amongst the measures we are pursuing, we will be:

  * Scrapping the regulation requiring motorists to hold a paper counterpart to their driving licence by 2015 - saving drivers up to £8m;
  * Improving the regulation surrounding the notification process for vehicles that are not in use on the road (Statutory Off Road Notification or SORN). Once drivers have notified the DVLA that their vehicle is SORN, they will no longer have the burden of annual SORN renewal;
  * Only issuing hard-copies of V5C vehicle registration certificates for fleet operators when needed (with the potential to offer the same to private motorists);
  * Introducing a limited exemption from drivers' hours rules so that those who also drive as Territorial Army reservists in their own time can continue to do so.

The Challenge has also considered various administrative measures that are not based in legislation and has examined pieces of primary legislation that can be amended or simplified.

Other proposals include:

  * Removing the need for an insurance certificate. The Department for Transport will work with the insurance industry on removing the need for motorists to have to hold an insurance certificate.
  * Abolishing the requirement for drivers to prove they have insurance when applying for tax, meaning 600,000 more people will be able to tax their car online. This has been made possible by new checks of existing databases for insurance under new Continuous Insurance Enforcement rules. (The DVLA's records are now compared regularly with the Motor Insurance Database (MID) to identify registered keepers of vehicles that appear to have no insurance).
  * We will look at experience in other countries on driver Certificates of Professional Competence (CPC) - the qualification for professional bus, coach and lorry drivers. In particular, to see if we could remove the need for some sectors, such as farmers who drive stock to market, from needing a CPC.
  * Local Authorities will now have to ensure business interests are properly considered as part of any future proposed Workplace Parking Levy scheme. They must show they have properly and effectively consulted local businesses, have addressed any proper concerns raised and secured support from the local business community.
  * Abolishing the regulations on the treatment of lost property on buses. Bus companies currently have to wait 48 hours before they can throw away perishable items left on the bus.

The full list of 376 regulations, explaining what actions we are taking on each, is available on my Department's website at [http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/gov-20110520](/consultations/gov-20110520).

Overall, this represents an ambitious programme of deregulation, some elements of which will represent a major shift in the way my Department does business. I am pleased with the results of this section of the Red Tape Challenge and the deregulatory mindset it has helped foster. I look forward to similar outcomes from the ongoing rail and maritime theme and next year's examination of aviation red tape.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/greening-20120110,47,"> **The Secretary of State for Transport (Justine Greening)**: The consultation High speed rail: Investing in Britain's future was one of the largest national consultations ever undertaken by the Department for Transport. 54,909 responses were received, from individuals, businesses and organisations across the country. It is clear from the consultation that a national high speed rail network - High Speed 2 - generates strong feelings, both in favour and against the scheme.
> 
> Since becoming Secretary of State for Transport I have taken time to consider all aspects of the consultation proposals and the evidence arising from both consultation responses and further work undertaken or commissioned by my Department and HS2 Ltd. This statement summarises my decisions.
> 
> I have decided Britain should embark upon the most significant transport infrastructure project since the building of the motorways by supporting the development and delivery of a new national high speed rail network. By following in the footsteps of the 19th century railway pioneers, the Government is signalling its commitment to providing 21st century infrastructure and connections - laying the groundwork for long-term, sustainable economic growth.
> 
> High Speed 2 (HS2) is a scheme to deliver hugely enhanced rail capacity and connectivity between Britain's major conurbations. It is the largest transport infrastructure investment in the UK for a generation, and, with the exception of High Speed 1 (HS1), is the first major new railway line since the Victorian era.
> 
> The HS2 Y network will provide direct, high capacity, high speed links between London, Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester, with intermediate stations in the East Midlands and South Yorkshire. There will also be direct links to Heathrow Airport and to the Continent via the HS1 line. It will form a foundation for a potentially wider high speed network in years to come.
> 
> HS2 will be built in two phases to ensure that the benefits of high speed rail are realised at the earliest possible opportunity. The line from London to the West Midlands and the connection to HS1 are expected to open in 2026, followed, in 2032-33, by the onward legs to Manchester and Leeds and the connection to Heathrow. The capital cost at 2011 prices of building the complete Y network is £32.7 billion. At present values, it will generate benefits of up to £47 billion and fare revenues of up to £34 billion over a 60-year period.
> 
> The benefits of HS2 will extend beyond the network itself; links to current lines will enable direct trains to run to cities such as Liverpool, Newcastle, Glasgow and Edinburgh and, with long-distance services transferring to the new network, space will be freed up for new commuter, regional and freight services on other lines, opening up new opportunities for Britain's existing railways. Links to key urban transport networks, such as Crossrail, will help to spread the benefits further still.
> 
> HS2 is entirely consistent with the Government's objectives for carbon emissions. Electrified rail is a comparatively low-carbon mode of transport, especially with the continued decarbonisation of the grid. Speed increases power consumption, but also makes HS2 more attractive to those currently flying or driving. The faster journeys on HS2 - Edinburgh and Glasgow will be just 3.5 hours from London - could transfer around 4.5 million journeys per year who might otherwise have travelled by air and 9 million from the roads. HS2 will also create more rail capacity on existing conventional speed lines for freight - removing lorries from our busy trunk roads. HS2 is therefore an important part of transport's low-carbon future.
> 
> In securing these benefits for our country, I am committed to developing a network with the lowest feasible impacts on local communities and the natural environment. I have been mindful that we must safeguard the natural environment as far as possible, both for the benefit of those enjoying our beautiful countryside today and for future generations.
> 
> People living along the line of route highlighted particular concerns and provided constructive and thoughtful comments about the London to West Midlands route proposed at consultation. Following careful study by my engineers I can announce a package of alterations to further reduce the route's impacts. The changes mean that more than half the route will now be mitigated by tunnel or cutting and there will also be a reduction in the impacts on people and communities, ancient woodlands and important heritage sites.
> 
> The changes include: 
> 
>   * A longer, continuous tunnel from Little Missenden to the M25 through the Chilterns;
>   * A new 2.75 mile (4.4 km) bored tunnel along the Northolt Corridor to entirely avoid major works to the Chilterns Line and impacts on local communities in the Ruislip area;
>   * A longer green tunnel past Chipping Warden and Aston Le Walls, and to curve the route to avoid a cluster of important heritage sites around Edgcote; and,
>   * A longer green tunnel to significantly reduce impacts around Wendover, and an extension to the green tunnel at South Heath. 
> 
> The revised route offers considerable improvements to communities, with the number of dwellings at risk of land take almost halving and the number experiencing increased noise levels reducing by a third. Despite these improvements to limit the negative impacts of the line, HS2 will inevitably affect some homeowners, communities and businesses. To help those affected, we will bring in a package of measures, which are over and above what affected homeowners are already entitled to under law. These include:
> 
>   * A streamlined purchase scheme to simplify the statutory blight process for property owners;
>   * A sale and rent back scheme to give homeowners within the safeguarded area more flexibility;
>   * A streamlined small claims scheme for construction damage which will allow individuals and businesses who are entitled to compensation under existing law to claim it more quickly and simply;
>   * A package of measures to reinforce confidence in properties above tunnels. Homeowners will be offered before and after surveys, a thorough assessment of the impact of similar tunnels, an explanation of the measures that will be taken to prevent perceptible vibration impacts, financial compensation for the compulsory purchase of subsoil, and a legally binding promise that HS2 will be permanently responsible for resolving any related settlement or subsidence issues; and,
>   * A refreshed hardship-based property purchase scheme. 
> 
> Finally, we will work constructively with local authorities along the line of route to minimise the negative consequences of HS2 and maximise the benefits. 
> 
> In November I announced the Triennial Review of HS2 Ltd, and in making my decision I have accepted the finding that HS2 Ltd is the appropriate body to continue undertaking this work.
> 
> Today I have presented to Parliament a full account of my decisions titled High speed rail: Investing in Britain's future - decisions and next steps.

",Department for Transport,High speed rail,10 January 2012,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Justine Greening MP, Secretary of State for Transport.",The Rt Hon Justine Greening MP,2012-01-10,Written statement,"Rail, High speed rail"
http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/greening-20120110a,48,"**The Secretary of State for Transport (Justine Greening)**: This morning, I made a written statement to the House announcing my decision to give the go-ahead to High Speed 2--a national high-speed rail network. With the exception of High Speed 1--a 68-mile stretch of line--it will be the first major national railway line to be built in Britain since the Grand Central line opened to passengers in 1899. I would like to provide Members with further detail of the substance of, and rationale for, my decisions.

I weighed up the evidence after one of the largest public consultations in our history. We wrote to more than 172,000 people living or working near the proposed line from London to the west midlands, visited communities along the 140-mile route and held 41 days of roadshows attended by almost 30,000 people over the five-month consultation period. Almost 55,000 responses were received from individuals, businesses and organisations across the country representing a wide spectrum of views. Many of those views were expressed strongly both in favour of and against high-speed rail, and I have considered them carefully in making my decisions.

Since becoming Secretary of State for Transport, I have examined all the available evidence, including the work undertaken by my right hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr Hammond) and by the previous Labour Administration in developing the consultation proposals, the evidence submitted during the consultation, and the further work undertaken by my Department and HS2 Ltd. My decision had to consider not only the full environmental impact of HS2 but its benefits to our economy, jobs and our competitiveness not just today but decades into the future.

I also had to be clear about the implications of not investing in high-speed rail--about how it would affect our leading cities, and how that would affect the road network and aviation. Generating growth, helping people back to work and supporting Britain's companies and wealth creators so that they can compete and win in the global marketplace are at the top of the Government's priority list, and, from day one in office, the coalition has had a laser focus on investing in and modernising our country's transport infrastructure with unprecedented levels of investment.

When it came to HS2, I could have made the easy choice: I could have gone for the short-term option, relying on a patch-and-mend approach and leaving our rail networks overstretched, overburdened and less resilient. But let us be clear: the price for that would have been paid in lost business, lower growth, fewer jobs and more misery for passengers on a network without the capacity to cope. We would have failed future generations depending on us to create the prosperous country that they will want to live in.

Good government is about acting in the long-term national interest and about taking decisions, however difficult, to improve people's quality of life and the country's economic prospects not just for the next four or five years but for the next four or five decades. Our Victorian predecessors would have been immensely proud to see their railways providing massive benefit today --more than 100 years later--but as a result of today's announcement the railway revolution that they started is happening again. We are ready for a new chapter in Britain's transport history--one designed to boost our economy and our country just as the first coming of the railways or the motorways did for previous generations.

That is why I have given the green light to HS2. In spite of the challenges of rising demand, our railways have been a huge success since privatisation. Passenger demand is growing year on year, particularly in the inter-city market. I recognise, however, that further rounds of upgrades to our major north-south lines, even if they offer apparently good value for money, can only provide a short-term fix--one that is incapable of meeting the long-term challenge. In truth, they could add only limited further capacity; they could not offer the step change in performance that passengers wish and need to see.

What is more, upgrades would consign rail passengers and the vitally important rail freight industry to years, if not decades, of future engineering disruption, delay and unreliability--something that users of the west coast main line will remember only too well. The question, therefore, is not, ""Do we build new lines?"" but, ""What type of line should we build?"" And when we weigh up the economic and social rewards, there is only one answer: high-speed rail. A high-speed line will deliver £6.2 billion more in benefits to the country than a line running at conventional speeds, at an extra cost of only £1.4 billion. Therefore, by slashing journey times, as well as providing the step change in rail capacity that we need to keep the country moving, a high-speed line will give a return on the additional investment of more than four to one. A modern, reliable and fast service between our major cities and international gateways, as befitting the 21st century, will transform the way we travel, and promote Britain's economic and social prosperity.

HS2 will be built in two phases, to ensure delivery of its benefits at the earliest possible opportunity. Phase 1 will link London to the west midlands, as well as delivering a direct connection to the continent through the channel tunnel via High Speed 1. Even in the first phase, cities and towns off the HS2 network--such as Stockport, Warrington, Liverpool, Preston and Glasgow--will be served by trains able to use both HS2 and inter-city lines, saving over half an hour on journeys to London. Phase 2 will provide onward legs to Manchester and Leeds, with intermediate stations in the east midlands and South Yorkshire, plus a direct connection to our international hub, Heathrow airport. HS2 will also mean substantial time savings between Britain's cities, reducing Birmingham-to-Leeds journeys from two hours to just 57 minutes, and Manchester-to-London journeys from two hours eight minutes to only one hour eight minutes. Edinburgh and Glasgow will benefit from a three-and-a-half hour journey time from London, encouraging modal shift from short-haul flights to high-speed rail.

In delivering HS2, I look forward to working with the Scottish Government and others to identify and evaluate options for developing the high-speed network and further reducing journey times. However, I want to emphasise to the House that in making my decisions, I have been particularly mindful of our responsibility to safeguard the countryside and its wildlife, and to protect local communities as far as possible. I have worked hard to look at more tunnelling, to lower the route into cutting to reduce visibility, and to move the route away from homes wherever viable. I have looked hard at how we can better protect our landscape, our wildlife and our heritage. For that reason, my engineers have carefully re-examined the route in the light of all the evidence. I can therefore announce a package of alterations that I believe will significantly reduce the railway's impact.

Those improvements include a longer, continuous tunnel under the Chilterns from Little Missenden to the M25, and a new 2.75-mile bored tunnel along the Northolt corridor to avoid major works to the Chiltern line and impacts on local communities in the Ruislip area. Of the 13 miles through the Chilterns area of outstanding natural beauty, less than 2 miles will be at or above the surface. The rest will be in deep cutting or tunnel. There will also be a longer green tunnel past Chipping Warden and Aston le Walls, and another longer green tunnel to reduce impacts around Wendover, as well as an extension to the green tunnel at South Heath. There will also be a green tunnel past Greatworth. Those are just a few examples from the suite of improvements detailed in full in the Command Paper that I presented to the House this morning.

The changes will bring significant benefits to communities and the environment. Compared with the consultation route, there will be a more than 50% increase in tunnel or green tunnel, now totalling around 22.5 miles. In addition, around 56.5 miles will be partially or totally hidden in cutting, as a key way of helping to reduce noise in neighbouring communities, and 10 miles less track along viaduct or embankment. In all, that means that around 79 miles--more than half the route--will be mitigated by tunnel or cutting. The revised tunnel alignment through the Chilterns will avoid an important water aquifier--[Hon. Members: ""Aquifer.""]--aquifer--significantly reducing impacts on water. You see, Mr Speaker, I am always happy to listen to people when they see a better way of doing things.

There will also be a reduction in the impacts on ancient woodlands and heritage sites. Communities affected will benefit from the changes, with a near 50 % reduction in the number of dwellings at risk of land take, and the number of households experiencing noticeably increased noise levels reducing by a third, to just over 3,000 properties.

I have always been clear in my mind, however, that, whatever the mitigation measures, there can be little comfort to someone in knowing that the country will benefit enormously from HS2 when it is their house, or their business, that has to be knocked down to make way for it. The meeting that I had with MPs earlier last year allowed many of those representing communities along the proposed route to communicate the views of their constituents to me directly.

So, to help people, we will bring in a package of compensation measures over and above those that affected homeowners are already entitled to under law. These include: a streamlined purchase scheme to simplify the statutory blight process for property owners; a sale and rent back scheme to give homeowners within the safeguarded area more flexibility; a streamlined small claims scheme for any construction damage; and a package of measures to reinforce confidence in properties above tunnels.

Homeowners will be offered before and after surveys, a thorough assessment of the impact of similar tunnels, an explanation of the measures that will be taken to prevent perceptible vibration impacts, financial compensation for the compulsory purchase of subsoil, and a legally binding promise that HS2 will be permanently responsible for resolving any related settlement or subsidence issues. There will be also be a refreshed hardship-based property purchase scheme, and, finally, we will work constructively, and in a structured way, with local authorities along the line of route to minimise the negative consequences of HS2 and maximise the benefits.

Having made the decision to press on with HS2, my intention is to drive it forward as fast as is practicable, so that we can gain from its benefits as early as possible and end the unwelcome uncertainty for those affected. A key part of this will be to engage fully and actively with organisations, communities and individuals along the whole route of the Y network. People presented legitimate concerns in the consultation and, even though we have made significant improvements, I am keen to work hard with local communities so that as many concerns as possible are properly addressed.

I have instructed HS2 Ltd to undertake a range of activities to prepare for and deliver both phases of the network. It is my intention to introduce a hybrid Bill in the House by the end of 2013, including a detailed environmental impact assessment to provide the necessary powers to construct and operate the line from London to Birmingham. I have instructed HS2 Ltd to deliver this project at pace, but within milestones that will stand the test of time and with regular reporting to me on progress. The Major Projects Authority, which this Government launched last March to improve the performance of major Government projects in delivering on time and in budget, will provide critical support and oversight.

This spring, we will consult on the draft directions for safeguarding the proposed route from London to the west midlands, as well as separately consulting on detailed compensation proposals. I aim to bring final safeguarding directions and an agreed compensation policy into effect later in the year. In March this year, HS2 Ltd will advise me on the route and station options to Manchester and Leeds, and in autumn 2012, we will start an engagement programme on a preferred route to discuss local views.

I warmly welcome the political consensus on HS2, on the basis that it will help to ensure that the planning and construction of this transformational scheme are carried through to completion. HS2 matters to the long-term success and prosperity of the whole of Britain. It will help to create jobs, support growth and regenerate our regions. It will better connect communities and improve people's opportunities, and, with its potential to attract people and freight on to trains and away from long-distance road journeys and short-haul flying, combined with the increasing decarbonisation of the grid, HS2 will be an important part of transport's low-carbon future.

Britain has faced such challenges before. The Victorian railway pioneers had the vision to build a rail network that has promoted growth and created jobs for more than a century. Those innovators transformed this country's fortunes. Our industries flourished, our exports multiplied, and our economy grew wealthy. Half a century later, another generation had the vision to start building the motorway network. Post-war planners developed the motorway network, connecting major cities and transforming the capacity of our road network. Half a century on again, we now need to do for our Victorian railway what previous generations did for our road network. The time has come again to seize the moment, to be ambitious and to show the world that this is a can-do country. The lesson from history--and the lessons from our global competitors--is that no matter how hard times are, we cannot stop planning for the future or investing in our infrastructure if we want Britain to flourish. HS2 will be the backbone of a new transport system for the 21st century, offering the vital capacity that we need to compete and grow as a country. It will transform the economic shape and balance of our country, linking our major cities to a level previous generations could only dream of. By backing HS2, this Government are backing Britain, and I commend this statement to the House.

Spend for the period 1 April 2010 - 31 March 2011 was £3.8m. This includes £0.7m of spend during the previous administration. In 2009-10 the spend was £6.7m. This represents a 44% reduction in the amount departments spent on the ministerial car service compared to the previous financial year.

Costs from 1 April -12 May 2010 relate to the previous administration.

From 12 May 2010, the costs incurred by non-Cabinet Ministers while new arrangements for a Ministerial Car Pool were introduced include unavoidable costs associated with contractual termination notice periods. To reduce the cost of the Government Car Service to taxpayers, the Ministerial Car Pool was introduced in September 2010 and, from that date, replaced the allocated service for non-Cabinet Ministers in line with the Ministerial Code published in May 2010.

The second table highlights the reduction in the number of Ministers who have access to a GCDA allocated car and driver. The number has reduced from 78 to 13.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/greening-20120201,50,"**The Secretary of State for Transport (Justine Greening):**

  1. Maintaining vehicle road worthiness and servicing is one of the most important costs of running a car for most motorists.  I am today announcing the Government's intention to work with industry and motoring organisations to improve the motorist's confidence and experience when they have to take their car, motorcycle or other private vehicle to a garage.

  2. Motorists are generally not experts in the mechanics, electronics or component parts of their vehicles -- what matters to them is that the vehicle is safe to be on the road, that they are paying a reasonable price and that what they are paying for is necessary work carried out to a good standard. Motorists want reliable servicing and MOTs from garages they trust and it is in the interests of reputable garages to deliver to a high quality.

  3. Almost every motorist has to visit a garage or other authorised testing station at least once a year for their vehicle to undergo an MOT test -- and for many people, that minimum statutory spot check of a vehicle's roadworthiness is either combined with an annual service or leads to repairs and further work. Each year in Great Britain some 35 million MOTs take place at some 21,000 authorised premises -- the annual cost to motorists of the test alone is in the region of £1 .5 billion. The UK car service and repair sector is worth around £9 billion per year to the GB economy.

  4. The garage sector is regulated in several ways. The sector has to comply with business laws and consumer protection legislation. The MOT scheme is regulated by the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) of the Department for Transport. Self-regulation has an important role to play also. For example, around 6500 garages self-regulate their customer service through the Motor Codes Ltd Code on Service and Repair which has full approval status under the OFT Approved Codes System. And nearly 1000 garages have been accredited with the BSI Kitemark scheme for automotive services.

  5. The package of measures I am announcing today does not duplicate these existing controls and arrangements. But they will add value for the motorist and enhance their experience when having to deal with garages whether for an MOT test or more generally.

  6. I am taking two immediate steps today. Firstly, having listened closely to the very many views put forward and considered the available evidence, I have decided that I am not going to carry out further work in relation to relaxing the first test date or the frequency of testing. 

  7. Secondly, I am publishing for the first time today information gathered by VOSA about the standards of MOT testing. VOSA's MOT compliance survey 2010/11 showed that, despite large parts of the MOT test being subjective, 88% of testers were applying correct and consistent standards. There were 12% of testers who had their overall assessment of the vehicle's roadworthiness challenged by VOSA, suggesting there is still room for improvement. Publication of this data represents a considerable increase in transparency on the accuracy of MOT tests.

  8. VOSA already carries out targeted work to improve this figure.  However, I want to go further and make it easier for consumers to take action if they have not received the service they need from MOT testers. Further short term steps I am therefore taking are to: 

    * engage the key motoring organisations in surveying their members over the next few months to determine the most significant and frequent problems they encounter at garages, how transparent and consistent charging and service standards are and what examples of best practice customer service they have experienced - and to publish their results.

    * Identify and work with organisations able to carry out mystery shopper exercises that could supplement those which VOSA already carry out as part of their targeted supervision of the scheme.

    * work with the Motorists' Forum to establish a sub-group to bring together a broad range of relevant motoring and industry organisations, such as the MOT Trade Forum, to help deliver the package that follows;

  9. Over the next six months my Department will carry out the following actions: 

    * so that consumers can be confident that the garage they choose has signed up to deliver to the highest standards, we will work with the industry and stakeholders to encourage much wider adoption of existing Codes (such as that provided through the SMMT and Motor Codes Ltd) and to develop those Codes to include MOT testing services.  Our ambition is that it should be the norm for garages to comply with such Codes. 

    * in order to make more information available to help motorists know how the scheme is supervised, which garages perform well and which less well, we will review the MOT data gathered by VOSA and - informed by the surveys above - further improve transparency.

    * we will also work with industry, motoring organisations and others to make it easier for consumers to give feedback on their experiences of garages in a transparent way that others can view, and to boost awareness of existing consumer feedback tools.

    * we will help motorists to spot clocked vehicles by arranging for MOT test certificates to show mileage information for the last three years, and encouraging car buyers to check the full MOT history of vehicles by accessing online the authoritative MOT database.

    * to help motorists know how long wear and tear items such as brakes and tyres are likely to last after an MOT test, we will work with the MOT trade initially to consider whether to adjust the MOT technical test standard. 

  10. The Government intends to develop with the Motorists' Forum sub-group a robust means by which we can measure consumer confidence over time across all garage services.

  11. I see the above package of measures as an important element in our overall road safety policy, alongside delivering increased confidence and value for money for motorists having their vehicles MOT tested or serviced. I expect more ideas and measures to develop once the Motorists' Forum subgroup is established, and there will be opportunities for all interested parties to contribute to the debate.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/greening-20120228,51,"**The Secretary of State for Transport (Justine Greening):** I would like to inform the House that the Invitation to Negotiate for the procurement of rolling stock and associated depot facilities has today been issued by Crossrail Limited.

Together with the Mayor of London, my co-sponsor on the Crossrail project, I welcome this major milestone in Crossrail's journey from inception to reality.

Crossrail will create vital new transport infrastructure to support economic growth. It will deliver faster journey times and a 10% increase in the capacity of London's rail network.

Crossrail Limited is inviting suppliers to design, manufacture, finance and service around 60 new trains and build a depot at Old Oak Common in West London. These new trains will provide around 27,000 seats, reducing congestion and bringing an additional 1.5 million people within 45 minutes of London's major business centres.

Honourable members will recall that the previous Secretary of State for Transport committed to consider any relevant findings of the Government's Growth review as part of this and other large scale procurements. Honourable members will also be aware that My Right Honourable friend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, published the National Infrastructure Plan in November 2011 and included a package of measures to reform public procurement in the Autumn Statement.

My department has been working with colleagues across Whitehall, and suppliers and delivery bodies to implement these recommendations. Across the transport sector we want to improve dialogue with suppliers and increase the long-term visibility of forthcoming contracts in order to strengthen the capability of the UK supply chain.

In respect of Crossrail, reflecting its stage in the procurement process, this Invitation to Negotiate is a clear example of how, working in partnership with the Mayor and Crossrail Limited, we are already adapting our approach:

First, the Invitation to Negotiate includes requirements for 'responsible procurement'. This means that bidders are required to set out how they will engage with the wider supply chain and provide opportunities for training, apprenticeships, and small and medium size businesses within their procurement strategy. Bidders are also required to establish an appropriate local presence to manage the delivery of the contract.

The Mayor and I are also keen to understand and communicate the benefit of this contract to the UK economy; bidders are being asked, in the Invitation to Negotiate, to specify from where each element of the contract will be sourced. This is not an assessment criterion in the decision process however the successful bidder will be required to report against their proposed estimates.

Second, Crossrail Limited, which has already developed a reputation for being an industry leader in this field, will ensure that, going forward, this procurement is efficient and effective and does not involve unnecessary costs for the bidders.

In addition, this contract will provide a significant element of public investment, alongside private finance, optimising the balance of public debt and transfer of risk to the private sector.  This approach will help ease the costs of debt repayments to the public purse, as well as reduce bidders' requirements to raise debt and equity, while still transferring significant risk to the private sector ensuring that we secure value for money. First and foremost, the successful bidder must be able to deliver the right trains and depot facilities.

Above all, I want this procurement to be a fair process that provides best value for money for the UK taxpayer and future fare-payers and high quality, reliable trains for the millions of people that will use Crossrail services every week.

Four bidders will be receiving the Invitation to Negotiate having performed strongly at the pre-qualification stage and I look forward to a highly competitive process. The contract will be awarded in Spring 2014.

## Opening remarks

With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a statement on railways.

Our rail network matters… to our quality of our life… our national wellbeing… and our country's future prosperity.

For this Government it's a simple equation… good transport equals good economics.

But, too often, we find ourselves frustrated and disappointed when the cost, punctuality or comfort of rail travel don't come up to scratch.

I believe that Government and the rail industry can and must do more for passengers and for taxpayers.

Of course, investment has a huge part to play.

That is why we've been investing in our transport infrastructure… because that's one of the best ways to support business, generate growth and create jobs.

And, for rail, that has meant the biggest modernisation programme since the Victorian age with £18 billion invested in this spending period.

But Mr Speaker, it's not enough only to invest in them… it's also vital to make sure they are set up for success.

So today, I am setting out our plans to do precisely that, with the publication of our Rail Command Paper, entitled 'Reforming our Railways: Putting the Customer First'.

## Efficiency Gap

Mr Speaker, I have taken the 'Ronseal' approach to the name. This strategy will do what it says on the tin: put the customer first.

The hallmarks of our railway must be high standards **and** low costs… a railway that offers the best services **and** the best value.

That means a rail network which is efficient, effective and affordable.

Nevertheless, in his Rail Value for Money Study, Sir Roy McNulty concluded that our railways are among the most expensive in Europe… and that's in spite of the strong and steady growth in the number of passengers using them.

Sir Roy identified inefficiencies worth £2.5 to £3.5 billion-a-year… and the people picking up the tab for this costly efficiency gap are passengers and taxpayers.

So reform is long overdue.

**Passengers** rightly want to know that we have a plan to end the era of inflation-busting fares seen over recent years.

And **taxpayers** rightly want to see railway subsidy reduced to help us tackle the fiscal deficit.

My message to everyone today is very clear. The days of spiralling and unjustified rail costs are coming to an end.

Under this Government, the rail industry will only be able to compete for future investment if its long-term cost issues are addressed, and if it can earn the right to grow.

I'm pleased to say that Network Rail is already due to deliver £1.2 billion of efficiency savings by 2014 with at least a further £600 million expected by 2019.

But, as Sir Roy so clearly set out, we need to go further. The railway **as a whole** needs to become less dependent on Government subsidies. That's why we want the industry to fully close the efficiency gap of £3.5 billion per year identified by Sir Roy, by 2019.

Managing and reducing costs. Balancing budgets. Targeting investment where it can drive long-term growth and jobs, delivering more capacity and better service for the investment that goes in.

## Government's response - the Command Paper

The time is right for reform. I believe we are in a good position to build on recent efficiency gains to further improve the performance of the industry - and to improve the passenger experience.

The programme of work that will decide rail outcomes and funding for the five-year period from 2014 is now well under way, and this sits alongside a period when we will see the biggest round of re-franchising since the privatisation of the industry. Both represent a further opportunity to really change our railways for the long-term better.

Today's Command Paper sets out our ambitions for Britain's railways and the agenda for change that both Government and industry will follow in the months and years ahead.

By reforming the industry, we will achieve substantial savings. Those savings will allow us to cut and then abolish above-inflation rises in average regulated fares… and it will ease the burden of the railway on the broader public purse.

Taken together with my decision to limit the most recent increase in regulated fares I believe this will have a positive long-term impact on household budgets.

## Closer working between industry parties

For reform to really be effective there needs to be closer collaboration between the infrastructure managers, in other words Network Rail, and those who provide passenger services, generally the Train Operating Companies.

Only through better joint working will we reduce costs and improve the customer experience.

The industry is already pushing for better alignment between track and train.

We look to them to bring forward partnerships equipped and incentivised to deliver not just better services, but also better value.

The rail industry, led by the Rail Delivery Group, has also declared itself willing and able to respond to the strategic and operational challenges that the railway faces.

Such leadership across the industry will be essential if we are to get the most out of our reforms.

## Franchises, fares and ticketing

Rail franchises will be reformed with greater transparency around costs and efficiency… again to ensure best value for fare-payers and taxpayers.

Franchises will be longer, giving train operators the flexibility they have been asking for, more time to make the biggest investments - to deliver what passengers want, within a sustainable budget.

We will also move to a more transparent, modern and flexible approach to fares and ticketing. We are launching a consultation today to take views on how these key aims can be achieved.

It's time to bring fares out of the 1970s and into the 21st Century.

We will expand smart ticketing to give more passengers the kinds of benefits that travellers in the capital already enjoy with Oyster cards.

Working with industry we will roll out smartcards across England and Wales and across different operators, increasing convenience for passengers.

Smartcards are also pivotal to introducing a more flexible system tailored to customers, with a wider choice of tickets and season cards, recognising the reality that not all journeys take place five days a week during rush hour.

## The rail workforce

Mr Speaker, If we duck the reform challenge then it won't just be rail users and the public purse that pay the price… ultimately the rail industry and the wider economy will suffer too.

So we want everyone working in rail, be it management or front-line, to help make these reforms work.

By reducing costs and increasing demand set alongside this Government's huge investment in railways there is genuine potential to boost jobs across the industry.

## Network Rail

It's important to reform governance too.

Network Rail is giving greater decision-making powers to its regional Route Directors, making it more responsive to local conditions and increasingly focused on day-to-day train operations at the local level.

We welcome Network Rail's efforts to find new and more efficient ways of managing its assets, including long-term concessions to third parties for the management of parts of the network.

Network Rail is rightly taking steps to reform corporate governance… including its management incentives package… so that it is more accountable to passengers and freight customers.

I would also like to welcome its sensible decision - to be announced shortly - to voluntarily appoint a Public Interest Director, who will ensure the concerns of taxpayers are fully reflected at board level and help strengthen the role of members.

## Decentralisation - local authorities and the ORR

Mr Speaker, it's time to give communities more control over local services.

So today we are also consulting on devolving decisions about the railway to sub-national bodies.

And our joint consultation with the Office of Rail Regulation on a greater role for the ORR in regulating passenger franchises closed recently. With a smarter regulatory approach, our aim is to remove Government from day-to-day industry involvement by adopting a more unified regulatory structure for the railways.

We will publish our conclusions in due course.

## Concluding remarks

Mr Speaker,

Facing up to reality… saving farepayers and taxpayers £3.5 billion a year… reforming our railways… putting the customer first. That's what this Command Paper is all about.

And, by working together on this package of reform, I believe industry, regulator and Government can generate the savings and the change we need.

Lower costs, better services and ticketing offering greater choice and flexibility.

A rail industry built to last because it's efficient, effective and affordable.

That's what this Command paper will deliver and I commend it to the House.

In line with my duties under the GLA Act 1999, and after formally consulting the Mayor, I am therefore today reconfirming the GLA Transport Grant for 2012-13 at £2.829 billion. This grant is provided by the Government to Transport for London to deliver transport services and investment in the capital, including London Underground.

In line with my [predecessor's 20 October 2010 letter to the Mayor ""Spending Review 2010: TfL funding agreement""](/publications/hammond-20101020) and the Chancellor's fare announcement on 20 October 2011, £881 million of this grant is designated an Investment Grant. This will support the delivery of vital tube upgrades, providing journey time savings and extra capacity for passengers, as well as investment in station upgrades and other projects, as set out in Annex B of the 20 October letter.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/greening-20120326a,55,"**The Secretary of State for Transport (Justine Greening):** The Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) made proposals to me, following consultation, for the level of penalty charges and associated fees that should apply for civil contraventions of parking and other traffic management measures in Traffic Regulation Orders and Notices made for defined Games purposes on the Olympic Route Network (ORN) and elsewhere in England.  I am today announcing my decision on these proposals under the provisions of the London Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Act 2006.

The ODA proposed that in most locations the normal level of penalties and fees should apply, and that in all places the normal discounts and surcharges for early and late payment should apply. However they also proposed that in order to help secure a high level of voluntary compliance with the temporary parking and other traffic management measures essential to the Games' success increased penalties of £200 should apply on the ORN, and in two of the Residents and Business Parking Protection (or 'LATM&P') Areas being established around the Games venues - around the Olympic Park and in the Greenwich River Zone.  In addition ODA proposed a higher vehicle pound release fee of £300 in the same two areas.

I have decided not to approve higher than normal penalties and fees on the ORN and in these areas, and to require all penalties and fees to be set at normal levels. I endorse the importance of securing a high level of compliance with the temporary traffic management measures, for the benefit of both the Games and local residents and businesses.  However I am not persuaded that a higher level of penalties and fees is an essential addition to the strategy of communication and advice to residents, businesses and motorists about the measures and their enforcement that is already well underway, supported by plans for effective on-street enforcement activity during the Games, including tow-away resources. I consider that increased penalties and fees would be an unnecessary burden in a challenging economic climate when we are already asking businesses and commuters to consider making significant changes to their travel behaviour during the Games.

My decision concerns penalties for contraventions of new temporary measures implemented for the Games.  It is consistent with that taken by the Mayor of London on 15 March not to approve temporary increases in the penalties and fees for contravention of existing measures in Traffic Regulation Orders on the ORN in London and in the same Residents and Business Parking Protection Areas.

I am placing in the Libraries of the House a copy of ODA's table showing their proposals and the normal penalties and fees applicable in different locations.

This is an important next step in our aspiration for a truly national high speed network, as set out in our Programme for Government. Phase 2 of High Speed Two will spread the benefits of high speed rail further across the country, increasing capacity and enhancing connectivity by extending high speed rail lines to Leeds and Manchester and connecting other major conurbations in the North and in Scotland through seamless transition onto the existing network.

In fulfilment of its remit, HS2 Ltd's advice will include options for stations in Manchester, Leeds, South Yorkshire, the East Midlands and at Heathrow Airport, as well as advice on the case and potential locations for additional stations. It will also cover the impact of Phase 2 of the network in releasing capacity on the Midland and East Coast main lines, as well as further extending the benefits of released capacity within the West Coast corridor.

I will consider this advice objectively and in detail over the coming months, and I intend to publish it in the autumn together with a Government response setting out initial preferred route and station options. An important part of this process will be to consider the views of delivery partners in the cities where HS2 stations may be located, including any underpinning evidence which they have identified. Understanding local desires and plans for development will be crucial in helping me reach initial preferences for station locations. I am particularly keen to ensure that the network best supports the economic potential of the cities and regions it serves, through well-integrated station locations that build on local and regional plans.

Minimising the risk of blight is a serious consideration, and it is for this reason that I expect to publish HS2 Ltd's advice once I have reached a view on routes and station options. Publishing a detailed range of possible options without an indication of the Government's preferences would generate unnecessary and harmful blight across areas that ultimately might never be affected by the lines. I will be working with national environmental stakeholders to discuss key sustainability issues and how best to consult on lines of route going forward to help meet the needs of different stakeholders and the public.

Following publication, the input of interested parties, including MPs and their constituents, will be valuable to help further develop the proposals that will go forward for subsequent formal public consultation. Only once a full public consultation has been launched and completed will any decisions be reached.

When preferred route options are published in the autumn we will consult on and introduce an Exceptional Hardship Scheme to assist property owners impacted by the proposals. Further, in order to reduce uncertainty for those affected by the proposals, and to ensure that the benefits for passengers and business of a national high speed rail network are realised as soon as possible, I have asked my officials to explore options for bringing forward formal public consultation on Phase 2 of High Speed 2 to 2013, and I will set out my proposed timetable later this year.

We also committed to undertake further work to evaluate the potential impact of these measures before final decisions were made. This work, undertaken in conjunction with the aviation sector and the Government's security experts, led to a revised set of planned airspace restrictions which were announced on 19 July 2011.

Since July 2011, the Government, with the assistance of the Civil Aviation Authority, has been preparing the necessary Statutory Instruments to give effect to the planned airspace restrictions. These detailed Regulations have now been signed on behalf of the Secretary of State for Transport and will enter into force on 1 June 2012. NATS, the UK's en-route air traffic service provider and publisher of the UK's aeronautical information, will be publishing the details of these Regulations on 17 May 2012 in its next Aeronautical Information Circular. In addition, full details of the planned airspace restrictions, including maps, can be [found on the Airspace Safety Initiative web site](http://www.airspacesafety.com/Olympics).

In total there are 15 sets of Regulations, three covering the London area (a restricted zone for the main Olympics and prohibited zones for the Olympics and for the Paralympics), five covering the Olympic football tournament stadia at Old Trafford, Coventry, Newcastle, Glasgow, and Cardiff, and the remainder protecting the sailing venue at Weymouth, rowing at Egham and Eton Dorney, the road cycling events at Leatherhead and Brands Hatch, the canoeing events at the Lee Valley White Water Centre and the mountain bike racing at Hadleigh Farm in Essex.

Following extensive engagement with the aviation community, the Regulations have been designed to minimise, where possible, their impact on aviation business, while ensuring the safety and security of the Games. They also provide specific exemptions for aircraft such as those operated by the Police or emergency medical services to enter the protected airspace, and for the Olympic Broadcasting Service to operate over the venues. We do not expect that any airports will need to close as a result of the planned measures, and there should be little or no impact on scheduled air services.

The Government's paramount objective is the delivery of a safe and secure 2012 Games for all, and the airspace restrictions will help to provide this whilst minimising the impact on the aviation community, so far as possible. However, the Government reserves the right to implement additional airspace security measures should the need arise.

These references would have been made in the context of the economic regulation of these airports under the 1986 Act before the expiry of their current price controls on 31 March 2014.

The Civil Aviation Bill is proposing to remove the Competition Commission reference from the price review process permanently and replace it with a licensing and appeals regime. This will enable proportionate and accountable regulation, and will give airlines and airports a new right of appeal which the aviation sector have not had before - modernising the airport regulatory framework and putting in place a more flexible and responsive regime for the future.

The Civil Aviation Bill has already made significant progress through Parliament, having successfully concluded Report stage in the House of Commons, and will shortly continue its passage through the House of Lords.

In light of this, it would be unrealistic to ignore that a new regime is on the near horizon which will form the basis for the next regulatory settlement due to come into effect on 1 April 2014. Progressing with the mandatory reference under the existing legislation is likely to introduce unnecessary costs and uncertainty into the process for the CAA, the Competition Commission, and the aviation sector, in a manner that would undermine the Government's objective of reducing unnecessary regulation. I have therefore decided to remove the mandatory Competition Commission references for price controls at these airports now.

The directions that I am issuing follow an informal consultation between 19 January and 29 February 2012 with industry and careful consideration of their responses. I am also publishing today [my letter to industry setting out my response to the issues raised in that consultation and my letter to the CAA](/publications/greening-20120516a).

This will build on the evidence provided in Alan Cook's report on the efficiency savings which have been made in the regulated utilities, and will test whether similar savings can be made through a different structure for managing the road network. The study will develop options for bringing more private sector involvement into the strategic road network, generating increased investment and driving further efficiencies in the network.

  * [Roads Reform - A Fresh Start for the the Strategic Road Network: The Government Response and Feasibility Study Terms of Reference, 24 May 2012](/publications/roads-reform/)

Nevertheless, we do not need to wait for the conclusions of the feasibility study before making progress on a specific set of reforms as recommended by Alan Cook, which are both worthwhile in their own right and essential precursors to any future structural reform.

My announcement today constitutes the first stage in an ambitious integrated programme for reforming the road network to ensure that ultimately we deliver a more effective and efficient strategic road network, which enhances the experience of motorists and puts the road users and communities which rely on this network at its very heart.

I have carefully considered Alan's recommendations and solutions and my response sets out how the Government intends to take these forward in parallel with the feasibility study. I am accepting, in detail or in principle, many of the actions which Alan recommends that I or the Board of the Highways Agency should take. At this stage, the area where I am not progressing Alan's recommendation is on the question of changing the status of the Agency within the public sector. I do not propose to make decisions on the Agency's status ahead of the feasibility study concluding and the Government taking decisions on the future reform of the roads network.

In my response to Alan's report, I set out a programme of work to transform the Agency into a best in class executive agency by:

  * Delivering a long term strategy and setting an outcome performance specification for the strategic road network, providing far greater clarity about what Government wants, as well as a basis for consistent and transparent challenge to the Highways Agency to deliver against this specification.
  * Championing the road user. I am determined to ensure that the voice of the user is listened to and championed. I will be bringing a stronger 'consumer focus' to the Department's role, by developing our ability to test and understand the views and concerns of users and to respond to those through the setting of the performance specification.
  * A much smarter approach to planning through the production of route based strategies. These documents will set out investment plans to inform our decisions for the next spending review and will support much greater participation in planning for the network from local and regional stakeholders.
  * Work towards smarter financial relationships with Government .We are not accepting in full Alan's recommendation about funding certainty and ending annuality, but we do propose to work closely with the Highways Agency and HM Treasury to consider the evidence for embedding greater certainty and flexibility into the funding regime of the strategic road network. This will help to inform any future decisions we may make on changes to the funding regime in any operating or ownership model for the network.

In advance of the conclusions of the feasibility study on ownership models, this immediate programme of work will deliver real progress towards a better performing strategic road network, with a clear strategic purpose, transparent expectations on performance, locally grounded investments plans, and a real consumer-focused culture.

My response and the feasibility terms of reference can be found on the Department for Transport website and electronic copies have been lodged with the House library.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/greening-20120626a,60,"**The Secretary of State for Transport (Justine Greening):** Today I am publishing a summary of responses to the Government's consultation on better regulation for aviation security, and announcing the Government's decision on taking forward the initiative.

The consultation document [Better Regulation for Aviation Security](http://assets.dft.gov.uk/consultations/dft-2011-21/dft-2011-21-consultation.pdf) set out proposals to modernise the regulatory regime for aviation security to bring it into line with better regulation principles, promote innovation and efficiency and ensure the best possible passenger experience. It proposed a move to an Outcome Focused Risk Based (OFRB) approach which would give operators the flexibility and responsibility to design security processes that deliver specified security outcomes, perhaps more focussed towards the needs of their passengers, rather than requiring them, as at present, to comply with prescriptive security requirements. It builds on the successful and similar approach that now applies in aviation safety regulation.

The move to an OFRB approach would be managed through the introduction of a Security Management System (SeMS) developed and operated by each responsible organisation. A SeMS is an organised, systematic approach to managing security which embeds security management into the day-to-day activities of the organisation.

We will begin with a series of SeMS pilots, starting at London City Airport once the Olympics have finished, in which industry operators will develop the SeMS approach and in so doing enhance their internal security cultures. The pilot at London City Airport will be concerned only with the organisation and governance of security at the airport, not with the security checks themselves, which will continue to be managed and delivered in the current way.

Once these pilots have been concluded, and we are satisfied that the SeMS process is sufficiently robust and will deliver its intended benefits, we shall look to roll it out generally across the industry. This will provide a sound basis for the development and piloting of the OFRB approach.

The consultation ran from 14 July until 7 November 2011. Some 116 responses were received, from a range of organisations and individuals in the aviation industry as well as from interested bodies. I am grateful to them for the time they took in responding and for their informed and constructive comments.

I am pleased to say that there was overwhelming support for the proposed new approach. In publishing the consultation the Government acknowledged that these are complex proposals which require further development. The responses have been helpful in clarifying some of the issues involved, including importantly the proposed timetable.

The consultation proposed that the new arrangements should be phased in over three years starting in April 2013. The Civil Aviation Bill, which is currently before Parliament, provides for various aviation security functions that are currently performed by the Department for Transport to be conferred on the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Subject to the date of Royal Assent, we are preparing for the CAA to take on those functions from April 2014. The OFRB proposals would represent a significant change in the approach to the regulation of aviation security. We have therefore decided that development and roll-out of SeMS is the right first step to take towards the roll-out of the OFRB approach. The CAA has been consulted and supports this decision. The conferring of functions on the CAA does not depend on this development being completed.

The summary report, with further information about our plans for implementing the new approach, will be available in the Libraries of both Houses and on the Department's website.

The responses, along with work done by my officials in conjunction with other stakeholders, highlighted the strategic importance of NATS to the UK and the far reaching implications of a sale at this time. These include the continued development of the Single European Sky agenda and the ongoing work on the Single European Sky Air Traffic Management Research Programme (SESAR).

In parallel I have considered the potential value that could be realised through a sale of the shares alongside the benefits from receiving dividends from a retained shareholding.

After considering these factors, I have concluded that it is in the best interests of the British taxpayer, the travelling public and the company itself to retain the Government's shares in NATS at this time.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/greening-20120712a,62,"**The Secretary of State for Transport (Justine Greening)**: In March 2011, the Government launched a scoping exercise towards developing a new sustainable policy framework for UK aviation. I am grateful to the more than 600 organisations and individuals who responded. We have given careful consideration to their responses in preparing the [draft Aviation Policy Framework consultation document](/consultations/dft-2012-35), which I am publishing today.

The responses to the scoping exercise reflected a wide degree of consensus on aviation's significant economic contribution and its other benefits, that its global and local environmental impacts are real and need to be tackled effectively and that maintaining the UK's excellent international connectivity is critical. The consultation document sets out the Government's high level policy in each of these areas and seeks views on some of the measures we propose in support of our approach.

We clearly recognise the value of aviation as an important economic sector in its own right and as a key driver of UK economic growth. It contributes around £17 billion of economic output and employs over 220,000 workers directly and many more indirectly. And we recognise the strength of the UK's aviation connections which give us the third largest aviation network after the US and China and make London one of the best connected cities in the world with direct links to over 360 destinations worldwide, more than either Paris or Frankfurt.

The Government has a package of measures underway to improve the passenger experience at our airports and make the best use of existing capacity, as well as taking forward a process to address the UK's international connectivity needs in the medium and longer term.

First, we are improving efficiency at our borders. My Rt Hon Friend, the Home Secretary is reviewing the UK's visa regime, to improve the passenger experience and to ensure that our border policy supports our prosperity agenda whilst maintaining effective security. Any changes to the UK's visa regime will be implemented during the course of 2013. The Home Office has also brought forward the recruitment of 70 additional staff at Heathrow to provide additional flexibility to secure the border while dealing with increased passenger numbers. And it is looking at how we can improve the role of automation in the expedited clearance of passengers, linked to the development of a registered traveller scheme to replace the current IRIS scheme which has been extended.

We are improving reliability and reducing delay at Heathrow through the trial of measures introducing greater operational flexibility. If operational freedoms show clear benefits in terms of resilience, reducing delays and allowing planes to land more effectively, thereby reducing the impact of noise for residents under the flight path, then we will consult on making these benefits permanent.

We are taking forward other recommendations of the South East Airports Taskforce, such as airport performance charters which will set out the level of service that airlines and their passengers should expect, as well as new guidelines developed in a Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) chaired industry group which will make the best use of existing capacity.

We are transforming the economic regulation of airports through our Civil Aviation Bill to promote passengers' interests. We propose to replace the current uniform approach to regulation - where designated airports are subject to mandatory five-year price caps - with a modern licensing regime where licence conditions can be tailored to the specific circumstances facing individual airports. By allowing for more proportionate regulation, the new regime also enables the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to take steps to reduce the degree or scope of economic regulation imposed on individual airports if they decide this would benefit passengers. The Bill will also ensure that airports can respond more flexibly to real-time events such as severe weather or volcanic ash and put in place a long-term framework for improving quality of service and investing in better infrastructure and facilities. The Bill is on track to receive Royal Assent by spring 2013 and we expect the new licensing regime to be implemented from April 2014.

We are improving surface access to airports with significant new investment. In total over this spending review period the Government is supporting investment of £1.4 billion on rail and road schemes which will directly or indirectly benefit airports across the UK.

This includes a fleet of thirty new electric trains on the Stansted Express to London which entered service last year and a £53m upgrade of Gatwick Airport station with improved passenger facilities, an extra platform and more track and signalling by 2013 and a Regional Growth Fund contribution of £19.5 million for junction enhancements to be completed by 2014 which will improve access from the M1 to Luton Airport.

And the Metrolink extension to Manchester Airport is due to open in 2016 which will provide a tram every 12 minutes between Manchester Airport and Manchester city centre.

In the future, Luton and Gatwick will receive improved rail services through the Thameslink programme and we expect Heathrow passengers to benefit from Crossrail.

But we recognise that we need to go further now in enhancing the capability of UK airports, particularly in the South East. So today we are also announcing:

  * The commitment of up to £500m towards a western rail link to Heathrow, subject to a business case and conclusion of agreements with the aviation industry. This recognises the continued importance of Heathrow as our major international hub. Businesses west of the airport have been calling for this vital investment for many years. It will cut typically 30 minutes off the journey to Heathrow from the west of England and south Wales, with significant benefits for growing cities like Swindon, Bristol and Cardiff. The service could come into operation as early as 2021. I will shortly publish a rail investment strategy, which will recognise the importance of transport investment to the economy, including improving connectivity between cities and airports.
  * Proposals to further liberalise the UK aviation market to encourage foreign airlines to develop new routes by extending to Gatwick and Stansted the ability for foreign airlines to pick up passengers when flying to other destinations.
  * Our proposal to remove bilateral restrictions on air services on a case-by-case basis. This will mean open access to airports outside the South East for new air services, in order to facilitate inward investment in new routes and extra choice for business and passengers without necessarily having to secure reciprocal access for UK airlines to the airports of the other country.
  * Our commitment, building on the Olympics and the GREAT brand, to develop a new marketing package, working with BIS, UKTI, and others to market the benefits of flying to a range of UK airports and to target new carriers, particularly carriers in emerging markets such as Latin America, India and South East Asia.
  * That we will work with airports to explore, with the US authorities and others, the feasibility of US pre-clearance facilities being made available in the UK, which could improve the competitive offer airports operating such a scheme would be able to make.
  * That we will invite train companies to explore the potential of 'code-sharing' between flights and long-distance train services, to enhance competition between trains and domestic flights.
  * Our intention to identify options, within the EU legislative framework, aimed at ensuring that slots at our congested airports are used in the most economically beneficial way for the UK. The focus of this work is on seeking to optimise the functioning of the secondary trading market for airport slots. We expect to engage with key stakeholders later in the summer and publish a progress report in the autumn. We are also working with the EU, in the context of the Commission's proposals on reform of the rules on landing slots to secure measures to support UK regional connectivity, such as protecting the provision of air services between Northern Ireland and Heathrow.
  * Our support for the introduction of new rules by airport operators aimed at maximising the use of existing capacity at our busiest airports - for example, by limiting access to smaller planes.

In doing so, we recognise the very substantial efforts the aviation industry is making in continuing to invest and respond to the market.

For example, Heathrow and Gatwick are investing £5 billion and £1 billion respectively over the next few years in better infrastructure and Birmingham Airport will shortly begin constructing a £65 million runway extension which will increase the airport's scope to open new routes to long haul destinations.

Airlines are launching new routes to key emerging markets, such as British Airways who recently announced a new service to Seoul. China Southern Airlines is now flying from Heathrow to Guangzhou and Gatwick is showing its potential, for example with Air China's new service to Beijing.

These are positive developments and will help to maintain the UK's excellent international aviation connectivity in the short term. The Government recognises, however, that it must not only take steps for the short term but also address the issue of future airport capacity and we are committed to doing so.

Following our scoping exercise last year, our draft Aviation Policy Framework is the next step towards that and we welcome responses to this consultation. We will follow this, later this year, by issuing an open Call for Evidence inviting stakeholders to submit specific, evidence-based proposals for consideration in identifying the medium and long term steps needed to meet the Government's economic and environmental objectives for aviation. This is a structured process towards delivering a solution that is sustainable, not only economically and environmentally but also politically. The failure of successive governments to tackle this issue shows that we need to get it right this time. Success depends upon agreeing a solution that can be delivered regardless of the political cycle and that requires an objective evidence-based process which draws on the views of the full range of interested parties.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/greening-20120712b,63,"**The Secretary of State for Transport (Justine Greening):** In January I announced the Government would proceed with plans to build a high speed rail network linking London with Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester. This is a vital project that will create jobs, drive economic growth and provide a solution to the capacity crunch facing our existing rail network. Work on the project continues apace and I will be publishing my preferred routes for the second phase of the project in the autumn.

Alongside January's decision I confirmed my intention to deliver a generous compensation package for those affected by the route which goes over and above the minimum required by law.

I am acutely aware of the impact that the proposals for HS2 are having on the property markets along the line of route from London to the West Midlands. The impacts on property are some of the most direct and personal effects of HS2. This is why we have committed to going above and beyond the statutory requirements for property compensation.

Developing the right property compensation package is complex as it needs to be fair to those living and working along the HS2 London to West Midlands route while recognising our broader responsibility to the taxpayer. It was clear from the responses to the consultation that we held last year that property compensation was an issue that generated a considerable amount of understandable concern from those affected. In addition, from personally dealing with the casework from the operation of the existing Exceptional Hardship Scheme, I recognise the range and complexity of issues that the property and compensation package for HS2 will need to deal with. This all means that it is imperative that we put in place the right package.

I am keen to consult as soon as possible to provide people with certainty but, given the nature of the issue and its implications for Phase 2 and work to assess stations and route options, it is clear to me that the detailed work to fully assess options means that we will consult on the property and compensation package for HS2 after Parliament returns from its summer recess in September. I understand that this delay will not be welcomed by individuals and businesses who had hoped to see an earlier resolution to the uncertainty surrounding HS2 property and compensation policies. However, this will enable the Government to put forward a comprehensive, practical and affordable package of property and compensation measures. I will be writing to those likely to be most directly affected by the project to explain this change.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/greening-20120716a,64,"**The Secretary of State for Transport (Justine Greening)**: Today I am announcing my High Level Output Specification (HLOS) for the railway, as required by the Railways Act 2005. Covering the period from 2014 to 2019, it describes my vision for a railway which is more financially and environmentally sustainable, which supports economic growth and which delivers for its passengers and freight customers.

I am confirming £16 billion of public support for rail in this period, which will support £9.4 billion of infrastructure enhancement. £5.2bn of this has previously been committed, including Thameslink, Crossrail and electrification of the Great Western Main Line and in the North West and Yorkshire. The additional £4.2bn includes:

  * A new Electric Spine - a passenger and freight corridor linking the core centres of population and economic activity in the East and West Midlands and Yorkshire with the South of England, which includes electrifying the Midland Main Line.
  * Further targeted electrification alongside this, including the Great Western Main Line from Cardiff to Swansea and the Welsh Valleys; between Micklefield and Selby in Yorkshire and between Walsall and Rugeley in the West Midlands.
  * Increased rail capacity for commuters, with over £700 million to be invested on the most congested routes in London and the South east and over £400 million for other cities, including completing the Northern Hub that will link key Northern cities bringing clear benefits to Newcastle, Liverpool, Manchester Leeds and Sheffield. Taken with Crossrail, this will provide for 120,000 additional commuting trips per day into London in the morning peak and 20,000 into our other major cities.
  * Further investment on Great Western Main Line, including at Bristol and Oxford Stations as well as additional track capacity on the approaches to Bristol.
  * Over £900 million investment in funding for smaller schemes to improve: 
    * stations, including accessibility so that everyone can use the railways;
    * the current strategic rail freight network;
    * passenger journey times and reliability.

Today's announcement represents another historic landmark in the regeneration and modernisation of Britain's railway. This Government's vision for the railways is clear - a railway system that is faster, more reliable, less crowded, and more green.

Just as we are dealing with the budget deficit, so we are also determined to deal with the massive infrastructure deficit we inherited. Rail is just one part of an unprecedented programme of transport investment this Government has put in place to drive growth and job creation in the UK economy. We are building HS2, investing £1bn in strategic road schemes and supporting 56 local road schemes, as well as supporting light rail and bus projects.

Previous governments have underinvested in rail. We will not repeat those mistakes. This is a government with a long term vision for a modern and efficient rail system that supports growth and improves competitiveness.

The Penfold Review examined various development consents, additional to planning permission, which developers must apply for. It identified measures the Government could take to minimise the burden of complying with and administering these consents, while maintaining the essential benefits that they protect.

We propose to permit applications for a stopping-up or diversion order to be submitted at the same time as applying for planning permission, whereas under existing legislation the developer can only apply after securing planning permission, and are consulting on options for devolving decision-making to the local authority level.

These measures were committed to in the 2011 Autumn Statement and will help to deliver the Government's growth agenda, by removing unnecessary burdens faced by businesses, speeding up the application process and removing unnecessary bureaucracy. They will play a useful role in encouraging investment and therefore growth in local communities.

Most of the policy options in the consultation will require primary legislation to amend the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, as it applies to England. Subject to the outcome of the consultation, we intend to deliver this through the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill.

The consultation document, including impact assessment, will be available in the Libraries of both Houses and on the Department's website.

This review identified that 413 responses, amounting to less than one per cent of the 55,322 responses received in total, had not been included in the part of the consultation response assessment carried out by the Government's independent response analysis consultants, Dialogue by Design. The results of this analysis were summarised in their report published alongside my announcement of 10 January (High Speed Rail: Investing in Britain's Future - Consultation Summary Report). This report formed just one of the elements supporting my decisions, alongside other evidence including analysis of issues raised in consultation responses carried out by my Department and HS2 Ltd, as well as engagement with the public, MPs and other stakeholders through roadshow events, seminars, visits and meetings.

Of the 413 responses identified, six had been incorrectly marked as duplicates by Dialogue by Design. The remaining 407 were amongst those sent in by email to my Department rather than via the direct channels set out in the consultation document and were unintentionally not forwarded to Dialogue by Design for analysis.

My Department commissioned a supplementary analysis from Dialogue by Design which concluded that these responses ""do not provide any information that was not already included in the previous Consultation Summary Report or would have made a difference to the substantive content or balance of that report"". Inclusion in the original analysis would not have changed the substance of Dialogue by Design's findings, nor affected the considerations which informed me in taking my decisions following the consultation.

All affected respondents will be contacted with these details.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/grenning-20120131,67,"**The Secretary of State for Transport (Justine Greening):** Today I am launching a consultation paper to take forward discussions for deciding a new devolved system for prioritising and funding local major transport schemes for the next Spending Review period - schemes which have cost over £5m.

The previous Government's Regional Funding Allocation process failed to give local people and communities proper transparency for decisions, and control over spending - investment decisions were taken centrally and it was a bureaucratic and inefficient system which hampered local enterprise and delivery. The Government has already made efficiencies on the programme of schemes inherited from this process. In total, schemes commencing construction in this Spending Review period are forecast to deliver benefits of around £8 for every £1 of public money spent, with a 34% reduction in the central Government contribution compared to previous plans.

We now have the opportunity of developing a new system for beyond 2015. A system which ensures that the best outcomes are achieved for the economy whilst balancing the need for developing sustainably and reducing carbon emissions; a system which hands real power to local communities; and, a system which is fit for purpose in practical delivery terms.

As local major transport schemes can take on average four years to move from business case to the start of construction, it is vital that we begin to develop a new system now.  And to fully empower local areas means giving them freedoms and flexibilities they have not had before.

Proposals set out in the consultation paper include: using a population based formula to allocate funding rather than putting in place a costly bidding process; a locally led assessment process for prioritising schemes, reducing the role of central Government which many local areas perceive as costly, time-consuming and autocratic; and, putting Local Enterprise Partnership areas in the driving seat over which transport schemes are delivered.

The Government is proposing to devolve decisions to democratically accountable local transport bodies involving Local Enterprise Partnerships and local authorities, which are given responsibility for establishing a prioritised programme of schemes for investment. These local transport bodies would oversee the delivery of individual schemes, but would not be the vehicle for delivery, which would remain with individual local authorities or other relevant delivery agencies.

Local Enterprise Partnerships would be central to decisions, to ensure that transport investment is fully aligned with plans for economic development. Local Enterprise Partnerships can play a strong role in helping to make the tough trade-offs between competing priorities and will have a say in investment financing. Transport authorities, however, would also be crucial given their expertise, responsibilities and leadership role on transport matters.

The new system would encourage decision-making across Local Enterprise Partnership boundaries to local transport consortia - groupings of Local Enterprise Partnership areas - in order to manage a handful of big schemes, which were experienced under previous systems.   However, the Government will not force consortia formations, which would risk creating ineffective and artificial partnerships that lack legitimacy.

Instead it will be for local areas to decide what collaborations are right for them and to prioritise eligible transport interventions, which they collectively agree to deliver local growth.

In return for greater devolution, central Government will need assurances on effective governance, financial management, accountability and the achievement of value for money - matters which businesses and local authorities do every day.

In particular, the Government proposes that while local areas will have the freedom to decide their own priorities and appraise individual schemes, all schemes would need to follow the Transport Business Case framework and be appraised in line with webTAG, the Department's best practice and well-evidenced guidance on transport appraisal and evaluation.

Individual schemes would also be expected to be dealt with transparently, in particular through the publication of business cases at each stage of scheme development, individual schemes meeting minimum value for money thresholds, ongoing review and monitoring, and pre and post delivery evaluation of scheme benefits.

The offer of devolution will be available to all, but different local areas will have different challenges and ambitions. The Government will take an individual approach with each local transport body to put in place a tailored system that is fit for purpose and secures value for money for the tax-payer.

I welcome responses to the consultation paper. The consultation runs from 31st January 2012 until 2nd April 2012. This is shorter than the usual 12 weeks but will help ensure there is a system in place which enables local areas to begin to construct schemes by 2015.

Following the end of the consultation, my Department will consider all responses and produce a summary report alongside setting out the next steps. I will make a further statement to the House at that point.

As we have consistently said, tackling the deficit is our top priority.

And by taking the tough decisions on current spending, we are able to secure our future growth by making vital infrastructure investments. 

Over the next four years we will provide £14 billion of funding to Network Rail to support capital maintenance and infrastructure investment; and £750 million for high speed rail. We will also fund the Crossrail project, the Tube upgrade programme, light rail projects in Birmingham, Tyneside, Nottingham and Sheffield; and provide additional funding to franchisees for extra rolling stock.

I can also confirm today that we will fund and deliver the Thameslink programme in its entirety, virtually doubling the number of north-south trains running through central London at peak times. This huge investment will link Sussex, Kent and Surrey, through central London, with Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire and Cambridgeshire.

But the original programme for the rebuilding of London Bridge Station to increase through-running as part of this project was always ambitious, with substantial risks around delivery, and operation of existing services, during construction.  To reduce these risks, we have re-profiled the delivery of the programme to achieve completion in 2018.  This will enable Network Rail to make the further efficiencies in the design and delivery of the programme, that we require to ensure value for money.  Passengers will start to benefit from incremental improvements on Thameslink routes from the end of 2011.

As part of the Thameslink programme, we will procure a new fleet of trains - up to 1,200 new carriages. This is in addition to around 600 new carriages which will be provided for the Crossrail project.

Together with the Tube upgrades, these projects represent a step change in rail capacity in London, providing a significant boost to economic growth potential in the capital. 

New Thameslink and Crossrail rolling stock will enable the redeployment of hundreds of serviceable electric carriages currently used on the Thameslink services.  These carriages belong to rolling-stock leasing companies, but we expect that they will be available at competitive leasing prices for re-use elsewhere, thus justifying further electrification of the network.

As a first step, I can announce today that Network Rail will electrify the commuter services on the Great Western Main Line from London to Didcot, Oxford and Newbury over the next six years. Electric trains will speed up journeys, improve reliability and reduce the impact on the environment on these busy routes.

   
The Chancellor also announced on 20 October the electrification of the lines between Liverpool, Manchester, Preston and Blackpool - an investment of up to £300 million. I expect work in the North West to begin next year and to be completed at around the same time as the work on the Thames Valley Commuter Lines in 2016. Some sections will be completed well ahead of this, notably Manchester to Newton-le-Willows in late 2013, allowing new electric trains to operate from Manchester to Scotland. As with Thameslink, we will require Network Rail to keep a tight rein on costs.

The redeployment of electric rolling stock to these routes will, in turn, free up hundreds of diesel units which will be available to Train Operators to lease as they become available in the period after 2015. 

This will all be welcome news to passengers. The Public Accounts Committee recently found that many services are unacceptably overcrowded, and I understand the frustrations of rail travellers who have to travel on packed trains.  More investment is clearly needed. That is why I argued for additional rail investment in the Spending Review, and it is also why I have taken the difficult decision to allow regulated fares to rise by 3 per cent above inflation for the three years from 2012 - to help us to pay for these investments.

Mr Speaker, in January 2008 the previous Government published a plan to bring 1,300 additional carriages into service by March 2014. This plan was never deliverable. In total, only 206 of those 1,300 carriages had entered service by May this year.

My predecessors quoted a grand total of rail carriages, but never referred publicly to the fact that delivery of that total was subject to so many caveats and qualifications as to render it effectively meaningless.  According to their published plan Mr Speaker, the 1,300 was not final and subject to - ""value for money, affordability, … linkages with other interventions or with other rail projects, … infrastructure constraints, … supply chain constraints"" and ""credibility"". It went on to say in the document that ""the final outcome could well be different"".

In other words, not so much a plan as a press release. 

So let me set the record straight: I can today confirm that an additional 650 carriages will have been delivered to the network between 6 May 2010 and March 2014.

   
This is in addition to the Thameslink and Crossrail carriages I have already mentioned.  

But it isn't just about rolling stock.  Network Rail have already started work on station improvements, with funding confirmed for developments at Reading, Birmingham, London Kings Cross and Gatwick Airport.

Investments on the East Coast Main Line and Midland Main Line and improvements in Yorkshire, on trans pennine routes, around Manchester and in South Wales will improve line speed, reliability and capacity of services.

Beyond these investments, there are far-reaching decisions to be made about intercity services.

In February 2009 the Intercity Express Programme, launched by the previous Government, identified the Agility Trains consortium as preferred bidder to build a new fleet of intercity trains.

Then, this February, my predecessor invited Sir Andrew Foster, the former head of the Audit Commission, to provide an independent assessment of the programme. Sir Andrew presented his report to me at the end of June, recommending further work on the Agility Trains proposal and a detailed study of the alternatives.

I can now tell the House that we have narrowed down the options from the four Sir Andrew identified, to two.

I have ruled out the option of requiring passengers to change from electric to diesel trains at a point in their journeys, recognising the value to passengers of preserving through-journeys. I have also ruled out the option of a wholesale refurbishment of the existing diesel ""Intercity 125"" fleet, some of which dates back to the 1970s.

The remaining options are, on the one hand a revised, lower cost proposal received from Agility Trains, which envisages a mixed fleet: some all-electric trains, and some electric trains which are also equipped with underfloor diesel electric generators. And on the other, a fleet of new all-electric trains which could be coupled to new diesel locomotives where the overhead electric power lines end.

Both these options would allow us to preserve through-journeys between London and parts of the rail network which are not electrified.

Both of them would deliver faster journey times.  For example, we expect to see time savings of at least 15 minutes for the journey between Cardiff and London, bringing it below 2 hours.

This is a major decision which will affect intercity rail travel for decades to come, and we must get it right. To address the outstanding issues on choice of train type and further electrification on the Great Western Main Line, additional work will be required within the Department, with Agility Trains, and with the Welsh Assembly Government on the business case for electrification into Wales.

When this work, and discussions with the Welsh Assembly Government and my Rt Hon Friend the Secretary of State for Wales, have concluded, I expect to announce a final decision on IEP, and on further Great Western electrification, in the New Year.

Mr Speaker, the package I have confirmed today has only been possible because this government has been prepared to take the tough decisions to protect investment in Britain's future.

This is a commitment to our railways which will benefit Britain for generations to come and I commend this statement to the House.

However, the preferred bidder has informed the Ministry of Defence within the last 48 hours that it has become aware of a possible issue in connection with its bid to provide the UK Search and Rescue capability, which was the basis of its selection as the preferred bidder as announced in February 2010.

In the circumstances it is not appropriate for us to proceed with the planned announcement until the status of this issue has been clarified. 

My Rt Hon Friend and I will make a further statement to the House as soon as we are able to provide further information and to set out our plans for proceeding to secure the provision of Search and Rescue helicopter capability in the future.   We regret the further uncertainty that this entails for all those involved in providing the UK's Search and Rescue service.

 
",Department for Transport,Search and Rescue Helicopters Procurement,16 December 2010,"Written Statement by Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, Secretary of State for Transport.",The Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP,2010-12-16,Written statement,"Aviation, Shipping"
http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/hammond-20101220,70,"With permission, Mr Speaker, I wish to make a statement on the Government's plans for the development of a national high speed rail network, and on the proposed route that we will put forward next year for public consultation.

One of the Coalition's main objectives is to build an economy which is more balanced both sectorally and geographically, that will deliver sustainable economic growth while delivering on our climate change targets. Investment in infrastructure, and transport infrastructure in particular, will be a key part of that approach.

To deliver economic growth and carbon reduction we must provide attractive alternatives to short-haul aviation, while addressing the issue of scarce rail capacity between the city centres. Network Rail has calculated that by 2024 the West Coast Main Line will effectively be full, with no further enhancements that could reasonably be made to meet future demand.

The Government believes that the best long-term solution to these challenges is the development of a national high-speed rail network. Our proposed strategy is for a Y-shaped network, to be delivered in two phases: the first a line from London to the West Midlands, and the second the onward legs to Manchester and Leeds with connections to points further north via the East and West coast mainlines. 

Our proposals would provide an unprecedented increase in capacity on the key north-south routes out of London, through a combination of new infrastructure and released capacity on existing lines.

Reliability would be improved and journey times between major cities would be slashed. Central Birmingham would be brought within 49 minutes of London - potentially less for non-stopping trains - and within 1 hour 5 minutes of Leeds. The released capacity on the West Coast Mainline would offer the possibility of commuter frequency fast services to London from places like Coventry and Milton Keynes.

By running trains seamlessly onto existing inter-city routes, our proposed network would also bring Glasgow and Edinburgh to within three-and-a-half hours of London - fast enough to induce a major shift of passengers from domestic aviation. In the longer-term, we will also explore with the Scottish Government the options for further reducing journey times to Scotland.

The development of a high speed rail network has been a key factor in our decision on additional runways at London's airports, and that is why we have said from the outset that any such network must be linked to our principal gateway airport and integrated with the European high speed network via HS1. In June, I asked HS2 Ltd to carry out additional work on such links. I have studied that work and the recommendations of Lord Mawhinney's review.  I have also examined Arup's proposals for a transport hub near Iver.

I have concluded that a spur to the airport, running on the surface close to the M25 for part of its length, is the best option. It is lower-cost than the other options considered by HS2 Ltd, keeps journey times between London and Birmingham to a minimum, and retains the flexibility to be extended into a loop in future. In order to deliver the best possible value for taxpayers' money, I propose that a spur be constructed as part of the second phase of the network, opening at the same time as the routes to Manchester and Leeds.  I have today asked HS2 Ltd, to carry out further work on such a spur route, with a view to public consultation later in this Parliament alongside the routes to Manchester and Leeds.

For the period prior to the opening of that second phase, high speed rail travellers to the airport would be able to change to fast Heathrow Express services at Old Oak Common, where there would also be a direct interchange with Crossrail.

With regard to a link to HS1, HS2 Ltd's report identifies that a connection can be made via a new tunnel from Old Oak Common to the North London Line near Chalk Farm, from where existing infrastructure can be used to reach the HS1 line north of St Pancras. This proposal is significantly cheaper than any other option for a direct link, and would enable direct trains to run from the midlands and the north to Europe, without affecting existing service levels on the North London Line.

Such a tunnel can only be constructed before the Old Oak Common interchange comes into operation, so this link will be included in the phase one scheme put forward for consultation.

Mr Speaker, the Government believes that the construction of a high speed rail network will support economic growth and the rebalancing of the UK economy. But we recognise that the proposed line will have significant local impacts on the areas it passes through. And that we have a duty to do everything practically possible to mitigate those impacts.

That is why, since my appointment as Secretary of State, I have reviewed the proposals of the previous administration. I have looked at the case for High Speed Rail, at the corridor options for a north-south route, at the different route options put forward by HS2 Ltd and in detail at the route option recommended in its March report. I have reached the conclusion, as the previous administration did, that the route option recommended in March represents the most appropriate general alignment for the High Speed Railway between London and the West Midlands. However before finalising the detailed route that I am publishing today for consultation, I travelled the length of it and talked directly to local authorities, property owners, many of the protest groups and their Members of Parliament, as well as commissioning additional work on the options for improving the proposed alignment.

As a consequence, significant amendments have been made to both the vertical and horizontal alignment, and to the proposed mitigation measures. In total, around 50% of the preferred route proposal published in March has been amended in some respect.

I am confident that solutions have now been found which can significantly mitigate the impacts of the railway at local level which, when properly understood, will reassure many of those who have been understandably apprehensive about the potential impact on their lives and their property values.

For instance, in Primrose Hill, work to identify the most appropriate locations for the necessary vent shafts has shifted the proposed tunnel, and thus also the vent shafts themselves, to the north, away from the most sensitive areas of this part of London, locating them alongside the existing railway.

Between Amersham and Wendover, opportunities to cover section of the proposed cutting to create a 'green bridge' and longer 'green tunnel' have been incorporated into the route design to reduce its visual impact and avoid severance of public rights of way.

At Hartwell House, by moving the alignment away from this historic property, HS2 Ltd have been able to ensure that the line would not be visible from the House itself and that additional earthworks and planting can be undertaken to further reduce visual and noise impacts.

And in the most northerly section of the route, an improved alignment has been identified which would move the line further from Lichfield.

But, Mr Speaker, despite our best efforts at mitigation, we will not be able to avoid all impacts on property values. Where a project which is in the national interest imposes significant financial loss on individuals, I believe it is right and proper that they should be compensated fairly for that loss. So I have asked my officials to prepare a range of options for a scheme to assist those whose properties would not be required for the construction of the railway, but who would nonetheless see a significant diminution of value as a result of the construction of the line. The forthcoming consultation will include proposals for such a scheme, which will sit alongside the statutory blight regime which covers those whose properties would need to be taken to build the line.

I am publishing today on my Department's website and placing in the library of the House, a set of reports by HS2 Ltd which set out for each route section the options considered and the changes proposed, together with detailed maps showing the revised preferred route from London to the West Midlands in full.  This route will form the basis for the public consultation, which I expect to begin in February next year.

When the consultation is launched, I will also publish a revised business case; a full Appraisal of sustainability; noise contour maps; and route visualisations; all of which can only be completed now that the final preferred route for consultation has been determined.

Let me be clear, the consultation will encompass the Government's strategy for a national high speed rail network, the choice of corridor and the detailed line of route that I have outlined for the initial London to West Midlands phase.

As part of the consultation process, roadshows will be held along the length of the preferred route from London to the West Midlands to ensure that local people have the opportunity to find out more about the project and to discuss specific concerns with those involved in developing the scheme.

Mr Speaker, it is my view that a high speed rail network would deliver a transformational change to the way Britain works and competes in the 21st century,

It would allow the economies of the Midlands and the North to benefit much more directly from the economic engine of London, tackling the North-South divide more effectively than half a century of regional policy has done, expanding labour markets and bringing our major conurbations closer together.

The consultation exercise we will launch in the New Year will be one of the biggest and most wide-ranging ever undertaken by Government and I urge all Hon. Members with an interest to participate and to encourage their constituents to do so.

These proposals have the support of political and business leaders from all parts of the United Kingdom, and I hope they will gain cross-party support in this House.

Mr Speaker, I commend this statement to the House.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/hammond-20110204,71,"**The Secretary of State for Transport (Mr Philip Hammond):**

On 26 October, following the announcement of the conclusions of the Spending Review, I made a statement to the House outlining our plans for investing over £1.5 billion over the next four years on major capital transport schemes promoted by Local Authorities. I also set out a process for deciding which schemes would receive funding and published details in a document entitled ""Investment in Local Major Transport Schemes"". I am today announcing the first set of decisions in line with the process as set out.

First, we announced in October a pool of ten Local Authority schemes with very high value for money or large local contributions that we wished to support. However we challenged the local authority promoters to reduce the cost to the exchequer and to submit revised funding bids.

I am pleased to say that through this process we have saved £45.5m on these schemes - 14% of the previously approved sums and I am pleased to confirm funding for the following schemes.

  * Leeds Station Southern Access: Improving pedestrian access to Leeds station (£12.4m DfT contribution towards a total cost of £14.4m)
  * Midland Metro Extension: Extending Midland Metro tram line through Birmingham City Centre (£75.4m DfT contribution towards a total cost of £129.2m)
  * Mansfield Public Transport Interchange: A new bus station and associated transport improvements in Mansfield (£7.2m DfT contribution towards a total cost of £8.9m)
  * Thornton to Switch Island Link: A new single carriageway road which will take traffic away from communities in Sefton (£14.5m DfT contribution towards a total cost of £18.6m)
  * Ipswich Fit for the 21st Century: An integrated package of sustainable transport improvements in Ipswich (£18.3m DfT contribution towards a total cost of £21.5m)
  * East of Exeter: Improvements to M5 J29, east of Exeter, providing access to new housing and employment areas (£10.4m DfT contribution towards a total cost of £14.4m)
  * Heysham to M6 Link Road: A bypass to the north of Lancaster, connecting Heysham to the M6 (£110.9m DfT contribution towards a total cost of £123.3m)
  * A57 M1 to Todwick Crossroads: Improvements on the A57 east of M1 J31, near Todwick (£11.8m DfT contribution towards a total cost of £14.7m)
  * Taunton Northern Inner Distributor Road: A new road in Taunton to provide additional cross town capacity and access to areas of brownfield land (£15.2m DfT contribution towards a total cost of £21.7m)

These schemes will now be able to progress towards construction subject to securing any remaining necessary planning and statutory approvals and subject to confirmation of value for money where material changes have been proposed.

For the remaining scheme in the Supported Pool, the Mersey Gateway Bridge, we are carefully considering a funding proposal from the promoters, Halton Borough Council. As this is the largest scheme with the most complex funding proposal of any scheme in the Supported Pool, we are not able to announce final funding arrangements at this point, but will do so as soon as possible.

I also announced in October a Development Pool of 22 schemes on which funding decisions would be made by the end of 2011, and a Pre-Qualification Pool of 34 schemes on which we would make an earlier decision on which should join the Development Pool.

I can today announce the promotion to the Development Pool of 23 schemes from the Pre-Qualification Pool, making an expanded Development Pool of 45 schemes, based on their potential to offer value for money, their ability and willingness to offer savings to the DfT and, in the case of five structural maintenance schemes, the potential importance of the work to the integrity of the existing road network. The local authority promoters of these 23 schemes have indicated a potential to reduce the call on DfT funds that would amount to an overall saving of 42% on the total of the previously requested sums. I am encouraged by this and I look forward to working with the promoters of these and the existing Development Pool schemes to try to achieve further savings when the promoters of all schemes in the Pool submit their Best and Final Funding Bids by September 2011.

As we set out in October, we do not expect that all schemes in the Development Pool will be funded. We will scrutinise the business case for each scheme very carefully and challenge promoters to demonstrate high value for money as well as significant savings on cost. We will also look at a range of other criteria, including deliverability and strategic fit, and will seek the views of interested parties including, where appropriate, Local Enterprise Partnerships. The process remains competitive and those schemes that do not reach an acceptable standard will not be funded.

In respect of the schemes from the Pre-Qualification Pool not selected for the Development Pool, promoters will need to consider their options. Beyond this Spending Review period my intention remains that we should move to a more devolved funding framework for major schemes with Local Enterprise Partnerships and others. I will develop this framework further during 2011.

It may be that for some of these schemes there remains a reasonable prospect of funding through this route or with alternative funding sources.  But there also needs to be realism. I would urge promoters of the non-selected schemes to consider, in consultation with the business community and local residents, whether further investment in the development of these schemes would be in the best interests of local council tax payers.

This Government is committed to transparency in decision making. I have placed on the DfT website a written document, as an update to ""Investment in Local Major Transport Schemes"", which sets out the details of these scheme approval decisions and explains the rationale on which they have been based. The document also includes the Benefit to Cost Ratios and Net Present Values, as estimated in the Spending Review, of Supported Pool and original Development Pool schemes. I will also place on the DfT website the Best and Final Funding Bids and Expressions of Interest that have been submitted by the Local Authority promoters.

In mid December, the Preferred Bidder in the SAR-H competition, Soteria, voluntarily came forward to inform the government of irregularities regarding the conduct of their bid team which had only then recently come to light. The irregularities included access by one of the consortium members, CHC Helicopter, to commercially sensitive information regarding the joint MOD/DfT project team's evaluations of industry bids and evidence that a former member of that project team had assisted the consortium in its bid preparation, contrary to explicit assurances given to the project team.  

Since December, our two Departments have been working with Soteria to better understand the situation and its implications for the procurement process.

In 2007, an initial Agreement was reached between Crossrail Ltd, the Department for Transport, Transport for London and Berkeley Homes. This Agreement stated that Berkeley Homes would build the basic box structure of a station at Woolwich and subsequently construct their own extensive mixed use development above it. This would be done at Berkeley Homes' cost and risk, to the specification laid down by Crossrail Ltd, in a way that ensured that the Woolwich Station Box did not add to the current cost of Crossrail. This Agreement was outlined to Parliament by the then Secretary of State for Transport in March 2007.

The Department for Transport, Crossrail Limited, Transport for London, and Berkeley Homes, have in recent months been working urgently to turn this initial Agreement into a final, legally binding, agreement.

I am therefore pleased to inform the House today that a final Agreement has now been reached by all parties. This means that engineering work on Woolwich Station Box can now proceed and the benefit of Crossrail investment can be secured for the residents of Woolwich.

In due course, fit-out of the Woolwich Station Box would be required to bring it to operational status. Government is clear that, in line with the 2007 agreement, no additional public sector contribution can be made available to fund the fit-out of the Station Box. Instead, the fit-out is conditional on receiving sufficient funding contributions from developers and businesses operating in the area. Berkeley Homes has an obligation to enter into discussions with Department for Transport, Transport for London, Crossrail Ltd and Greenwich Council, in order to provide for the subsequent fitting-out of the Station Box. All parties, including Berkeley Homes, have made clear that they understand and support this position.

I shall update the House as and when progress is made in relation to the private-sector funding of the station fit-out.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/hammond-20110228,75,"**The Secretary of State for Transport (Philip Hammond):** Today, I am launching the [consultation](http://highspeedrail.dft.gov.uk) on the Government's proposals for a national high speed rail network.

High Speed Rail: Investing in Britain's Future sets out the Government's case for this network, the details of the Government's strategy, and the proposed route for an initial phase from London to the West Midlands. It will be one of the most extensive national consultations ever undertaken.

I believe that a national high speed rail network from London to Birmingham, with onward legs to Leeds and Manchester, could transform Britain's competitiveness as profoundly as the coming of the railways in the 19th century. It would reshape Britain's economic geography, helping bridge the north-south divide though massive improvements in journey times and better connections between cities - slashing almost an hour off the trip from London to Manchester.

But the proposed High Speed Rail network would do more: It would address Britain's future transport capacity challenge - providing a huge uplift in long distance capacity and relieving pressure on overstretched conventional lines. It would bring around £44 billion of net monetised benefits and support the creation of thousands of new jobs, as well as delivering unquantifiable strategic benefits. And it would help us to build a sustainable economy - by encouraging millions of people out of cars and off planes onto trains. Our competitors already recognise the huge benefits of high speed rail and are pressing ahead with ambitious plans. Britain cannot afford to be left behind.

The Government's support for high speed rail was set out clearly in its Programme for Government, published in May last year. Since then, we have built upon the work already done by [HS2 Ltd](http://www.hs2.org.uk/) to consider the case for high speed rail in the UK. Last October's Spending Review settlement reaffirmed our support and provided over £750 million to fund the development of our national network proposals over the next four years.

Since then, Government has received additional advice from HS2 Ltd on options for a national high speed rail network and on direct links to Heathrow and the High Speed 1 (HS1) line to the Channel Tunnel.

The Government understands the concerns of those living near the proposed route. Following a series of visits I made along the proposed London-West Midlands line, we have altered around half the original route - significantly reducing the potential local environmental impacts.

In the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, all but 1.2 miles would be in tunnel, cutting, or close to the A413 road corridor. Since HS2 Ltd's original report to Government was published in March 2010, the number of properties where high noise levels would be expected to be experienced has fallen from 350 to around 10.

In December 2010, I set out our proposed high speed rail strategy, our preferred route and our approach to delivering a wider high speed network. 

However, we recognise that decisions should not be taken on a major infrastructure project of this scale until all those with an interest have had their say. So this [consultation](http://highspeedrail.dft.gov.uk) - **which will run until 29 July** - seeks views on: the case for high speed rail; our strategy for a national high speed network; the proposed route for an initial line from London to the West Midlands; and our options for providing assistance to those who are detrimentally affected by any new line. Responses can be submitted through the HS2 Consultation website, or sent to a freepost address.

Copies of the consultation document have been placed in the Library of the House and are available on the DfT website. I am also publishing a number of more detailed supporting documents, including a detailed economic case, a full Appraisal of Sustainability and a route engineering report.

My Department will be conducting a series of regional seminars to inform the strategic debate, together with a series of roadshows along the line of the proposed London-West Midlands route. These will give people the chance to discuss our plans and the specific local impacts and mitigation proposals with the engineers and other specialists working on the project.

This is a once in a generation infrastructure investment that would have a transformational effect on Britain's economy.

",Department for Transport,High Speed Rail,28 February 2011,"Written Statement by Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, Secretary of State for Transport.",The Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP,2011-02-28,Written statement,"Rail, High speed rail, Rail value for money"
http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/hammond-20110301,76,"With permission, Mr Speaker, I wish to make a statement on the Government's plans for extension of the electrification of the Great Western Main Line and for the procurement of a replacement for the existing diesel intercity trains. These two issues are closely connected.

I turn first to the provision of a new generation of intercity 125 mile per hour trains to take advantage of the electrification of the Great Western Main Line and to allow the phasing out of most of the ageing diesel ""Intercity 125s"".

In February 2009 the Intercity Express Programme, launched by the previous Government, identified Agility Trains, a consortium of Hitachi Rail (Europe) Ltd and John Laing Plc, as the preferred bidder to provide a new fleet of intercity trains. Subsequently, the previous Government placed this process on hold and ordered a review of the procurement by Sir Andrew Foster.

Last summer, recognising the fiscal challenges the UK faces and also recognising the impact of the new Government's plans for high speed rail to Leeds and Manchester, Agility put forward an improved, lower cost, proposal, which provides the required service through a mixed IEP fleet: some all electric trains; and some with a combination of electric and diesel power, allowing them to operate through services beyond the electrified railway. This proposal retained the more modern electric Intercity 225s on the East Coast Main Line, as the previous administration had proposed.

We have reviewed this proposal against the alternative of an all-electric fleet, with purpose built diesel locomotives being coupled to trains to haul them beyond the electrified railway. 

Either way, this would represent a multi-billion pound investment for this country underpinning the operation of intercity services on the conventional railway for many years to come, and it is imperative that the right choice is made.  

As I said at the time of my statement to the House on 25 November, there were complex legal, technical and commercial issues to be addressed. Both the Government and Agility Trains as preferred bidder recognised this.

Over the last few months we have worked together on these issues and I can now announce that I am resuming the IEP procurement and proceeding with the proposal that Agility Trains have put forward as preferred bidder.

We will now work with Agility Trains with a view to reaching financial close by the end of this year. This is, of course, subject to the Government continuing to be satisfied that the proposal offers value for money as the commercial negotiations are concluded and that the final arrangements are compliant with the United Kingdom's EU obligations. 

This deal will allow us to provide better, faster, more comfortable services and to continue providing through-journeys between London and parts of the rail network which are not electrified.

In total, there will be over 11,000 more peak time seats each day on the Great Western Main Line and East Coast Main Line post IEP, compared to today. 

Hitachi is today confirming its plans to locate its European train manufacturing and assembly centre at Newton Aycliffe in County Durham. This investment is expected to create at least five hundred direct permanent jobs as well as hundreds of temporary construction jobs. Thousands more job opportunities will be created in the UK manufacturing and service supply chains. 

Coming just days after the news of the re-opening of the Redcar Steel Works, this is a massive - and very welcome - shot in the arm for the skilled work forces of the North East's industrial heartland.

I turn now to the related issue of electrification of the Great Western Main Line. I announced to the House on 25 November that, over the next six years, Network Rail will electrify the commuter services on the Great Western Main Line from London to Didcot, Oxford and Newbury. I recognise that this announcement, although welcomed in the Thames Valley, left unanswered the clear aspirations of rail users further west for the extension of electrification to Bristol and into Wales. I and my Rt Hon Friend the Secretary of State for Wales have subsequently considered the options for extending electrification, alongside the Government's consideration of the proposals for replacement of the current diesel Intercity trains, and in close consultation with the Welsh Assembly Government.

We have concluded that there is a case for extending electrification westwards to Bristol and Cardiff and I am today asking Network Rail to add this major extension to their electrification programme immediately.

This is good news for Wales and the South West - against a backdrop of public spending constraint as we deal with the legacy of debt we have inherited. Bringing electrification to Cardiff will mean that we are linking, for the first time, the capital cities of England, Scotland and Wales by electrified rail.

These measures will deliver a London to Cardiff journey time of an hour and 42 minutes and will shave 22 minutes off the London to Bristol journey.

I have received representations calling for electrification of the Great Western Main Line to be extended as far west as Swansea and we have looked carefully at the arguments. The business case for electrification is heavily dependant on the frequency of service. Services between London and Swansea currently operate at a frequency of only one train an hour off-peak. There is no evidence of a pattern of demand that would be likely to lead imminently to an increase in this frequency. Consequently, I regret to say that there is not, at present a viable business case for electrification of the mainline between Cardiff and Swansea.

But, because of the decision to proceed with Agility's proposal for a bi-mode train, journey times from London to Swansea will be shortened to two hours and 39 minutes - 20 minutes faster than today - with trains switching automatically to diesel power as they leave Cardiff. Because the constraining factor on the South Wales Main Line is speed limitations dictated by the geometry of the line, there would be no time saving benefits from electrifying the line from Cardiff to Swansea.

However, the policy of the Government is to support a progressive electrification of the rail network in England and Wales, for environmental, among other reasons. My Rt Hon Friend, the Secretary of State for Wales, and I will therefore keep under active review the business case for future electrification of the Great Western Main Line between Cardiff and Swansea in the light of developing future service patterns.

I have a further announcement to make to the House. In the course of the examination of the case for electrification in South Wales that I and my Rt Hon Friend have undertaken, we have established, at an initial high level, that a good case appears to exist for electrifying the key valley commuter lines north of Cardiff via Pontypridd and Caerphilly to Treherbert, Aberdare, Merthyr Tydfil, Coryton and Rhymney, as well as the lines to Penarth and Barry Island to the west. My Department will therefore work with the Welsh Assembly Government to develop a full business case for the electrification of the Cardiff Valley lines within the next rail investment control period beginning in 2014.  The Welsh Assembly Government will need, in parallel, to consider the case for specifying suitable electric trains for these routes when the Wales and Borders franchise is re-let in 2018. This would, of course, be a prerequisite for electrification to proceed, and the timetable for franchise re-letting, and re-specification, necessarily dictates the timescale of this proposed electrification.

On the basis of our preliminary evaluation, the Valleys electrification represents the best value for money rail electrification investment that can be made in Wales. It promises to bring all the benefits of electric commuter trains - faster acceleration, greater comfort and cleaner, greener travel, as well as greater reliability - to rail users in South Wales.  It would have a significant effect on the economy of Cardiff and the Valleys - deepening labour markets, improving connectivity and significantly enhancing the attractiveness of the area to investors.

Coupled with the electrification of the Great Western Main Line, this represents a major boost to the economy of South Wales as a whole.

These three decisions, on Intercity Express, Great Western Main Line electrification and to build a business case for electrification of the Valley commuter lines, represent a major further investment in UK rail infrastructure - following the announcements I have already made on Crossrail, Thameslink, Tube upgrades, Thames Valley and North Western electrification and additional rolling stock.

They sit alongside the Government's proposals for High Speed Rail, the [consultation](http://highspeedrail.dft.gov.uk) on which I announced to the House in a written statement yesterday, as testimony to this Government's commitment to investment in the future of Britain's railways.

They represent excellent news for passengers on the Great Western Main Line and the East Coast Main Line, for commuters on the Cardiff Valley lines, and for the economies of South Wales and North East England as a whole. 

I commend this statement to the House.

Today I am announcing that legislation to implement these reforms will be introduced early in the next session.

[Reforming the framework for airport economic regulation](http://www.dft.gov.uk/topics/airports/economic-regulation-of-airports/#) will help improve the quality of service that passengers receive at designated airports and contribute positively to economic growth.

As I set out in my statement to the House on 21 July 2010, we plan to replace the existing statutory framework for regulation at designated airports with a more flexible licence based system. This will give the CAA the powers it needs to become a more responsive regulator, for example to deal with events such as the severe weather this winter. The reforms will also strip out unnecessary regulation and support passenger-focussed investment in existing airport infrastructure.

I am keen to ensure that there is a smooth transition to the new regime and we will work with the CAA and industry to achieve this. In particular, the Government will not be making changes to the basis on which the current price caps at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted are set.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/hammond-20110321,78,"**The Secretary of State for Transport (Philip Hammond):** I have today placed in the Library of the House the Government's response to a report by Sir Peter North on drink and drug driving which was published in June 2010.  This response also covers a report by the Transport Select Committee which was published in December 2010.  The Government's response is available on the Department's website - [www.dft.gov.uk](http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/the-governments-response-to-the-reports-by-sir-peter-north-and-the-transport-select-committee/#).

The Government is committed to improving road safety.  It is a priority to deter driving when unfit through drugs or alcohol, and to ensure that those who persist in this dangerous behaviour are detected and punished effectively.  We must protect law-abiding road users with measures that are effective and proportionate, concentrating on those who are a danger to themselves and other road users, while avoiding unnecessary social and economic impacts.

We are convinced that our first priority must be to give the police the means to identify drug drivers and compel them to give evidential samples for testing.  It is just as dangerous for people to drive impaired by alcohol or drugs, and it is quite wrong that it is easier at present to get away with one than the other. There needs to be a clear message that drug drivers are as likely to be caught and punished as drink drivers and that drug driving is as socially unacceptable as drink driving.

We have taken the first steps to address this with a specification for drug testing equipment for the police.  We aim to have this available for use later this year.  We will - as Sir Peter suggested - examine the case for a new specific offence which would remove the need for the police to prove impairment on a case-by-case basis where a specified drug has been detected.  The introduction of fixed thresholds for blood-alcohol as the test for drink driving has delivered benefits to road safety that are clear for all to see.  
  
Our strategy is to focus resources and any legislative changes on measures which will have the most impact in reducing dangerous behaviours.  There are therefore two main priorities -

  * to continue the successful abatement of drink driving and achieve similar success against drug driving by giving the police effective tools to identify and proceed against drink and drug drivers;
  * to streamline the enforcement process for drink and drug driving to remove pressure on police and other enforcement resources.

A staggering proportion of drink drivers are well over the current limit - 40% of those caught by the police are 2.5 times the limit.  The proportion of drivers over the limit who are killed is the same.  Their behaviour is entrenched and displays a flagrant disregard for the law and the safety of other road users. We have concluded that improving enforcement is likely to have most impact on these dangerous people, and will therefore be the most effective use of scarce resources, rather than lowering the prescribed alcohol limit for driving. 

We will implement the following measures, bringing forward legislation where necessary at the earliest opportunity :

  * revoke the right to opt for a blood test when the evidential breath test result is less than 40% over the limit (the 'statutory option') as this causes delay which results in some offenders avoiding prosecution;
  * streamline the procedure for testing drink drivers in hospital;
  * close a loophole used by high risk offenders to delay their medical examinations;
  * require drink drivers who are substantially in excess of the limit to take remedial training and a linked driving assessment - as well as a medical examination - before recovering their licence;
  * re-launch the drink drive rehabilitation scheme under which drink drivers can get the period of their driving disqualification reduced if they complete an approved training course;
  * approve portable evidential breath testing equipment for the police -and provide for preliminary testing not to be required where evidential testing can be undertaken away from the police station;
  * approve preliminary drug-testing equipment, initially for use in police stations - and at the roadside as soon as possible;
  * delegate to custody nurses the assessment police doctors are now required to make of suspected drug-drivers;

Full impact assessments, including among other things the potential impacts on enforcement and the judicial system, will be prepared in the usual way when legislation is brought forward.

It also committed the Government to create a sustainable framework for aviation in the UK. This framework will replace the previous administration's The Future of Air Transport white paper which, while recognising aviation's economic benefits, failed to take sufficient account of climate change and the impact of aviation on local communities. Today I am publishing a Scoping Document which aims to define the debate as we develop a new long-term policy for UK aviation.

The Government is committed to returning the UK to sustainable economic growth. Aviation has an important role to play in delivering that growth. It makes a significant contribution to the UK economy and provides the international connectivity this country needs to thrive in the highly competitive global economy. This Government wants to see aviation prosper. Aviation should be able to grow, but it must also play its part in delivering our environmental goals and protecting the quality of life of local communities.

The Government has made clear its commitment to meeting the challenge of climate change. Today, aviation contributes around six per cent of UK CO2 emissions but this share will increase as demand for air transport increases and other sectors of the economy reduce their emissions. The Scoping Document explores the most effective ways of addressing aviation's environmental impacts, both global and local, and seeks answers to questions on both issues.

The publication of this Scoping Document represents the start of a dialogue to give a wide range of stakeholders an opportunity to contribute to the development of the policy framework. I expect the views expressed to be varied, and sometimes difficult to reconcile, but I want to move the aviation debate on from the polarisation which has characterised it in recent years, towards a consensus which balances the benefits that aviation brings with its impacts, both global and local.

We will publish a draft policy framework for public consultation in March 2012, and formally adopt the framework by March 2013.

This outlines the Government's plans to reduce deaths and injuries on Britain's roads as well as the measures and steps that others can take. It is available for download from the Department for Transport website.

The strategic framework aims to provide clarity to local authorities, road safety professionals and other stakeholders on their roles and responsibilities in improving road safety and the increased freedom that is being given to local authorities in assessing and acting on their own priorities.

In line with the Coalition's commitment to localism, we want decisions to be made locally, wherever possible, and this document sets out how we are moving away from over-arching national road safety targets and towards a more sophisticated method of monitoring progress through a Road Safety Outcomes Framework which will help local authorities assess and prioritise their action and show the impact of central Government measures.

Additionally, at the local level, there will be an increase in the road safety information that is available to the public to help them hold their local authorities and service providers to account.

Of course, there is still an important role for national Government in delivering safer roads. Our central focus will be on supporting road users who have weak driving skills or who display a lapse of judgement to improve their driving, while focusing enforcement resources against those who deliberately decide to undertake antisocial and dangerous driving behaviour.

Where road users make low level mistakes or display poor skills we intend to divert them in to a greater range of educational courses to help develop safer skills and attitudes. We will extend this approach to careless driving through the introduction of a new fixed penalty notice as well as new remedial educational courses. We need to re-balance road safety enforcement away from a narrow focus on camera-enforced speed policing, to address the wider range of behaviours that create risk on the roads. Where road users commit serious, deliberate and repeated offences we aim to increase the effectiveness of enforcement for this minority - for example, through improving the efficiency of action on drink and drug driving. Through this approach we aim to improve the targeting and effectiveness of enforcement to tackle a wide range of unsafe behaviours that cover all careless and dangerous driving offences.

Our long-term vision is to ensure that Britain remains a world leader on road safety and to continue the downward trend in casualties.  We believe that the measures set out in this strategic framework will help us to achieve this vision.

Full impact assessments, including the potential impacts on enforcement and the judicial system, will be prepared in the usual way when legislation is brought forward.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/hammond-20110516,82,"**Secretary of State for Transport (Philip Hammond)**: I am today launching a consultation on the criteria that the Government considers particularly relevant to the consideration of the appropriateness of sale of a major trust port [1] in England or Wales under the Ports Act 1991.

During the consultation period, which will run for six weeks until 27 June 2011, I am seeking the views of interested parties on the following criteria, which I propose to adopt in place of those set out in the Written Ministerial Statement on the sale of trust ports of 25 January 2010.

In view of this consultation, I have asked my Rt Hon Friend the Minister of State to suspend her consideration of the application for a transfer of the port undertaking made by Dover Harbour Board under the Ports Act 1991 until I announce a decision on the proposed criteria.

## The Proposed Criteria

The following criteria are those which the Government considers particularly relevant when considering an application under the Ports Act 1991 for the sale of a major trust port in England or Wales. This covers the consideration of any proposal for a transfer scheme submitted under section 9 or 10 of the 1991 Act, together with the exercise of the Secretary of State's functions in respect of the subsequent sale of the port to which the scheme relates.  The Secretary of State also intends to have particular regard to the policy considerations set out below before making a transfer scheme himself under section 12 of the 1991 Act or subsequently approving the sale of a port to which his scheme relates.

### Community participation

The Secretary of State will not approve an application for the sale of a trust port under the 1991 Act unless the sale is considered likely to deliver an ongoing and significant level of community participation in the port.  Such participation could take a variety of forms, but must include the ability to influence the port's long term development and may include the right to receive a share in the profits of the port, or the future increase in its value.  It does not necessarily require a community role in the operation of the port.

### Future Development of the Port

The Secretary of State will not approve an application unless the sale is considered likely to deliver an ownership model with the capability and access to capital to meet future investment needs.

### Fair price

The Secretary of State will not approve an application unless the sale is considered likely to represent good value for money, having regard not only to Exchequer proceeds and market conditions, but also to other benefits including those to the community and the wider economy.

### Fair competition

The Secretary of State will not approve an application that is likely to deliver an ownership model which results in unsatisfactory levels of competition in the relevant sector.

### Transport networks

It is highly desirable for an application to be likely to deliver an ownership model which will cause the port to be operated so as to contribute to reliable and efficient transport networks.

### Sale process

It is highly desirable that the sale should be conducted in such a way as to give all bona fide prospective purchasers a fair and equitable opportunity to participate.

### Employee involvement

It is desirable for an application to be likely to deliver port employee participation in the ownership of the port, such as the right to receive equity shares or a share in its future success. [2]

[1] For the purposes of the Act, a 'major trust port' is a trust port with an annual turnover above a certain limit (currently £7.6m). In England and Wales this currently includes Dover, Tyne, Milford Haven, Shoreham, Poole, Harwich Haven and the Port of London Authority (though the latter is excluded from provisions on privatisation contained in the Act).

[2] This is without prejudice to the Ports Act 1991 section 5(3) requirement to have particular regard to the desirability of encouraging the disposal of the whole or a substantial part of the equity share capital of the successor company to managers or other persons employed by the port company etc.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/hammond-20110519,83,"With permission Mr Speaker, I would like to make a statement about the publication today of Sir Roy McNulty's independent study into Value for Money in the Rail Industry and also update the House about the West Coast franchise process.

Sir Roy's report notes that UK rail has enjoyed a revival in recent years, with strong and resilient growth in overall numbers of passengers and in passenger satisfaction, and huge improvements in reliability and safety.

This Government wants to see Britain's railways continue to prosper and has demonstrated by its actions its commitment to them: Despite the difficult fiscal climate, we have allocated funding to complete Crossrail and Thameslink and to support the upgrade of the London Underground; We have announced electrification on the Great Western Mainline and in the North West of England. We've resumed the Intercity Express Programme to improve reliability comfort and journey times on the East Coast and Great Western Mainlines; We've given the go-ahead to the Ordsall Chord project in Manchester and the Swindon to Kemble re-doubling; confirmed the purchase of over 2,000 new rail vehicles for Thameslink, Crossrail and for other franchises and the cascading of 100's more; and last Mr Speaker, but not least, we've begun the HS2 High Speed Rail consultation process.

But Mr Speaker, Sir Roy has also made another, less welcome finding. Spending on the passenger railway has increased by 60% in real terms since 1996/97, that's more than £4bn, and despite significant passenger growth, unit costs in 2009 were almost exactly the same in real terms as in 1996, so that UK rail is now up to 40% more expensive per passenger mile than the railways of our European competitors.  After allowing for unavoidable differences, Sir Roy estimates that UK rail costs are 20-30% higher than they should be, and that potential savings amounting to between £740m and £1.05bn a year could be found by 2018/19 without any reductions in services. These savings, when added to the savings Network Rail are already committed to achieving to 2014 and the savings Sir Roy expects the Regulator to seek from Network Rail over the period to 2019, should largely close this efficiency gap.

Many of Sir Roy's recommendations are directed to the industry, and the open and inclusive process that the study has adopted means that some of them are already being implemented: the industry has come together to form a Rail Delivery Group to provide the leadership which Sir Roy has noted as lacking in the past; and Network Rail has announced its plans to devolve significant autonomy to route managers across the network - starting with the Wessex and Scottish regions.

Sir Roy's remit, set by my predecessor and the ORR who co-sponsored the study, was narrowly focused on the cost-base of the railway. He makes a large number of recommendations and over the coming months, the Government will consider those of Sir Roy's recommendations that are directed to it and will deliver its response later this year. Many of the recommendations on franchises reflect the changes the Government has already announced and in addition I can confirm today that my Department will accept Sir Roy's recommendation that it should conduct a full review of fares policy, including addressing anomalies in the current system and the potential for much greater use of smart technology.

In parallel, the Government is developing a wider rail strategy to ensure the affordable, sustainable, safe and high quality railway, that will deliver a better deal both for taxpayers and to farepayers and set out clearly the roles of Government, - both central and local - train operators and Network Rail in securing the future of the railway.

Mr Speaker, this is urgent and vital work. Let us be in no doubt - the excessive cost base that Sir Roy has identified is the reason that UK Rail fares are already by some margin the highest in Europe, even though levels of taxpayer subsidy are also among the highest in Europe. And let's be clear about the potential prize: the successful delivery of cost reductions over the next few years on the scale set out by McNulty, would enable us to reduce levels of taxpayer subsidy and, at the same time, put the era of inflation-busting fare increases behind us. 

But achieving the challenging targets for cost reduction and industry-wide efficiency gain that Sir Roy has identified will need all players in the industry to work together.  The train operators, Network Rail, Rolling Stock Companies, Unions and Government - none of them can avoid playing their part if we are to deliver a sustainable and affordable railway for the future. 

In the case of my Department, Sir Roy is clear that we need to step back from excessively detailed specification of train services and micro-management of rail operations.  I recognise this will represent a major culture change - but one I am determined to deliver. 

Mr Speaker, I would like to place on record my thanks to Sir Roy McNulty and his team for the excellent work they have done and to welcome Sir Roy's commitment to working with the industry on an ongoing basis. 

I also wish to announce to the House today the publication of the draft Invitation to Tender and stakeholder briefing document for the Inter City West Coast franchise, which lays out the train service specification I am minded to procure for this route.

As I have said, the Government has already adopted Sir Roy's recommendation that franchise specifications should become less prescriptive. The proposed Train Service Specification for Inter City West Coast represents a relaxation from the rigid timetable specifications of the past, while retaining obligations that protect the key elements of service, such as principal first and last train services and minimum numbers of station stops per week and per day.  This marks a significant shift from the micro-management that has, under the current system, prevented operators from maximising capacity and reacting to the changing demands of their passengers.

Amongst other proposed changes, we intend to replace the current ""cap and collar"" revenue sharing system that has driven perverse behaviour by train operators, with a GDP-based risk-sharing arrangement and a profit-share mechanism which will ensure the taxpayer benefits from any unexpected profits over the term of the franchise.

Because relaxation of full prescription of train services in line with Sir Roy's recommendations was not signalled in the consultation document that we published on 19 January, I have decided that it is right and proper to consult on these proposals again, starting today, and ending on 17 August.  As a consequence of this decision, Mr Speaker, I can inform the House that the new franchise on the Intercity West Coast will now be awarded in August 2012, after a competitive process involving the four shortlisted train operators, and will commence operations on 9th December 2012.  In making this decision, I have deliberately avoided a change of franchise immediately ahead of or during the Olympic period and have also decided to take advantage of the short delay to complete the integration of the 106 new Pendolino carriages into the fleet prior to the commencement of the new franchise.

The Department will seek to agree acceptable terms with the existing franchisee for a contract extension to 9th December 2012, but Directly Operated Railways Ltd, the Government-owned company that runs East Coast, will be ready to operate the franchise between April and December 2012 if necessary.  

Copies of the Rail Value for Money study and the draft Invitation to Tender for the West Coast Mainline have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses and are available on the Department's website.  

Our expectation is that future passenger franchises on UK rail will allow operators greater flexibility to meet passenger demand and to pursue innovation, while protecting the key elements of service for passengers.

Longer franchises and a changed relationship with Network Rail will have a positive impact on the behaviour and appetite for investment and risk taking by train operators.  But I want to send a clear message that the new culture of cooperation in the rail industry, and the focus on cost reduction, is here to stay and it is mandatory, not optional.  So I can today announce that, as a matter of policy for all future franchise competitions, a significant part of the assessment of bidders' capability at the pre-qualification stage will be evidence of success in collaborative working and driving down costs.

Mr Speaker, the facts are clear: our railway costs too much; in consequence fares are rising faster than inflation and taxpayer subsidy has reached unsustainable levels.

To secure the future of the railway, we now have to tackle this problem after a decade of ignoring it, and get costs into line with those of our European comparators, bringing relief to taxpayers and the prospect of an end to the era of above-inflation fare increases to passengers.

I commend this statement to the House.

The timing of this is not as a result of any specific threat: it is a sensible and pragmatic approach to ensuring that our police forces have the right resources to be able to respond as and when needed to protect the public.

By sanctioning the development of this armed capability, we will reduce the burden on other police forces which currently provide armed support to the BTP. This is not a major new capability in terms of overall armed policing, but by training BTP officers to carry out armed patrolling of the rail network it equips BTP with a capability already available to other police forces. Armed patrols will be deployed according to operational need - it will not be a daily event to see armed officers at stations.

We will continue to work with the BTP and others to assess the use of this capability and its effectiveness and impact. I would like to reassure Parliament that this is a measured and proportionate approach to supporting the BTP in maintaining public safety on the railway.

It was announced in the Budget (March 2011) that the Government ""intends to realise value from its shareholding in NATS, subject to considering the views of key interested parties"". This commitment reflects the Government's policy that assets held in the public sector where there is no policy requirement to do so tie up state resources that could deliver better value for money for the public if used elsewhere. We are seeking evidence through this process from key interested parties including the regulator, employees of NATS and the wider aviation industry, to establish whether or not there is a policy requirement to retain a shareholding in NATS.

NATS provides strategically important services to the UK and as such, I want to ensure that the overall aviation policy objectives of safety, security, economic regulation, civil/military cooperation, environment and supporting the Single European Sky programme are not compromised by any decisions we take over future share ownership. The call for evidence document outlines the controls and protections that exist in NATS' operating environment independent of the Government's shareholding and seeks evidence from consultees on what, if any, protections would be required on top of these to allow the delivery of these objectives.

The call for evidence will be open from today until 6th July and we aim to publish the results shortly after the closing date. The evidence collected will support my final decision about whether to sell Government shares in NATS.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/hammond-2011070,86,"**The Secretary of State for Transport (Philip Hammond):** As part of the Government's strategy to ensure successful delivery of efficient transport services for the 2012 London Olympic Games, I am today announcing the introduction of new measures to limit disruption and delay to all flights using airports in the south east of England during the expected period of peak demand for air services for the Games.

The Airports Slot Allocation (Amendment) Regulations 2011, laid before Parliament today, will come into force on the 1st August 2011. They will temporarily amend the existing regulations so as to provide new powers to ensure that during the Games period the available air space capacity over the south east of England will be able to accommodate the maximum possible number of extra flights, whilst minimising the risk of disruption or delay to existing services. These regulations will cease to have effect on the 31st December 2012.

In conjunction with the new regulations, and following two rounds of consultation, on the 1st August 2011 the Secretary of State for Transport will designate the airports listed below as temporarily coordinated until the 15th August 2012, but only in respect of slot allocation during the period of 21st July 2012 to 15th August 2012 inclusive. This period corresponds to the anticipated peak demand for air services for the Games.

In the south east of England, Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted and London City are already coordinated airports. Airports that will additionally be coordinated for the Olympics period are: Birmingham Airport, Blackbushe Airport, Bournemouth Airport, Cambridge Airport, Chalgrove Airport, Coventry Airport, Cranfield Airport, Damyns Hall Aerodrome, Denham Aerodrome, Dunsfold Aerodrome, Duxford Airport, Elstree Airport, Fairoaks Airport, Farnborough Airport, Goodwood Aerodrome, Lee-on-Solent Airport, Leicester Airport, London Biggin Hill Airport, London Luton Airport, London Oxford Airport, London Southend Airport, Lydd (London Ashford Airport), Manston Airport, North Weald Airfield, Old Sarum Airfield, Peterborough Conington Airfield, RAF Northolt, Redhill Aerodrome, Rochester Airport, Shoreham Airport, Southampton Airport, Stapleford Airport, Sywell Aerodrome, Thruxton Airport, White Waltham Airfield, Wycombe Air Park.

During this period all flights operating in controlled airspace and intending to use a coordinated airport will need to obtain, and operate in accordance with, pre-booked take-off or landing slots. Slots will be allocated by Airport Coordination Ltd, the existing UK slot coordinator, in accordance with the relevant EU Regulation.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/hammond-20110711,87,"**The Secretary of State for Transport (Philip Hammond):** On 8 February I informed the House that, owing to irregularities in the bidding process, the Government had concluded that it was not appropriate to proceed with the previously planned joint MOD/DfT PFI procurement for future search and rescue capability.

The investigation into the circumstances that led to the cancellation of that procurement is ongoing. Work is also underway to identify the optimum procurement options for the long term provision of search and rescue helicopter capability for the UK.  However, as the existing Maritime and Coastguard Agency search and rescue helicopter contract that provides service at Portland, Lee on Solent, Shetland and the Isle of Lewis is set to expire, I wish to inform the House of my plans to ensure that search and rescue helicopter services from these locations continue uninterrupted until new long term arrangements are in place.

To ensure the continuity of services from these locations, the Department for Transport will shortly run a competition to procure an interim service for a period of up to five years. This contract will be similar to the arrangements that are currently in place for these bases and are working well. The contract will be open to all interested bidders able to offer a service that fully meets our requirements and ensures the safety of the public and seafarers.

These arrangements will ensure that search and rescue helicopter services are maintained while the range of options in relation to the long term future provision of such services are being fully considered. The Royal Air Force and Royal Navy will continue to provide coverage from their search and rescue bases as at present, while I consider the options for the long term provision of search and rescue helicopter capability.

I will inform the House later in the year of the Government's intentions for the longer term. The procurement strategy we adopt for the longer term will seek to ensure that the Ministry of Defence is able to complete its previously announced intention to withdraw its Sea Kings from service in 2016.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/hammond-20110714,88,"**The Secretary of State for Transport (Philip Hammond):** Today I am launching a [consultation](http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/dft-2011-21) on the Government's proposals to modernise the way we regulate aviation security. Better regulation for aviation security proposes a new outcome focused, risk-based approach to regulation which builds on the successful and similar approach to aviation safety.

Whilst the UK is recognised internationally as having one of the most effective aviation security regimes in the world, we also face a continuing threat from international and domestic terrorism. The Government's recent Strategic Defence and Security Review set out its proposals for securing Britain in an age of uncertainty and included a commitment to improve aviation security.

The proposals in this consultation offer a new approach to the regulation of aviation security. Our current system can place significant financial burdens on the aviation industry along with inconvenience to passengers, and could be more consistent with the Government's better regulation principles. I think we can do better - with a new regime which maintains and improves security standards but in a more efficient and passenger-friendly way.

I therefore propose that the Government should move from prescribing security processes to setting security outcomes. This will give airports and airlines greater flexibility to deliver high standards of security in ways that that are better integrated with their day-to-day business and designed around the needs of the passenger. It will allow them to adopt appropriate new technology as it become available. I want to move away from the current, highly prescriptive, one-size-fits-all approach where all operators run the same regime to one where industry takes a more proactive and more innovative and tailored approach to security.

This approach will also enable the Regulator to operate a system of ""earned autonomy"" - rewarding those operators with the most robust systems of aviation security with greater trust in how they deliver the specified outcomes. Conversely, the level of scrutiny by the Regulator will increase proportionately where any concerns arise about the delivery of the required outcomes.

The safety and security of passengers will remain of paramount importance to the Government, and so the new arrangements will have robust oversight procedures in place to ensure security standards are not compromised. To do this, I am proposing to require all industry operators to develop a Security Management System. This would demonstrate a clear commitment to providing an overall high level of security and set out how security outcomes specified by the UK Regulator and EU requirements will be delivered. Integral to this will be robust internal quality assurance and auditing arrangements which will complement the Regulator's own assurance and compliance processes.

The consultation also proposes new reporting arrangements whereby industry will regularly report to the Regulator on performance and occurrences (including the rectification measures to be taken). This gives the Regulator a fuller picture on which to base decisions and direct regulatory effort. I also propose to introduce a system that allows staff to report on a confidential basis any concerns relating to aviation security. These proposed arrangements will provide an additional layer of assurance. 

This approach offers a new partnership between Government and the industry, one that is dedicated to maintaining the highest standards in aviation security whilst also improving the passenger experience.

These are complex proposals, which require further development in consultation with the aviation industry and other interested parties. The Department for Transport will be making extensive efforts to engage industry during the consultation process to explain the proposals further and to seek input.

Following the end of the consultation, the Government will then consider all responses and produce a summary report along with next steps. I will make a further statement to the House at that point.

 
",Department for Transport,Regulation of Aviation Security,14 July 2011,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, Secretary of State for Transport.",The Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP,2011-07-14,Written statement,"Aviation, Airport, Aviation safety, Security and resilience"
http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/hammond-20110714b,89,"With permission Mr Speaker I wish to make a statement on the Government's intentions on taking forward the process of Coastguard modernisation in the light of responses received to the [consultation](http://www.dft.gov.uk/mca/mcga07-home/shipsandcargoes/consultations/mcga-consultations-archive/hm_coastguard_proposals_for_modernisation_consultation_2010.htm) that ended on 5 May 2011. 

The key drivers behind the modernisation proposals are the need to address the limited resilience of current arrangements, distribute more effectively the workload experienced by different Coastguard stations, and provide enhanced opportunities for Coastguard officers to develop professional skills, with pay levels reflecting enhanced responsibilities. There is also a need to contribute to the wider deficit reduction agenda.

The consultation set out proposals to create a nationally networked Coastguard system with two Maritime Operations Centres - one in the Southampton/ Portsmouth area and one in Aberdeen - together with a 24 hour centre at Dover and five daytime only centres. In addition to delivering greater resilience and better career progression, the proposals identified ways of managing costs while still delivering high levels of service to seafarers and the public. It also set out our commitment to increase by 32 the number of regular coastguards to strengthen the frontline volunteer coastguard.

Mr Speaker, these drivers for change remain. Our strategic objectives in this exercise remain unaltered. But throughout the consultation process I have been clear that we were willing to listen to views of the public, coastguard staff and other interested parties on the best way to deliver the outcomes we need to achieve. Over 1,800 responses were received, including many from serving coastguards. Of the total, 27 submissions suggested specific alternative solutions, all with a reduced number of stations but with differing concepts of operations. We are very grateful to all of those who responded to the consultation and to the Transport Select Committee for also looking at the issues. I can say, Mr Speaker, that this has been a model of consultation, with many serious and thoughtful responses recognising the need to deliver the overall objectives, but proposing alternative ways of doing so.

There were a number of common themes that emerged from the consultation responses. These were:

  * first, widespread acceptance, as illustrated by all the alternative solutions that were put forward, that change is necessary;
  * secondly, concerns about the potential loss of local knowledge and local contacts with volunteer coastguards and other search and rescue partners; and,
  * third, concerns over how the detailed concept of operations for the Maritime Operation Centres and sub-centres would work in practice, particularly how a handover between a day time centre and a 24/7 Maritime Operations Centre would work in practice.

A review of all the consultation responses has been produced under the leadership of a Non-Executive Director of the MCA, involving a number of serving coastguard officers and members of the PCS union. This has been placed in the Library of the House. A formal response from the Government to the report of the Transport Select Committee will be provided separately. 

In the light of the consultation responses, the Government has now concluded as follows:

  * that it remains right to continue with the proposals for a nationally networked system with the introduction of one Maritime Operations Centre capable of managing incidents anywhere and ensuring optimum distribution of workload across the system;
  * establishing one Maritime Operations Centre, rather than the two previously proposed allows us to address concerns over local knowledge and the robustness of the future concept of operations by retaining one of each of the current paired stations, with the retained centres operating as part of the nationally networked system 24 hours a day rather than during daytime only - staff in each of the current 'pair' of stations are already familiar with, and frequently experience, management of incidents in an adjacent area;
  * we have also decided that the Northern Ireland Coastguard centre at Bangor should be retained because of the specific requirement to manage the civil contingency arrangements unique to Northern Ireland and the relationship with search and rescue partners in the Irish Republic with whom we coordinate closely in air sea rescues in the waters around the island of Ireland;
  * in light of the decision to retain one station from each pair, and concerns about Welsh language communication, it has been decided to retain the Holyhead station, rather than the one at Liverpool;
  * in response to concerns expressed over the resilience of infrastructure and communication links within the Scottish Islands and with the Scottish mainland, we have decided to retain Coastguard centres in both Stornoway and Shetland;
  * that in the light of a further review of the potential costs of vacating the existing sites in Swansea and Milford Haven, which has shown that there are no financial reasons to favour either location, and in view of my Department's already very substantial levels of employment in Swansea, we have decided that we should retain the coastguard centre at Milford Haven rather than the centre at Swansea;

In summary, subject to consultation on the changes to the previously announced approach, we will now proceed with the creation of a modernised coastguard service providing a nationally networked system comprising:

  * one Maritime Operations Centre in the Southampton/Portsmouth area with a disaster recovery back-up facility at the Dover station, which will retain its responsibilities for the Channel Navigation Information Service and will also serve as a sub-centre; and,
  * a further eight sub-centres, all operated on a 24 hour basis, located at Falmouth, Milford Haven, Holyhead, Belfast, Stornoway, Shetland, Aberdeen and Humber. 

The stations at Clyde, Forth, Portland, Liverpool, Yarmouth, Brixham, Thames and Swansea will close progressively over the period 2012 to 2014/15. The station at Solent will be replaced by a new Maritime Operations Centre in the Portsmouth/Southampton area and the small station at London is unaffected by these proposals. 

These revised proposals will deliver the modernisation required and are capable of delivering the same level of savings in the longer term as our previous proposals. They are right for the future of the Coastguard service. I recognise, of course, that they will nonetheless represent a huge disappointment to honourable members whose constituencies are affected by the proposed closures.

The additional costs generated by retaining a total of ten centres overall (plus London), all operating on a 24 hour basis, and the higher Coastguard numbers that will be needed to do so, will be offset by operating only one Maritime Operations Centre in the Southampton/Portsmouth area, with a back-up centre, equipped but not staffed, at Dover. By moving to more efficient watch patterns we will still be able to offer higher pay across the service to reflect higher levels of responsibility, while ensuring that costs overall remain within our planned funding for the coastguard as a whole. 

The changes to the original consultation proposal that I have announced today will be the subject of a further period of consultation. This will run for twelve weeks from today, ending on 6 October 2011. Specifically, this includes the decision to retain Holyhead rather than Liverpool; the choice of Milford Haven rather than Swansea; the decision to retain stations at Shetland and Stornoway; and the decision to operate a single Maritime Operations Centre, rather than two.

These changes to our original proposals will deliver the modernised and more cost effective service we need for the 21st century while also responding to the genuine concerns raised during the consultation process and I commend them to the House.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/hammond-20110719,90,"**The Secretary of State for Transport (Philip Hammond):** On 7 March the Government announced plans to introduce temporary airspace restrictions in the South East of England during the London Olympic and Paralympic Games to help protect key Games locations from potential airborne risks. We also made clear that further work would be done to evaluate the potential impact of these measures before final decisions were made. Additional work was also envisaged on possible exemptions and alleviations to mitigate the impact of the proposed restrictions on the aviation industry where possible, without reducing the effectiveness and robustness of the security measures.

Since March further extensive work has been done in conjunction with the aviation sector to understand the likely impact of the planned restrictions on the industry. Alongside this, security experts have also carried out further analysis on the risks to the Games. This work has given us a more sophisticated understanding of the relative challenges as regards the Olympics and the Paralympics. The changes to the original measures have been made to minimise the impact of the restrictions without compromising the safety and security of the Games.

As a result of both this improved understanding and work with the aviation community, the Government is today announcing further development of the plans for temporary airspace control measures.

Between 14 July and 15 August 2012, the airspace measures will, as previously proposed, comprise an inner Prohibited Zone and an outer Restricted Zone, approximately 60 nautical miles across, centred on the Olympic Park.

Only certain categories of aircraft - those operating commercial services and subject to full aviation security procedures - will normally be permitted to operate within the Prohibited Zone. Aircraft involved in, for example, police, emergency medical, essential survey and Olympic Broadcast operations will be exempt. Subject to specific conditions, exemptions will also be granted to flights operating from Denham, Fairoaks and White Waltham airfields, and the London Heliport at Battersea - all located within the Prohibited Zone - directly to and from the boundary with the Restricted Zone.

As previously proposed, all types of aircraft will be permitted to operate in the wider Restricted Zone during this period provided that they can satisfy certain requirements designed to ensure that aircraft within the Zone can be readily identified and monitored by air traffic control. Additional changes to the original plans are now proposed, including exemptions for flights directly exiting the Restricted Zone from airfields within 3 nautical miles of the Zone's outer boundary, and the removal of the prohibition against cross country solo student flights. Small changes to the boundaries of the Prohibited and Restricted Zones are also being made, primarily for reasons of air traffic safety and ease of navigation. Further work is underway to look at whether the current minimum period for filing a flight plan can be reduced from the existing 2 hours.

From 16 August until the Paralympic Village closes on 12 September 2012, the Prohibited and Restricted Zones will be replaced by three separate, smaller, areas of restricted airspace one over Central London and the Olympic Park, one over the Eton Dorney Paralympic rowing venue, and one over the rowing Village at Egham. Access to this airspace will be restricted to those aircraft permitted to operate within the earlier Prohibited Zone. A specific exemption will be granted in respect of operations into and out of the London Heliport.

A similar approach - the introduction of localised areas of temporarily restricted airspace - will be taken in respect of the Games venues elsewhere across the country as and when appropriate during the Games period.

Full details of the planned airspace restrictions, including maps, can be found on the [Airspace Safety Initiative](http://www.airspacesafety.com/Olympics) web site.

It is not expected that any airports will need to close as a result of the planned measures. There should be no impact on scheduled air services, and a significantly reduced impact on most other types of operation within the Prohibited and Restricted Zones as a result of the changes made to the design and duration of the restrictions.

The Government's paramount objective is the delivery of a safe and secure Games for all. We are confident that the measures announced today are a proportionate approach, balancing the need to put in place appropriate and effective counter-measures against potential aviation based risks to the Games with the desire to minimise the impact on the aviation community.

However, should circumstances change, the Government reserves the right to implement additional airspace security measures should the need arise.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/hammond-20110805,91,"**The Secretary of State for Transport, Philip Hammond:**The Government is committed to a major reform of rail franchising that will benefit passengers and taxpayers alike. In preparing our policies we have paid careful attention to the views the rail industry, and others, have expressed to us. Our reforms will create longer, less prescriptive franchises that will give the industry more freedom to innovate, address passenger needs, and more incentive to invest. The reforms will also help achieve the radical efficiency changes needed for a sustainable lower cost railway for the long term. This will include a more equitable balance of risk between the public and private sectors, including replacement of the 'cap and collar' revenue support mechanism with one linked to economic indicators. There will also be stronger emphasis on partnership and closer working between train operators and their local Network Rail Route teams, allowing integrated decision-making which benefits passengers and drives out cost.

These new type of rail franchises will replace existing ones, as and when they expire, and I have today published a comprehensive forward timetable for the re-letting of rail franchises that represents a deliverable and balanced programme. My aim in doing so is to give the market clarity about the timing of the opportunities that will arise. In producing this timetable, I have had regard to the impact on bidders and their sub-contractors of trying to compete for too many franchises at once, and the likely reduction in value for money to the taxpayer that would result.

In summary, the new programme is as follows:

As I have already announced, the new Inter City West Coast franchise will commence in December 2012, with an Invitation to Tender (ITT) issued to the pre-qualified bidders in January 2012.

Following First Group's decision not to exercise its contractual entitlement to take up a 3-year extension on its existing Greater Western contract from 2013, this will now be the next long-distance franchise to come to market, with the new franchise commencing in April 2013, instead of 2016 as originally planned.

As a result, and to avoid having to offer more than one long-distance franchise competition at the same time, with possible consequences for taxpayer value, the new Inter City East Coast franchise will commence in December 2013.

Turning to commuter franchises, there is no change in my plans for Essex Thameside, with the new 15 year contract due to commence in May 2013. The same is true for South Eastern, where the new franchise will start in April 2014.

In light of the likely delivery timescales for Thameslink rolling stock, I judge it right to exercise my contractual entitlement to bring forward the start of a new franchise to September 2013. The franchise is likely to be shorter than 15 years, with a focus on managing services through the major Thameslink infrastructure upgrade. It would then be re-let at the end of the project.

To accommodate the changed dates for Thameslink and Inter City East Coast, I intend to move the start of the long term 15 year Greater Anglia franchise to July 2014, exercising the 12 month extension that is included in to the short franchise that is currently being competed.

I have concluded an agreement with First Keolis TransPennine Express (TPE) which extends the current franchise. The extension incorporates the flexibility to terminate the franchise between April 2014 and March 2015. This flexibility could allow the start dates for the new Northern and TransPennine franchises to be aligned in April 2014, by also exercising the short extension provision in the current Northern franchise. Having both existing franchises end at the same date could allow for these franchises to be combined, or split in different ways. I will be considering the optimal configuration and intend to seek views on the optimum structure from local interested parties. The timescales outlined above will allow for proper consultation and consideration of the possibilities of a radical restructuring in the Northern/TPE area.

In summary, Great Western and Thameslink have come forward (by 35 months and 18 months respectively), the Northern and TPE franchises could now be aligned with a start date of April 2014 - so that we have greater flexibility in re-letting - and two other franchises (Inter City East Coast and Greater Anglia) have been pushed back to accommodate the acceleration of Great Western and Thameslink. Three franchises (Inter City West Coast, South Eastern and Essex Thameside) remain unchanged.  
I have already been clear that not all of these franchises will look the same. I believe in horses for courses and a pragmatic, not dogmatic, approach. I will be guided by what drives value for the taxpayer and service for the passenger on each individual franchise.

Some commentators have suggested this represents a huge programme of work and a major culture shift in Government. I agree with them. It is arguably the biggest programme of franchising since the industry was originally privatised. But it is also a major programme - and a significant culture shift - for bidders. There should be no doubt about our determination to deliver on this agenda, nor the importance of managing it properly.

Revising the programme in this way, while remaining clear about our objectives reflects my view that success depends on having a crystal-clear and unwavering strategy, coupled with a willingness and ability to be agile and tactical in implementing it.

The end result of this work will be a new rail franchising system that delivers better outcomes for passengers and better value for money for taxpayers.

",Department for Transport,New franchising programme,5 August 2011,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, Secretary of State for Transport.",The Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP,2011-08-05,Written statement,"Rail, Public transport, Rail passenger franchises"
http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/hammond-20110915,92,"**The Secretary of State for Transport (Philip Hammond):** On 3 August 2011, I announced the criteria that the Government will consider particularly relevant to the appropriateness of the sale of a major trust port in England or Wales under the Ports Act 1991.  This followed the consultation that I announced on 16 May 2011 [_Official Report_ Column 4WS] and which closed on 27 June.  I regret that it was not possible to announce this first by Written Ministerial Statement to the House, but I did not wish to delay consideration of the application by Dover Harbour Board for a transfer scheme.

I am aware that Dover Harbour Board has now considered the criteria, intends to proceed with its application for a transfer scheme under the Ports Act 1991, and proposes to submit a new set of documents containing a further elaboration of its scheme for decision by the Minister of State under the new criteria.  If  interested parties would find it useful and seek my department's assistance, we would be happy to consider ways in which properly to facilitate discussions on all the options before the Dover Harbour Board submits its elaborated proposal. I should make clear that the decision minister would take no part in such discussions and would continue to perform her statutory functions in an objective, impartial manner whatever the outcome of any such discussions.

The following paragraphs set out the revised policy which the Secretary of State expects to follow when considering an application under the Ports Act 1991 for the sale of a major trust port in England or Wales. This covers the consideration of any proposal for a transfer scheme submitted under section 9 or 10 of the 1991 Act, together with the exercise of the Secretary of State's functions in respect of the subsequent sale of the port to which the scheme relates. The Secretary of State also intends to have particular regard to the policy considerations set out below before making a transfer scheme himself under section 12 of the 1991 Act or subsequently approving the sale of a port to which such a scheme relates.

## 1. Essential Criteria 

  * **Community participation**  
The Secretary of State will not approve an application for the sale of a trust port under the 1991 Act unless the sale is considered likely to deliver an enduring and significant level of community participation in the port. Such participation could take a variety of forms, but must include the ability to influence the port's long term development and may include the right to receive a share in the profits of the port, or the future increase in its value. It does not necessarily require a community role in the operation of the port.
  * **Future investment in, and development of, the port**  
The Secretary of State will not approve an application unless the sale is considered likely to deliver an ownership model with the capability and access to capital to meet future investment needs and to exploit development potential of the port.
  * **Fair price**  
The Secretary of State will not approve an application unless the sale is considered likely to represent good value for money, having regard not only to Exchequer proceeds and market conditions, but also to other benefits including those to the community and the wider economy.
  * **Fair competition**  
The Secretary of State will not approve an application that is likely to deliver an ownership model which results in unsatisfactory levels of competition in the relevant sector.

## 2. Highly Desirable criteria

  * **Transport networks**  
It is highly desirable for an application to be likely to deliver an ownership model which will cause the port to be operated so as to contribute to reliable, resilient and efficient transport networks.
  * **Sale process**  
It is highly desirable that the sale should be conducted in such a way as to give all bona fide prospective purchasers a fair and equitable opportunity to participate.

## 3. Desirable criteria

  * **Employee involvement**  
It is desirable for an application to be likely to deliver port employee participation in the ownership of the port, such as the right to receive equity shares or a share in its future success******.

******This is without prejudice to the Ports Act 1991 section 5(3) requirement to have particular regard to the desirability of encouraging the disposal of the whole or a substantial part of the equity share capital of the successor company to managers or other persons employed by the port company etc.

The DSA is a trading fund which is funded by the fees received from customers, which are set at a level to recover its costs. The DSA therefore has a duty to ensure its costs are kept at the minimum possible level in the interests of its customers, while maintaining standards of service.  That means being as efficient as possible in every area of work and considering closely any areas of spending which may not be necessary

Following a review of its operations the DSA has decided to close its area office at Caradog House in Cardiff.

The office has 87 staff who provide administrative support for DSA within Wales, the South of England and London areas - mainly in deployment of examiners, customer service and test centre property management and procurement activities. 

Staff have been informed of the decision.  There will now be a period of consultation with trade unions.  The consultation will be completed by 19 April 2011.

Possible redeployment options for the staff concerned are being explored. It is intended to retain a small office to support some operational staff in the area. Other responsibilities will be transferred to DSA's headquarters in Nottingham and northern area office in Newcastle.

Closure of Caradog House will not affect testing provision in Wales and the DSA will continue to provide services under its agreed Welsh Language Scheme.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/penning-20101216,94,"**Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Mike Penning):** The United Kingdom is fortunate to have strong and effective front-line Search and Rescue capabilities, many of which are provided by volunteers, including some 3,500 volunteer Coastguards carrying out coastal rescues, the lifeboats operated by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and the volunteer Mountain Rescue Teams. I would like to pay tribute to the dedication and commitment of these volunteers who provide a long-standing example of the contribution that individuals can make to the society in which they live.

Our front-line Search and Rescue services could not, however, function effectively and save the lives that they do without effective arrangements to identify and manage incidents, including directing the best placed and most suitable rescue assets to the scene. These arrangements are provided through our regular Coastguard officers who also monitor ship movements around our coasts, provide information and services to seafarers and recreational water users, operate Vessel Traffic Monitoring Schemes in some locations, including the English Channel, contribute to counter-pollution activities in our waters and support our volunteer Coastguard force. They are currently located in 18 Maritime Rescue Coordination Centres around the UK.

The Coastguard has a long and distinguished history.  But in common with all public services it cannot stand still. Our seas are becoming busier with larger ships and increasing numbers of offshore renewable energy platforms, making key areas of our seas more congested. There are also increasing numbers of people using our beaches, coastlines and seas for leisure activities.

The current organisation of the Coastguard - which dates back some forty years - is not well placed to respond to these challenges.  The lack of national coordination between the centres can result in limited resilience and an uneven distribution of the workload, especially during busy periods. 

The latest technologies offer opportunities to address these issues and to modernise the Coastguard enabling it to deliver a more integrated and improved level of service, at lower cost, with better-rewarded staff taking on increased responsibilities and with enhanced career opportunities.

With these objectives in mind, I am today launching a 14 week consultation about the modernisation of the Coastguard Service. The consultation document, which is available in the Libraries of the House and on the Maritime and Coastguard Agency website [www.mcga.gov.uk](http://www.mcga.gov.uk/), sets out proposals to:

  * Establish two nationally networked Maritime Operations Centres, located at Aberdeen and the Southampton/Portsmouth area, capable of managing maritime incidents wherever and whenever they occur and with improved information systems, together with a 24 hour centre at Dover looking over the busy Channel Traffic Separation Scheme.
  * Provide for five other sub-centres, fully integrated into the national network around the coast and operating during daylight hours. On the basis of an evaluation of the existing sites and the facilities available at them, it is proposed three of these should be located at Falmouth, Humber and Swansea.  We also require sub-centres at either Belfast or Liverpool and either Stornoway or Shetland. The case for selection between these locations is more marginal. We are therefore inviting comments and information about factors that should influence the choice of sites for these two sub-centres.
  * Provide high quality and demanding jobs for our Coastguards, with the job weight and pay reflecting the increased demands placed upon them in line with Civil Service pay guidelines.
  * Strengthen the leadership and support provided to our volunteer Coastguards in the Coastguard Rescue Service.
  * Improve present levels of service to the public while reducing costs.

The proposals do not affect the small centre operated by the Coastguard alongside the Port of London Authority on the Thames in London. 

These changes will strengthen the Coastguard service by dealing with potential points of weakness in current structures and adding resilience throughout the system while also maintaining strong regional links and enhancing front-line rescue services through the volunteer Coastguard.

Last week I met the working group established to conduct the review and we agreed a set of high level findings and next steps. This group included members of the motorcycle industry, trainers, riders' representatives, road safety and local authority bodies as well as DSA and DfT officials. I will be placing the report on the Departments website www.dft.gov.uk and in the Libraries of the House.

While there is more work to be done on the detail, the review has helpfully identified a set of changes to the test which have the potential to deliver my objectives for a new motorcycle test.  My goal is to see the practical test delivered as a single on-road event in a way which will maintain riding standards, protect safety and increase accessibility of the test to all candidates. The work delivered by the group includes a new hazard avoidance manoeuvre which - subject to further trialling - can be carried out on the road, as well as ways to perform the other specified manoeuvres on the road. The working group has also suggested that the slow manoeuvres (manual handling, slalom, figure of eight, U turn and slow ride) might better be examined at training centres, ahead of the main test, by delegated examiners employed by the training industry. It could be followed by a single event on road test conducted by DSA, including the remaining manoeuvres and the other elements of the road based test. This approach needs further development with the training industry. 

The next step for the review will be to hold wider trials, with test-level candidates, to verify the standards, suitability and safety of the new manoeuvres, including a number of on road sites, to establish the criteria for safe on road testing. This will be followed by public consultation on the proposed changes. We will aim to implement a new test by the end of 2011 or early 2012, including on road testing initially in priority areas which are poorly served by the current network of off road test centres. Any changes to the manoeuvres would be implemented for all tests at all locations. Subject to further work on safety, cost and value for money, there would be a phased introduction of on-road testing moving to general adoption as soon as possible. Changes to the test will need to be monitored and kept under review to ensure that the review objectives are delivered in practice.

I am grateful to the members of this group for their work and note that many of them have given up their own time to contribute to the review.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/penning-20110113,96,"**Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Mike Penning):** I am today publishing a consultation document which sets out the Government's proposals for implementing Part 3 of the Equality Act 2010 in respect of ships and hovercraft.

Part 3 of the Equality Act 2010 deals with discrimination, victimisation and harassment in the provision of services and the exercise of public functions. Bringing clarity and uniformity to anti-discrimination legislation as it applies to transporting people by ship or hovercraft and a service provided on such vessels is necessary as the scope and the territorial application of such legislation is far from clear. People receiving services onboard ships and hovercraft should, as far as it is reasonable to do so, have the same protection as they would on land.

Nevertheless, discrimination onboard ships and hovercraft is not reported as being a significant problem. So the intended policy approach is to maintain, as far as it is reasonable to do so, the protection which already exists against both direct and indirect discrimination, harassment and victimisation but to make the scope and extent of the legislation much simpler and clearer. Anti-discrimination legislation, in respect of the protected characteristic of disability, will however be strengthened in relation to ships and hovercraft when the EU Regulation on the rights of passengers travelling by sea and inland waterway comes into force in the UK.

This consultation will assist Government in determining how Part 3 is to apply to ships and hovercraft in relation to the actual service of transporting people and the provision of services onboard such vessels as well as those matters relating to performance of a public function in so far as it relates to disability discrimination.

The Government seek interested parties' views on the proposals. The consultation document and the impact assessment are available on the Department for Transport's website. Copies of these documents have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.

I am pleased to inform the House that the Irish Transport Minister and I have now reached an understanding on the reform of the funding of the Commissioners of Irish Lights.

The Commissioners of Irish Lights is the general lighthouse authority which has provided marine aids to navigation for the benefit of mariners visiting and passing the shores of the whole island of Ireland for hundreds of years. The organisation has come to symbolise the close friendship and shared history of our nations.

For many years, the funding of the Commissioners of Irish Lights work has been a joint undertaking, its costs being met primarily from light dues income from commercial shipping raised in both our jurisdictions and paid into the General Lighthouse Fund.

This funding mechanism has been the subject of debate for a number of years and there have been calls to facilitate a more equitable arrangement, whereby the costs of the work of the Commissioners in the Republic of Ireland is funded solely from sources of income there.

The Irish Transport Minister and I have reached an understanding that we will aim to see the Commissioners of Irish Lights self-financing by 2015-16. This understanding will facilitate the long-term sustainable funding of the Commissioners of Irish Lights and ensure the continued co-operation of the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland in the provision of marine aids to navigation.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/penning-20110203,98,"**Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Mike Penning):** The Department for Transport has today published a consultation on proposals for changes to the driver medical standards on eyesight, epilepsy and diabetes.

The current driver licensing rules in the UK are based on the second European Council Directive on driving licences (91/439/EEC). The minimum medical standards for the issue of driving licences are detailed in Annex III of the second directive and the forthcoming third European Directive on driving licences. Officials and medical experts from across the European Union reviewed the standards for eyesight, diabetes and epilepsy. Following receipt of their reports to the European Commission, amendments to the standards were adopted in 2009 in directives 2009/112/EC and 2009/113/EC, and came into force 15 September 2010. 

The Secretary of State's experts on the Honorary Medical Advisory Panels for eyesight, diabetes and neurology have considered the medical directives and how these compare with existing UK standards. For the most part the medical directives relax or more precisely define existing EU minimum medical standards. While UK standards must be at least at the level of a minimum standard we are not required by EU law to relax existing domestic standards where these are higher than the EU standards. However, where the Panel has advised that a relaxation is consistent with road safety we are recommending that this is adopted. The implementation of these revised standards is the basis of the consultation.

The consultation period will run until 28 April 2011. Copies of the consultation document have been placed on the Library of the House. Further copies are available on the DfT and DVLA websites at www.dft.gov.uk or www.dvla.gov.uk. Depending on comments received and the Department's response, amendment for any change will be made to regulations or guidance issued to medical practitioners.

Amending Regulations have been drafted, and work is in train to ensure that these amending Regulations take account of representations made. However, consideration of the impact of these regulations on business will take time and is unlikely to be completed until May at the earliest.

Accordingly, I am laying before the House a Statutory Instrument which will delay the commencement provisions of SI 2010 No. 1228 for a further six months (until the next Common Commencement Date, which is 1 October 2011), to ensure that the provisions of SI 2010 No. 1228 do not come into force on 1 April in their unamended form.

",Department for Transport,Merchant Shipping (Ship-to-Ship Transfers) Regulations 2010,30 March 2011,"Written statement by Mike Penning MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport",Mike Penning MP,2011-03-30,Written statement,"Shipping, UK shipping industry"
http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/penning-20110330b,101,"**The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Mike Penning)**: The Department for Transport has today published a consultation on a proposal to allow a 2.05 metre increase in the length of semi-trailers and a maximum overall length for articulated heavy goods vehicles of 18.75 metres. The current maximum permitted length of an articulated heavy goods vehicle is 16.5 metres, and the maximum length of semi-trailer compatible with that overall limit is 13.6 metres. However, the current maximum permitted length for a rigid vehicle/drawbar trailer combination is already 18.75 metres, so the new proposed maximum length for articulated goods vehicles would not mean longer vehicles than are already circulating on Britain's roads.

The proposal is based on research findings and an Impact Assessment. It would be a relaxation of the current regulatory requirement on the road haulage industry. The Government accepts the research findings which show it could have a significant potential net benefit to road haulage as well as wider benefits in terms of reductions in congestion, local air pollution, carbon emissions, accidents, noise and infrastructure costs.

In June 2009, following earlier work on longer, heavier vehicles, the Department for Transport commissioned a detailed study into the feasibility and impacts of allowing the use of longer semi-trailers in GB, within the existing weight limit of 44 tonnes gross vehicle weight (GVW). The primary objective was to establish whether the introduction of these high-volume semi-trailers would deliver overall economic, environmental and societal benefits or disbenefits.

The study considered two main possibilities: increasing the length of a semi-trailer by up to one metre to 14.6 metre in total, or increasing it by up to 2.05 metres. The latter option would increase the maximum permitted length of a semi-trailer to 15.65 metres, which would provide the same loading length as an existing rigid truck/drawbar trailer combination.

The study also considered the possibility of increasing the overall maximum permitted length of an articulated lorry to 18.75 metres. This would enable the development and use of tractor units with safer, more aerodynamic frontal designs in addition to high-volume semi-trailers.

Based on the findings of the study, the Government believes there is a good case for permitting both an increase of up to 2.05 metres in the length of semi-trailers and an increase in the overall permitted length of articulated vehicles to 18.75 metres. The existing weight limit of 44 tonnes GVW will remain in force. The consultation will enable the Department to develop a better understanding of the practical implications on road users generally of such an increase and to identify proportionate mitigation measures to minimise the risk of unintended adverse consequences. Depending on the outcome of the consultation, the Government will consider permitting the operation of high-volume semi-trailers on a trial basis pending the introduction of the necessary changes to current Regulations.  This trial could be helpful to determine whether or not mitigation measures are required.

The consultation will run until 21 June 2011. Copies of the Consultation Document have been placed on the Library of the House. Further copies are available on the DfT website at [www.dft.gov.uk](http://www.dft.gov.uk/). Depending on comments received and the Department's response, amendments may be made to regulations.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/penning-20110405,102,"**The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Mike Penning)**: I wish to inform the House that the Government has decided not to opt in to the proposed Directive facilitating cross-border enforcement in the field of road safety at this stage.

The draft Directive intends to improve enforcement of certain road traffic offences committed using vehicles registered in another Member State. It aims to facilitate the exchange of registered keeper data between Member States' registration authorities, to help identify offenders.

While broadly supportive of the objectives behind this measure, the UK did not opt in to the Directive because, on balance, it did not appear to be in the UK's interests to do so at this stage.

In the UK we prosecute drivers for road traffic offences, rather than vehicle keepers. Given that the Directive only provides for the exchange of vehicle keeper information, we had concerns around our ability to effectively pursue fines against the drivers of the vehicles, in the absence of effective provision to compel foreign registered keepers to disclose who was driving the vehicle when the offence was committed.

We questioned the interaction of the Directive with the Prum Council Decisions, which the UK has signed up to, but not yet implemented, (""Prum"" provides for the exchange of keeper data between Member States in relation to criminal offences) and were concerned about how the necessary data protection mechanisms could be enforced.

Additionally, we did not consider that a fine would have enough of a deterrent effect to bring about increased behavioural change, since domestically, research shows that it is the fear of points on a licence, or losing the licence altogether which have the main effect on increasing compliance.

We also had concerns around affordability. There would be significant start-up and running costs were our police to use keeper information obtained under the proposed Directive for enforcement purposes.

Not opting in at this stage will give us the opportunity to carefully scrutinise the actual costs for setup and implementation of this Directive across Member States, informing any future decision on a possible post-adoption opt-in, which the Government will look at longer term.

A decision not to opt in to this particular Directive does not prevent the UK from engaging with the EU on other matters relating to road safety nor cooperating on enforcement and exchanging data where there are strong, mutual interests for this. The UK continues to plays a prominent part in developing EU strategy in these areas. We also expect that we will be able to continue to play a part in negotiating the final text of the Directive.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/penning-20110513,103,"**Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Mike Penning):** I have today laid before the House draft affirmative Regulations which, if approved, will apply Part 5 (Work) of the Equality Act 2010 to work on ships and hovercraft and to seafarers.

The Regulations will ensure that, as far as possible, the level of protection afforded under Part 5 of the Equality Act 2010 is extended to those working at sea.  This was not done at the time that Part 5 of the Equality Act 2010 was commenced because further consideration needed to be given to the issue of seafarers' pay.

 As the law currently stands, section 9 of the Race Relations Act, 1976, provides that it is not unlawful for seafarers to be paid different rates of pay on the basis of their nationality if they were recruited outside Great Britain. This includes seafarers from EEA States and designated States, which are States with particular bilateral agreements with the European Union. The European Commission has been investigating a complaint that UK law does not comply with European Law and in January this year it issued a Reasoned Opinion on that basis.  In order to meet its Treaty obligations, the Government is obliged to bring UK law into line with European law.

The Regulations which I have laid before the House today will, if approved, apply Part 5 of the Equality Act to work on ships and hovercraft and to seafarers. The Government is already committed to the Equality Act 2010, most of which, including Part 5, was commenced on 1 October 2010.  The international nature of the shipping industry requires further clarity in specifying to which seafarers, working on which vessels, operating in which waters, Part 5 of the Act applies. The relevant provisions legislate in respect of employment, offering protection from discrimination, harassment and victimisation in relation to certain protected characteristics, these being age, disability, gender reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion and belief, sex and sexual orientation.  Section 81 of the Act contains the power to achieve this by means of an affirmative statutory instrument.

The power within section 81 of the Act is also wide enough to legislate in respect of differential pay.  The Regulations will, if approved, provide that it is not unlawful to offer to pay or pay different rates of pay to seafarers (applicants, employees and contract workers), other than those from EEA or designated states, if a person applies for work as a seafarer or is recruited as a seafarer outside Great Britain.

Under section 19 of the Equality Act 2010 (indirect discrimination), where an apparently neutral provision, criterion or practice has an effect which particularly disadvantages seafarers from EEA or designated states in terms of a difference in pay, this will nevertheless be lawful if the employer can show that the provision, criterion or practice is objectively justified.  If differential pay were challenged by a seafarer from an EEA or designated State, it would be for the employer to satisfy an employment tribunal as to that justification.

The Government has consulted with ship owners and the Chamber of Shipping as well as the Trades Unions before proceeding with this measure and has prepared an Impact Assessment.  In preparing these Regulations, we have applied the principles of our Reducing Regulation initiative and taken every care to ensure that the Regulations meet the requirements of EU law without unwarranted elaboration, the better to safeguard the continued competitiveness of the UK fleet.  We remain committed to the Red Ensign and to maintaining a sizeable, high quality and highly competitive fleet under the UK flag.

In accordance with Government policy on transforming the role of regulation in our society and reducing regulation, these Regulations will be reviewed every five years and the conclusions of such reviews will be published.

These Regulations will apply in England, Wales and Scotland while Northern Ireland will shortly be introducing similar regulations.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/penning-20110519,104,"**Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Mike Penning)**: Today, I am publishing the preliminary report on investigation and closure procedures for motorway incidents.  The joint review carried out by my Department, the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), the Highways Agency (HA), and the Home Office, looked at what needs to be done to reduce the duration of motorway closure incidents and help keep our motorways moving.  The report can be found on my Department's website - [www.dft.gov.uk](http://www.dft.gov.uk/) and an electronic copy has been lodged with the House library.

As set out within my Department's Business Plan, the review supports this Government's vision for a transport system which is an engine for economic growth, and its commitment to tackling the causes of congestion and unreliability on the strategic road network.

Motorway closures in England costs the economy around £1 billion a year, which is an unacceptable brake on the country's economic recovery.  Tackling the causes of congestion and keeping traffic moving is a vital element in securing the UK's prosperity.

As such, we completed a review of motorway closure incidents, to identify what improvements could be made to achieve the shortest timeline possible for managing such incidents.

The review led by this Department makes ten recommendations, the delivery of which will ensure that there is overall improvement in the time taken to reopen motorways following an incident. The recommendations are contained within the report.

I am also announcing DfT funding of around £3 million for laser scanning technology that can be used by the police for surveying incident scenes.  Recent trials by the police and HA have demonstrated that this can make a real difference in speeding up the investigation process. The £3m will be used to set up a fund which police forces can bid from to put towards the purchase of this technology. The fund will take a match funding approach thereby potentially enabling a larger number of forces to purchase and use this equipment across the strategic road network and local road network.

Later today, I will be chairing a national summit with representatives from all key incident management parties to discuss the review's findings, and to formally agree the high-level action plan on the way forward.  The majority of the review's recommendations are expected to be completed by the end of the year, and we remain on track to deliver on a further business plan commitment to set up and implement measures to reduce congestion caused by incidents by December 2012.  I am confident that by having open dialogue and by continuing to work closely with the emergency services and colleagues across Government in this collaborative manner, we can manage incidents effectively, efficiently and consistently.

As I explained in my Written Ministerial Statement on 30 March, amending Regulations have been drafted, and work is in train to ensure that these amending Regulations take account of representations made - including representations arising from an extension, over the period 9 February to 10 March 2011, of the review of the _Merchant Shipping (Ship-to-Ship Transfers) Regulations 2010_ for the benefit of Suffolk residents and bodies.

The conclusion which I drew from the main review which was carried out in July-September 2010 was that the provisions prohibiting all ship-to-ship transfers outside harbour authority areas will be replaced by provisions restricting ship-to-ship transfers outside harbour authority areas to a single designated area within the UK Territorial Sea and establishing a system of permits issued by the MCA, giving effect at the same time to the new chapter 8 of Annex I to the MARPOL Convention.

Having taken account of all the representations made, both in the main review and in the extension of the review in February and March, I have again come to the conclusion that this is the appropriate course of action and that the designated area for ship-to-ship transfers (other than in harbour authority waters) shall be the waters off the Suffolk coast where ship-to-ship transfers are already carried out.

The recognition of these waters off the Suffolk coast as a suitable area for carrying out ship-to-ship transfers is based on the Maritime and Coastguard Agency's and the industry's actual experience of the successful use of these waters for ship-to-ship transfer operations over a number of years without pollution of the seas and coasts. The MCA will continue to monitor such operations closely to ensure they are carried out to the highest possible safety standards.

I shall place an addition to the analytical table previously provided in December 2010, which summarises the points of substance made in the written representations and the meetings held with interested parties during the period of the extension of the review in February and March, in the libraries of both Houses and on the Department's website.

As I also indicated in my Written Ministerial Statement on 30 March, the amended _Merchant Shipping (Ship-to-Ship Transfers) Regulations 2010 _are intended to come into force on 1 October 2011. In common with other new domestic secondary legislation, these Regulations will contain provisions setting an automatic expiry date and requiring them to be reviewed in a specified number of years.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/penning-20110622,106,"**Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Mike Penning)**: The Government's principal objective in supporting merchant navy training is to facilitate an adequate supply of UK maritime expertise to meet the nation's economic and strategic requirements, by assisting organisations providing merchant navy training. In this difficult economic period, the Government has decided that it is right to review the continuing requirement for Government support for training and skills development in this sector and how best to spend any continuing Government funding.

In my Written Ministerial Statement of 8 December 2010 [_Official Report_, cols 24-26WS] I announced my intention to commission a review and I can confirm that today I have launched an invitation to tender. The successful bidder will present its findings to an independent panel, which will report to me by the end of the year and make practical recommendations on how the economic requirement for trained seafarers in the UK can be best met, having regard to current financial constraints.

The terms of reference for the review are as follows:

  * to review the UK requirement for trained seafarers at sea over the next decade;
  * to review the UK requirement for trained seafarers ashore over the next decade;
  * to examine the extent to which the above requirements have to be met by UK seafarers;
  * to review the effectiveness and efficiency of the existing funding arrangements and the future need for Government intervention to ensure the supply of trained seafarers;
  * to identify options for supporting the training of seafarers and make recommendations which address the issue of value for money and are reflective of future UK requirements for trained seafarers;
  * to examine whether previous training targets are reflective of future needs.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/penning-20110622b,107,"**Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Mike Penning):** This Statement is to inform the House that following closure of the roadside facilities policy consultation on 2 July last year, I have reviewed the responses and am introducing a change to the policy to permit the development of truckstops on the motorway network. 

The consultation identified strong support from the haulage industry for the development of truckstops.  Proposals for dedicated truckstop facilities will now be considered in the context of existing and/or proposed rest facilities on the strategic road network, and will be determined on their individual merit.  This will include truckstop facilities that can be accessed direct from motorways - Motorway Truckstops - which are a type of facility not permitted until now. Where there is evidence to demonstrate that demand for lorry parking exceeds supply, the development of truckstop facilities at existing service areas would be viewed favourably. Proposals for Motorway Truckstops are unlikely to be supported if they would prevent a potential motorway service area (MSA) being built. 

Detailed advice on the mandatory and permitted features of all categories of truckstop is set out in the table that is attached at Appendix 1 to the written copy of my Statement.

These changes supplement DfT Circular 01/2008 (April 2008).  Aspects of policy not touched on in this Statement will continue to apply.****

I am currently considering ways to reduce regulation, increase competition and improve still further the quality of motorway service areas. To this end, I have instructed officials in my department to identify those elements of the policy that might instead be better determined at a local level through the current planning system. 

I have also instructed my officials to work with the Department for Communities and Local Government to consider how best to take these issues forward in the context of the National Planning Policy Framework. Separately, we will produce an associated DfT technical note, setting out requirements in respect of road safety and operational issues. 

This approach accords with the Government's twin aims of decentralisation and localism, reducing the burden of bureaucracy and strengthening local accountability.  It will encourage competition and, through this, improve service for users.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/penning-20110630,108,"**The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Mike Penning):  **I am publishing today, a consultation paper on proposals to change the charging regime at the Dartford-Thurrock River Crossing. The proposals concern new possible charging rates according to type of vehicle using the Crossing.

The Dartford-Thurrock River Crossing is a key part of the strategic road network. It consists of two two-lane tunnels carrying traffic to the north, and a four-lane cable stayed bridge (the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge) carrying traffic to the south. The Crossing spans the River Thames between Dartford and Thurrock, forming a trunk road link (the A282 Trunk Road) in the M25 orbital motorway.

A road user charge has been collected at the Crossing since 2003, using the powers in the Transport Act 2000, in order to manage the high demand for use of the Crossing. The Department for Transport (DfT) revised the charging regime in 2008 following public consultation. Details of the current charging regime are set out in the A282 Trunk Road (Dartford-Thurrock Crossing Charging Scheme) Order 2008 (Statutory Instrument No. 1951).

In recognition of the strategic importance of the Crossing the Government is committed to tackling the current and forecast performance issues affecting the Crossing. As part of the spending review, the Department announced that, subject to consultation, prices would increase from £1.50 to £2.00 in 2011 for cars, rising to £2.50 in 2012 and that prices for other vehicles would also increase. The proposal to increase the charges at the Crossing is both a measure to manage demand and to help to fund transport investment. For this reason I am today launching a consultation on proposals to change the charges.

The consultation makes reference to, but does not include detailed proposals for, other short, medium and long term measures to be taken forward in this spending review period in relation to the Crossing. In the short term we are announcing an initial six month trial of a protocol for suspension of the charges during periods when the severity of congestion is such as to constitute an emergency, and charge suspension would help to ease that congestion.

In the medium term our objectives are, the introduction of a free flow charging scheme and a review of options for additional crossing capacity.

I am pleased to announce that the consultation will run until 23rd September 2011. Everybody with an interest is invited to take part. A consultation document and instructions for responding can be found on my Department's website. An electronic copy has been lodged with the House library. A public notice marking the publication of these proposals will be posted in the _London Gazette_ and the _Dartford Messenger_ on the 30th June and in the _Thurrock Gazette_ on the 1st July and copies of all the documents will be made available for public inspection at the offices of Dartford Borough Council and Thurrock Council.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/penning-20110707,109,"**The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Mike Penning):** The Department for Transport is today launching a consultation on the proposal to remove its objection to lifting a grant condition which precludes the use of the City of Liverpool Cruise Terminal for 'turnaround' operations - that is, the beginning and/or end of a cruise voyage. 

This condition, which limits use of the terminal to port-of-call visits only, was originally imposed on the grant for the Terminal, which opened in 2007, by the North West Development Agency because of concerns expressed by the Department about potentially unfair competition with other cruise terminals which have not received such public subsidy.

The Peel Ports terminal at Langton Dock in Liverpool may currently be used for turnaround operations, but it is argued that it is an unattractive prospect - both aesthetically and operationally - and has already lost traffic as a result. 

Liverpool City Council is proposing to make a partial repayment of the grant, staged over 15 years, amounting to approximately £5.3 million, in return for lifting the turnaround prohibition. This amount is abated from the original grant funding to take account of the time that the Terminal will have operated with the restriction, and the fact that port-of-call visits will continue to deliver the benefits for which the grant was originally made.

It will be for Liverpool City Council to satisfy the European Commission, if necessary, that having regard to the continuing regional benefits from overall operations at the Terminal, no parallel repayment of European funding is required. 

I consider that the repayment proposal by Liverpool City Council can be justified taking into account the prospective regeneration and other benefits to the Merseyside area and, on this basis, I am consulting on the possibility of removing the objection. I am inviting comments by 15 September and will then consider responses carefully before arriving at a final decision.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/penning-20110915,111,"**The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Mike Penning**): As part of the Comprehensive Spending Review that the Government set out last October, we announced the intention to consult with interested parties about a review of the Maritime Incident Response Group (MIRG) funded by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA).

Since it was established in 2006, the MIRG has responded to just six fire incidents and has not had a significant impact on the outcome of any of those. Since February the MCA has consulted those Fire and Rescue Services providing the current MIRG capability.

Feedback from the shipping industry suggests that the most valued service provided by the MIRG is their initial fire assessment advice. The MCA had therefore initially hoped that the Fire and Rescue Services providing the current MIRG capability would be able to provide such a service, but agreement on this has not been possible. The Government therefore intends to establish alternative arrangements for such a fire assessment and advice service using commercial salvors.

Under the new arrangements professional personnel will be deployed to an incident to make an assessment of the status of a fire and to provide advice on the best course of action and - as in many cases today - reassure port authorities that a ship can be safely accepted into a port so that shore based fire fighters can attend to the fire. This approach recognises that international legislation already requires that all ships' crews are trained and equipped to fight fires on ships.

The new service will not require funding from the public purse as costs will be recoverable. A 90 day notice period will begin today and the existing MIRG arrangement will end on 14 December 2011.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/penning-20111011,112,"**The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Mike Penning):** Further to my [statement](http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/penning-20110330b) of 30 March 2011 (Official Report col 23WS), the Department for Transport has today published its [response](http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/dft-2011-06) to the consultation on a proposal to allow a 2.05 metre increase in the length of semi-trailers and a maximum overall length for articulated heavy goods vehicles of 18.75 metres.

The research underlying the consultation proposal suggests that high volume semi-trailers have potential environmental, safety and congestion benefits: they would allow up to 13% more loading space than current articulated lorries, resulting in fewer journeys needed to transport the same volume of goods.

The research predicts that by 2015 this would reduce lorry miles in the UK by 100 - 180 million a year, meaning reduced congestion, reduced air pollution and reduced carbon emissions (by around 100,000 tonnes a year reduction). The research also found that there would be a net decrease in casualties of around 1.6% from the reduction in lorry miles.

However, the evidence provided during the consultation exercise has identified a number of areas which merit additional investigation.These include possible effects if the number of longer semi-trailers introduced is significantly higher than that predicted by the research and the impact assessment attached to the consultation document; the impacts of longer semi-trailers on road infrastructure and design and on depot and distribution centre infrastructure and design; the impacts on SMEs of allowing longer semi-trailers; and the effectiveness of additional vision/sensor/safety systems fitted to improve detection of vulnerable road users.

The research underlying the consultation proposals was comprehensive. To gather further evidence on such impacts will therefore require a trial of longer semi-trailers in operation. The Department therefore intends to proceed with an operational trial of longer semi-trailers in order to gather practical evidence. Trailers taking part in the trial will operate under Vehicle Special Orders issued under Section 44 of the Road Traffic Act 1988.

The Department considers that the number of vehicles permitted in the trial will need to be limited, but that the number permitted should still allow meaningful evidence to be gathered on the likely take-up of longer semi-trailers across the vehicle fleet as well as their impact on infrastructure. This would require a trial of vehicle numbers that allows operators to swap a sufficient percentage of their fleet over to the longer semi-trailer to enable them to remove standard trailers from their fleet and make an effective comparison of performance.

The responses to the consultation also indicate that different businesses would wish to choose between additional trailer lengths of up to 1m and up to 2.05m, depending on the nature of their business. The trial provides an opportunity to validate the impacts of each length. The current trailer parc for articulated vehicle above 40 tonnes in the UK is estimated at around 100,000 trailers. The Department intends to proceed with a trial of up to 900 trailers of an increased length of up to 2.05m; and 900 trailers of an increased length of up to 1m, 1,800 trailers forming just under 2% of trailers on British roads.

Our baseline research shows that the ability to operate longer semi trailers would provide clear benefits to business and a spur to efficiency and growth. We expect the trial itself to offer a net present value of £33m, largely due to the financial benefits operators should see over the 10 year length of the trial (around £1,800 per vehicle per year). We would expect many of these benefits to flow through to the consumer.

Participation in the trial will be on a voluntary basis and at the participants' own risk; there is no guarantee that the use of the longer semi-trailers will continue to be permitted beyond the end of the trial period. The trial will run for 10 years, to allow those businesses wishing to participate the opportunity to cover the costs of investment in the longer semi-trailers. Expressions of Interest are invited from today, with the trial starting in January 2012. Information on how to apply can be found on the DfT website.

However, the Department wishes the trial to be closely monitored, to ensure that any significant issues, particularly on safety, that arise are addressed quickly and to ensure that the trial is meeting the Department's objectives.

The Department will therefore appoint an independent contractor to monitor and review trial progress. The contractor will report to the Department on a four monthly basis; at the end of each trial year the Department will review progress towards objectives, including considering any changes to the length of the trial and the numbers of trailers involved in the trial.

Although many of the responses from vehicle operators supported the development of tractor units with a safer more aerodynamic frontal design, it was evident from the majority of responses received from vehicle manufacturers that they are unlikely to progress with the development of improved frontal designs at this time. Therefore, the Department has decided not to include tractor units with an extension of up to 0.4 metres for improved frontal designs in the trial. However, we are keeping the situation under review.

I am also publishing, on the Department's website, a written response to the consultation and an updated version of the Appraisal of Sustainability that had been published as part of the consultation process.

The ports industry is a vital contributor to this country's economic recovery and success. Well over 90% of trade by tonnage passes through sea ports, and so the importance of a clear planning framework for their future sustainable development can hardly be overstated.

The NPS gives full prominence to the importance of development in sympathy with the environment, while also stressing the national need for developers' commercial judgements to be respected in what continues to be a successful, market-oriented and responsible sector.

It has been agreed with the House that the same procedure as proposed in the Localism Bill will be followed for the NPS. The Secretary of State intends to designate the NPS after a period of 21 sitting days has elapsed, or following a debate in the House of Commons if the House wishes one, and approves the NPS, within that period.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/penning-20111103,114,"**The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Mike Penning):** The Department for Transport has today published a consultation on a proposal to exempt vehicles of historic interest (vehicles manufactured prior to 1 January 1960) in Great Britain (GB) from statutory MoT test, as allowed under Article 4(2) of the EU Directive 2009/40/EC.

The EU Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council, Chapter II, Exceptions, Article 4 states: ""_Member States may, after consulting the Commission, exclude from the scope of this Directive, or subject to special provisions, certain vehicles operated or used in exceptional conditions and vehicles which are never, or hardly ever, used on public highways, including vehicles of historic interest which were manufactured before 1 January 1960 or which are temporarily withdrawn from circulation.  Member States may, after consulting the Commission, set their own testing standards for vehicles considered to be of historic interest._""

Sections 45 to 48 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 provide the legislative basis for MoT testing.  The purpose of the MoT test is to ensure that cars, other light vehicles (including some light goods vehicles), private buses and motorcycles over a prescribed age are checked at least once a year to see that they comply with key roadworthiness and environmental requirements in the Road Vehicle Construction and Use Regulations 1986 and the Road Vehicle Lighting Regulations 1989 (both as amended).

Whilst it is important to ensure that vehicles are safe to use on the highway, it is also important to ensure that regulations imposed are not excessive.  Currently, both the age and the categories of vehicles requiring the MoT test in GB go further than the EU Directive on roadworthiness test 2009/40/EC, which only subjects post-1960 registered vehicles to a compulsory roadworthiness test and does not require motorcycles of any age to do a statutory roadworthiness test.

The Government believes that the proposed exemption will reduce regulatory burden on owners of historic vehicles, meet its Reducing Regulation agenda and the desire to remove unnecessary burdens.  It will also bring the age of vehicles requiring the statutory MoT test in line with The Goods Vehicles (Plating and Testing) Regulations 1988, which already exempts unladen pre-1960 manufactured Heavy Goods Vehicles from the roadworthiness test.

Two-thirds of pre-1960 licensed vehicles (vehicles manufactured prior to 1 January 1960) are driven less than 500 miles each year.  This is significantly less than the 9,000 miles driven on average by all licensed vehicles.

Whilst the pre-1960 licensed vehicles made up about 0.6% of the approximately 35.2m licensed vehicles in GB in 2010, they were involved in just 0.03% of road casualties and accidents.  The pre-1960 licensed vehicles are largely well maintained by their owners.  The initial MoT test failure rate for these vehicles in 2009 was less than 10%, whilst the initial MoT test failure rate for post-1960 licensed vehicles was over 30%.

The purpose of the consultation is to invite views on proposals to exempt vehicles of historic interest from the statutory MoT test in GB.  In addition to no change, the consultation offers three options based on vehicle manufactured date, i.e. it seeks respondents' views on whether the Government should exempt from the statutory MoT test, pre-1960, pre-1945 or pre-1920 manufactured vehicles.

The consultation also seeks respondents' views (in all three options) on whether all vehicle categories and vehicles used for commercial purposes should be included in the exemption review.

The consultation will run until 26 January 2012.  Copies of the Consultation Document have been placed on the Library of the House. Further copies are available on the DfT website at [www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/dft-2011-27](/consultations/dft-2011-27).  Depending on comments received and the Department's response, amendments may be made to regulations.

In recognition of the number of representations made and to allow the Department time to carefully consider the responses further, I can advise that there will be no increase in either November 2011 or April 2012.

A final decision on the timing of future rises and a full response to the consultation will, subject to Cabinet Committee clearance, be announced early next year.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/penning-20111206,116,"**The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Mike Penning):** The rise in the number of incidents involving pirates in certain parts of the world has highlighted the need to ensure UK-flagged vessels are able to adequately protect themselves against such threats. Evidence shows that ships with armed guards are less likely to be attacked and taken for ransom, and the House will be aware that the Prime Minister confirmed last month that the Government now recognises the use of private armed guards as an option to protect UK registered ships and their crews from acts of piracy.  This applies in exceptional circumstances as defined below:

  * when the ship is transiting the high seas throughout the High Risk Area (an area bounded by Suez and the Straights of Hormuz to the North, 10°S and 78°E); _and_
  * the latest ""Best Management Practices"" is being followed fully but, on its own, is not deemed by the shipping company and the ship's master as sufficient to protect against acts of piracy; _and_
  * the use of armed guards is assessed to reduce the risk to the lives and well being of those onboard the ship.

I am therefore today, publishing interim guidance to shipping companies on the use of armed guards onboard UK flagged ships.  This guidance covers, amongst other things, the factors to be included in the risk assessment, advice on selecting a private security company, and a requirement for the shipping company to produce a counter-piracy plan and submit a copy to my Department.

A private security company (PSC) employed to put armed guards onboard UK ships will require authorisation from the Home Office for possession of any prohibited firearms as defined in the Firearms Act 1968 (as amended). Checks will be carried out by the Home Office and Police into the PSC and its personnel before an authorisation is granted.

The guidance to shipping companies, and the Home Office process for authorising the possession of prohibited firearms, are both interim and will be reviewed within 12 months so that they reflect continuing national and international work to ensure high standards in the provision of armed guards in the maritime domain.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/penning-20111207,117,"The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Mike Penning): In conjunction with my Hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Justice, the Member for Huntingdon, I wish to inform the House of serious errors that have been identified in the way in which data on drink drive convictions is shared between the Police, Courts and the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA).

At the end of last year, I asked the DVLA to review communication between the courts and the DVLA. As a result of these investigations it became clear that the alcohol levels for some drink driving convictions were either not provided to the DVLA by the courts, or were inconsistent when there was a delay between the court sending the information and the reconciliation of this information by DVLA. These errors have been happening for more than 20 years. As a result, in some cases, driving licences were reissued to individuals whose ban had expired, but without them undergoing legally required medical tests.

As soon as the problem was reported to me in August 2011, DVLA put in place manual checks so that any court notification received at DVLA without an alcohol reading was immediately investigated and no licences were re-issued without the alcohol level being provided. In addition, DVLA have worked to identify cases where information was incomplete in the backlog of data since 1991.

The Courts and DVLA are now implementing IT changes which will mean that their systems will not allow cases to be processed at either the Courts or DVLA unless valid alcohol readings are provided. Furthermore, new operational guidance has been issued to staff who deal with these cases.

Drivers convicted of drink driving offences with more than two and a half times the permitted legal alcohol limit are regarded as High Risk Offenders (HROs). The law requires that such convicted drivers are required to prove their medical fitness before they can be relicensed at the end of their disqualification period.

As a result of the review DVLA have undertaken, I was informed that some convicted drivers who should have been treated as HROs have been granted a driving licence at the end of their disqualification on the basis of their own declaration of health, without undertaking the required medical assessment.

In total, 265,225 driver records have been found to be missing the relevant information on alcohol levels. Correct alcohol levels have now been obtained for 50,330 of these. We have identified within this group 3,895 drivers who should have been treated as HROs - and therefore should have undergone a medical assessment - before being granted a licence following their disqualification. These drivers present a potential risk to road safety and are being contacted so that they can undergo a medical assessment immediately. Those who fail to comply, or cannot demonstrate their medical fitness to drive, will lose their entitlement to drive.

The Ministry of Justice, Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service, The Scottish Courts Services and the Police are working together urgently to identify the correct alcohol readings for a further 28,830 records. Any further HROs identified from these will also be required to undergo a medical assessment.

We have identified that of the 265,225 cases, some 53,028 relate to convicted drivers who have not yet applied to renew licences. These individuals do not therefore pose an immediate road safety risk. Their records have been blocked to ensure that if they do apply for a licence in future any identified as being HROs will have to undergo the medical assessment before a licence can be issued.

Records retention policy and the time limits set under the terms of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974, means that it will not be possible to act upon the alcohol readings in the remaining 133,037 cases identified. We cannot therefore say how many of these drivers would have been HROs at the time of their conviction.

It is with great regret that I inform the House that we have identified two cases in 1996 and 2006 where a driver who was issued a licence without first proving their medical fitness to drive, has subsequently caused death while driving under the influence of alcohol. Every death on the road is a tragedy and we have the deepest sympathy for anyone affected by the actions of these drink drivers. It is not possible to say whether the drivers in these cases would have got their licences back following a medical examination. Every effort is being made to contact the victims' families to inform them and to ensure they receive full and proper support.

I can assure the House that we regard road safety and ensuring convicted drivers are treated correctly as of critical importance. Everything possible will be done to take action, where we are legally able, against those who represent a risk to other road users. The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Justice and I have ensured that immediate action has been taken to deal with this issue and to make sure it does not happen again. I must make clear that this investigation is continuing but due to the complexity of accessing very old court data, final figures will not be known for a number of months.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/penning-20111213,118,"**The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Mike Penning)**: The DVLA has a long history of providing driver and vehicle licensing support to Great Britain's drivers and motorists and in providing essential services to the police and other agencies to keep our roads safe. But times change and so do the needs of customers. To make sure the DVLA meets those changing needs, I am announcing today the launch of a consultation on a programme of work which will transform the way that the DVLA delivers its services to customers.

This programme will make it easier for motorists to carry out their business with the DVLA. This will be achieved by centralising services and providing much more choice and flexibility around how and when motorists deal with the DVLA. The proposals could deliver significant efficiencies with an estimated £28 million year on year saving.

As a result of these proposals I expect the DVLA to centralise services at its Swansea offices and to deliver those services electronically and in partnership with others. To this end, the DVLA will withdraw from its network of expensive, regionally located offices by the end of 2013. As this proposed centralisation of services is expected to have an impact on resources, the DVLA will now consult staff in these offices and the trade unions on the impact of the changes.

Also, motorists in Northern Ireland currently do not have access to all vehicle services that are available on the mainland, for example, the facility to tax a vehicle online is currently unavailable in NI. As part of this programme, the DVLA will also look to offer the full range of services to motorists in Northern Ireland.

The DVLA will ensure that the motor trade and customers are fully involved in the consultation on the transformation programme and that service delivery will not be adversely affected; rather, the expectation is that for many, services will be enhanced.

I am committed to improving the service all motorists receive while increasing efficiencies. I believe these changes will bring service improvements, better value for money and a faster, more responsive service for customers, while at the same time delivering greater productivity from the DVLA's workforce.

The Petitioners therefore request that the House of Commons urges the Department for Transport not to increase tolls on the Dartford Crossing and to reconsider the emergency measures to lift the barriers during severe congestion and extend the local residents discount scheme. And the Petitioners remain, etc."" [P000960]

Regrettably, the 'Observations by the Secretary of State' published by the Department for Transport on 14 October were incorrect, and related to another petition. The observations should have been as follows:

The Government set out its intention to revise the road user charging regime at the Dartford-Thurrock River Crossing as part of the outcomes of the Government's 2010 Comprehensive Spending Review in October 2010.

Subject to consultation, the Government proposed increasing the levels of road user charges in 2011 and 2012, in order to continue the prioritisation of improvements to the Crossing in the short, medium and longer term. The improvements include the suspension of charges at the times when an emergency exists such as severe congestion, the implementation of new, free-flow, charging technology, and the review of options for additional crossing capacity.

The Department for Transport published for consultation the details of its proposed revisions to the road user charging regime on 30 June 2011 and the consultation period closed on 23 September 2011.

The Department recently announced that there will be no increase in charges in November 2011 or April 2012.

The Department is considering the responses made during the consultation, and will consider carefully all the representations made before making any announcements on its conclusions.

The Highways Agency began a six month trial of an operational charge suspension protocol in July 2011, and it will review the effectiveness of the trial following its conclusion in December 2011.

The consultation was launched on 5th January 2010 in conjunction with a related consultation on Electric Personal Vehicles (EPVs) and ran until 30 March 2010. The EAPC Regulations were also included within the 'Retail' and 'Road Transportation' themes of the 'Red Tape Challenge' which ran from April 7th to June 17th 2011.

The Department has considered the responses and supports recommendations to harmonise power limits (from 200 Watts to 250 Watts) with similar provisions in place across the EU - allowing consumers access to a wider range of electrically assisted cycles.

Regulatory proposals will be developed to update power limits and consider other amendments, for example on weight limits, once EU discussions on a much wider group of 2, 3 and light 4-wheeled vehicles conclude. The outcome of EU discussions could have implications for the regulation of EAPCs, and it would therefore be unhelpful to make amendments at this time which might need to be subsequently repealed.

I have concluded that continuing Government support for maritime training is required. The consultants' findings, accepted by the independent panel, were that there was a good value for money case for the retention of Government funding. Evidence was presented to me showing that for each working year of a seafarer who has benefitted from Government funding, approximately £14,500 in additional output is created relative to that of a UK worker displaying average productivity.

With over 90% of the UK's import and export trade by weight transported by the maritime sector, I believe continuing Government support in this area will reflect our ongoing commitment to economic growth and will help to maintain the competitiveness of this sector.

I have therefore decided to provide a budget of £12million a year for the support for maritime training scheme for the remainder of this Parliament. In view of the forecast national shortage of trained seafarers and the need to develop the next generation of UK officers and ratings, I intend that the majority of the budget be focussed on supporting initial training for cadets studying at junior officer level with the remainder supporting ratings training and ratings to officer conversion training.

I will be making a number of minor changes to the current scheme to achieve greater value for money by maximising the intake of trainees while ensuring more rigorous accountability structures are in place.

These changes are consistent with the Government's wider commitment to improve the transparency and accountability of public spending.

I will also be considering longer-term options to deliver merchant navy training within an overarching skills and apprenticeship framework.

A copy of the consultants' findings and the recommendations made by the independent panel have been placed in the Library of the House.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/penning-20120125,122,"The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Mike Penning): The Department for Transport has today launched a [consultation on a proposed road user charging scheme for heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) of 12 tonnes and over](/consultations/dft-2012-03/). This is one of the commitments in the Coalition Programme for Government.

The proposal's primary objective is to ensure fairer arrangements for UK hauliers. UK-registered HGVs already pay tolls or user charges on motorways and, frequently, other roads in most EU Member States. Save on some specific pieces of infrastructure (the M6 Toll and various bridges and tunnels), there are no tolls or user charges in the UK. As most foreign operators currently purchase their HGVs' fuel outside the UK, they therefore contribute nothing towards the cost of our roads.

A scheme for HGV road user charging cannot discriminate between UK-registered vehicles and vehicles registered elsewhere in the EU. It will therefore apply to both UK and foreign-registered HGVs. It must also comply with the Eurovignette Directive (Directive 1999/62/EC as amended by 2006/38/EC and 2011/76/EU) which sets out a framework of rules for tolls and charges, including maximum daily rates for the latter.

We propose a simple time-based charge, applying to the use of any road in the United Kingdom, meaning that a five axle HGV of 38 tonnes or more would pay £1,000 a year or £10 a day. The Eurovignette Directive's maximum permitted charge is currently €11 per day, although by the introduction of the charge this is likely to have been uprated by inflation to €12 (about £10 at current exchange rates). The precise level of charges will depend on exchange rate movements and inflation between now and the implementation date later this Parliament. UK hauliers would pay an annual (or six months) charge for each HGV at the same time and in the same transaction as they pay its Vehicle Excise Duty. This would avoid extra administration costs for UK business. Foreign hauliers could pay daily, weekly, monthly or annual charges.

As VED and the charge are paid 12 months in advance, UK hauliers would begin to pay the user charge as they renewed an HGV's VED from eleven months before the introduction of charging for foreign vehicles.

The Government will also come forward with measures to offset the additional user charges for UK hauliers, through reductions in taxes, duties or charges they currently face, or through appropriate spending measures. The Chancellor has discretion over tax and spending measures, but the most likely balancing measure in practice will be a reduction in VED towards minimum EU levels.

The overall cost burden will not increase for the vast majority of UK-registered vehicles. We believe that, if we reduce VED to levels at or just above the minimum rates set out in the Eurovignette Directive, around 94% of the current UK vehicle fleet would be no worse off, with 98% paying no more than £50 a year extra.

Non-payment of the user charge would be a criminal offence, which could result in a fine imposed by the courts. The user charge would be enforced by DVLA records, ANPR cameras and checks by the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) at the roadside. VOSA would also be able to issue fixed penalties on the spot to non-compliant drivers (and take financial deposits from drivers based outside the UK).

We are consulting on whether the scheme as a whole should be implemented, as well as on the details of the proposed charging bands, how the scheme will be administered, payment methods, enforcement and support for UK hauliers.

The consultation will run until 18 April 2012. The consultation document and associated tax impact assessment are available in the Library of the House, or on the DfT website at [www.dft.gov.uk](http://www.dft.gov.uk).

The previous Government had Ministerial cars for most Ministers, costing £6.8 million in 09/10. We are now spending just £3.8 million or 55% percent of that, and the number of Ministers requiring cars has reduced by around half.

Today, I am announcing our plans for the coming year in which we expect to deliver further operating cost savings of around one-third. This is part of our ongoing commitment to driving efficiency and improving value for money and transparency for tax payers. It will also allow us to start to reduce the overhead costs associated with the service.

To reflect the government's approach to providing vehicles for Ministers' official travel while maintaining adequate levels of security, I am taking this opportunity to identify a better taxpayer value service, reduce the vehicle fleet and maximise driver and vehicle utilisation. This approach will enable us to re-shape the agency and its estate to deliver a leaner and substantially smaller organisation.

We are working closely with Departments to deliver the main elements of this efficiency and reform programme which are:

  * the phased closure of the Government mail despatch service by the end of the year. I expect current users to make alternative, cost effective arrangements with their existing service providers or to utilise existing government frameworks to secure new services from the private sector;
  * a 50% reduction in the GCDA fleet with a new approach that gives greater control over management of the resource to Departments;
  * a review of estate options;
  * a review of the GCDA's agency status and whether, in the light of the much smaller scale of the operation, that continues to offer the best value for money.

The GCDA is working with Departments to help manage the transition to new arrangements. Subject to those discussions, I expect the changes to the car service to be fully operational by April this year and the transition to new mail arrangements to be completed by the end of the year.

However, we must balance this responsibility against the efficiencies demanded of all public sector organisations and our continued drive to minimise cost.

In my written ministerial statement of 26 July 2010 [Official Report, Columns 75-76WS], I stated my desire to provide the shipping industry with long-term stability in the level of light dues paid for marine aids to navigation. In December 2010, I made a commitment not to increase light dues for at least three years; the industry welcomed it, and I remain committed to it [Official Report, Column 19WS].

Over the last year, I have continued to work with the General Lighthouse Authorities to identify where it is prudent and appropriate to rationalise services, enlisting the expertise of the Authorities' Joint Strategic Board to examine the question of pension liabilities and ever-closer working between the General Lighthouse Authorities themselves. We have identified and exploited considerable opportunities for greater efficiency, the most notable relating to aids to navigation monitoring centralisation, buoy yard reorganisation and staffing reductions. These have succeeded in lowering running costs substantially, against a targeted five year reduction of 17% the General Lighthouse Authorities now expect to achieve 19%.

Furthermore, the Department for Transport tendered and replaced part of the General Lighthouse Fund investment portfolio to facilitate its use for a General Lighthouse Authorities staff pension reserve; the new portfolio reduces investment risk and facilitates stability.

These initiatives and efficiencies have enabled me to freeze light dues this year. Since I became Shipping Minister, there has been a real terms light dues reduction of around 10%.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/penning-20120521a,131,"**The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Mike Penning)**: Today I am announcing the Government's plan to exempt all vehicles of historic interest (vehicles manufactured prior to 1 January 1960) in Great Britain (GB) from statutory MOT test, as allowed under Article 4(2) of the EU Directive 2009/40/EC. I am also publishing the outcome of the consultation (with Government response) on our proposal to exempt historic vehicles from the MOT test which closed on 26 January 2012.

The EU Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council, Chapter II, Exceptions, Article 4 states: ""Member States may, after consulting the Commission, exclude from the scope of this Directive, or subject to special provisions, certain vehicles operated or used in exceptional conditions and vehicles which are never, or hardly ever, used on public highways, including vehicles of historic interest which were manufactured before 1 January 1960 or which are temporarily withdrawn from circulation. Member States may, after consulting the Commission, set their own testing standards for vehicles considered to be of historic interest.""

Whilst the pre-1960 manufactured vehicles made up 0.6% of the 35.2m licensed vehicles in GB they were involved in just 0.03% of road casualties and accidents. Two-thirds of them are driven under 500 miles a year and their initial MOT test failure rate (10%) is only a third of that of post -1960 manufactured vehicles.

Following consultation, the Government has concluded that we should proceed with exempting all pre-1960 manufactured vehicles from the MOT test. The Government believes that the exemption will reduce regulatory burden on owners of historic vehicles, meet its Reducing Regulation agenda and the desire to remove unnecessary burdens. It will also bring the age of vehicles requiring the statutory MOT test in line with The Goods Vehicles (Plating and Testing) Regulations 1988, which already exempts unladen pre-1960 manufactured Heavy Goods Vehicles from the roadworthiness test. Owners of pre-1960 manufactured vehicles will still retain the option to do voluntary MOT test on their vehicles.

The outcome of [consultation with Government response can be found on the Department's website](/consultations/dft-2011-27/).

An amendment will be made to regulation 6 of The Motor Vehicles (Tests) Regulations 1981 to enable the MOT exemption. It is my intention that the changes come into force by 18 November 2012.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/penning-20120522a,132,"## Revising the Charging Regime at the Dartford-Thurrock River Crossing

**The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Mike Penning)**: On the 30th June 2011, the Department for Transport launched a consultation on proposals to revise the road user charging regime at the Dartford-Thurrock River Crossing. The consultation closed on the 23rd September.

The Government had to make hard choices at the time of the 2010 Spending Review, and accepted the need to increase revenues from the Crossing to enable the continuing prioritisation of planned improvements.

The Department's proposal was that cash charge for cars would increase from £1.50 to £2.00 from late 2011, and then to £2.50 in spring 2012, and that prices for other vehicles would also increase at broadly proportionate rates. These increases were part of a strategy to both manage demand at the Crossing and to continue to prioritise short, medium and long term improvements at the Crossing. 

On 24th November 2011, I informed the House that in recognition of the number of representations made, and to allow the Department time to carefully consider the responses further, there would be no increase in either 2011 or spring 2012 as set out in the consultation. 

The Government remains committed to tackling the current and forecast traffic congestion at the Crossing in recognition of its strategic importance, its role in facilitating the movements of goods and people and its contribution to national and local economies. 

The Department received over 1300 responses to its proposals for revising the charging regime at the Crossing. Following careful consideration of all the points made during that consultation I am today announcing the Department's conclusions and the actions it intends taking. 

The Department has decided to keep the road user charging regime at the Crossing as part of its strategy to manage demand for its use, and also to allow the Department to delivery its strategy for future improvements. This includes the medium term measure of implementing free-flow charging technology at the Crossing in Autumn 2014. To achieve this, consultation on the necessary secondary legislation will begin in Autumn this year, followed by awarding the contract for customer charging and enforcement management services in Autumn 2013.

In terms of the charges, the Department intends to increase these in two successive steps, as originally proposed, but to introduce the first increase in October 2012 (after the Olympic period), and the second at the same time as implementation of new, free-flow charging technology at the Crossing, currently scheduled for October 2014.

In terms of the levels of increase, the Department intends to increase the level of the cash charge for cars by 50 pence in October 2012, and again by a further 50 pence in October 2014. The cash charges for other vehicle classes will rise by broadly proportional amounts. 

Discounts offered to regular users of the Crossing who pay in advance through the electronic Dart-Tag system will remain, with the costs of the discounted crossing charge increasing at the same rate and at the same time as the increases for cash payments. 

Delaying the increases until after September responds to views expressed in the consultation about the proposed timing of increases, particularly in relation to the Olympic and Paralympic Games, and about adverse impacts on the national and local economies. 

As promised, the Department will maintain the levels of discounts to those eligible through the Local Residents' Discount Scheme, and there will be no increases in the levels of the crossing charge for them. The Department is committed to ensure that the discount scheme for residents remains effective and easy to use, and I have asked my Department to undertake a full review of the scheme to ensure it provides suitable discounted benefits to local communities who are impacted by the Crossing. 

One of our short term measures to improve the Crossing included the deployment of a charge suspension protocol which was trialled during 2011 by the Highways Agency. The Agency has reviewed the effectiveness of the suspension protocol, taking into consideration the views expressed during the consultation on charges and we will shortly announce the conclusions of that review. 

Subject to the completion of the necessary Parliamentary processes, the Department intends to revise the road user charging regime as set out above. The full response to the consultation can be found on the [Department's website](http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/dft-2011-08/).

**The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Mike Penning):** On 26 January (Official Report, col 26WS) I undertook to report back to the House after taking external advice on an appropriate figure for grant repayment by Liverpool City Council in order to assuage competition concerns sufficiently to withdraw the Department for Transport's objection to turnaround cruise at the City of Liverpool Cruise Terminal.

The grant condition precluding turnaround had originally been set in 2007 in order to avoid unfair competition with other UK ports, which had invested in facilities without grant support. Liverpool City Council had requested that the condition be lifted and it was agreed that a proportion of the grant be repaid.

I have now received this advice and have decided to accept the recommended figure of £8.8M as a lump-sum repayment, or a total of £12.6M if phased over 15 years. In my view this represents a fair outcome that addresses competition concerns while enhancing the benefits to secure which the grants were initially paid. 

Final removal of the grant condition by DCLG will be dependent on securing State Aid clearance from the European Commission, which will now be sought. The Department will assist in that process.

**The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Mike Penning):** I am today announcing the next stage of the reform of the Government Car and Despatch Agency. By the end of this calendar year we intend to have ended GCDA's agency status and to have integrated it into the Department for Transport.

We expect potential savings in administration costs of around £1.3m to be achieved from the ending of agency status once all of the functions have been successfully merged with the Department. We will continue to publish information on expenditure and income to maintain financial transparency.  
I am also announcing the publication of the 2012-13 Business Plan for GCDA.

The Business Plan sets out:

  1. the services the agency will continue to deliver until agency status ends and details of the continuing significant change and reform programme being implemented there;
  2. the resources they require, and
  3. a framework of measures by which their performance will be assessed

The measures allow service users and members of the public to assess how the agency is performing in delivering its key services and reforms and in managing agency finances.

The Business Plan will be available electronically on agency websites and copies will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/penning-20120614a,136,"The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Mike Penning): The Department has today published a [consultation paper](/consultations/dft-2012-25/) on changes to the treatment of penalties for careless driving and other motoring offences. This follows up key commitments from the Government's Strategic Framework for Road Safety published in May 2011.

With careless driving, the current enforcement process is time consuming and inefficient. We are therefore proposing to make careless driving a fixed penalty offence and open to the offer of education training. We believe this will help the police to enforce against this offence more efficiently. It will also provide greater flexibility in dealing with those low level careless driving behaviours that fall below the threshold for a court summons, enabling the greater use of educational training.

We will also be consulting on raising the level of many motoring fixed penalty notices (FPN), including increasing the penalty levels for many (usually endorsable) road traffic £60 FPN offences to £90. We have broadened the scope of the measure and are consulting on other options including, increasing the levels for non-endorsable offences, motor insurance offences, and graduated fixed penalties - all by a similar proportion.

Most of these penalty levels have not been increased since 2000 and are lower than other fixed penalties such as for Disorder. This risks offences being perceived as minor infringements. In addition, increasing penalty levels will encourage the introduction of educational courses for other offences, such as, not wearing a seat belt and the proposed careless driving fixed penalty.

There are no proposals to make any changes to penalty levels for parking restriction FPN offences.

These measures will play an important role in improving road safety for all road users as well as maintaining compliance with motoring laws.

The consultation documents can be found on the Department's website. An electronic copy has been lodged with the House library.

The consultation recognised the need to modernise the way these services are delivered and to respond to the growing demand for more flexible public services.

Today I am announcing that DVLA will press ahead with its proposals to modernise its services. As a result of this decision the DVLA will centralise its enforcement operations by March 2013 and will close its 39 local offices by the end of 2013. While I recognise that a large number of respondents expressed concerns, I believe that many of these concerns can be mitigated and I am confident that this programme will result in modern, effective services delivering savings of £26m each year.

I am also announcing that DVLA will work to ensure that customers in Northern Ireland have access to the full range of vehicle services available to the rest of the UK. This will include on-line taxing of vehicles and introducing additional benefits such as retaining registration marks.

The DVLA will build on its successes in electronic delivery by providing more transactions online. Local businesses will act as intermediaries to offer motorists more convenient access to certain DVLA services through at least 4000 outlets nationwide compared to the current 39 DVLA local offices. The DVLA will ensure that alternative service channels will be available before offices close.

Many of the concerns arising from the consultation related to issues around potential degradation of services and uncertainty over the alternative channels. The DVLA has developed its proposals to address these concerns. Discussions with stakeholders have helped shape these proposals, which will provide the motor trade and individual motorists with a more efficient and effective service through a greater number of convenient, accessible channels.

I am grateful to all those who engaged in the consultation process as their views have helped to develop the proposals in a way that can ensure customer needs are met.

Today, I am publishing a package of documents, including an impact assessment and a formal response to the consultation. These documents provide more detail of the future services and will be available on the DVLA website and in the Library of the House.

I am committed to maintaining or enhancing current service levels for all motorists and the DVLA will continue to work with stakeholders to support their transition onto new channels.

On 27 March 2012 I announced to the House the next steps of that programme. I also informed the House that we would be seeking public and private organisations to work in partnership with the DSA to identify and provide locations from which the practical car test could be delivered.

I am pleased to report that real progress has been made and there are proposals being developed for partnerships with Halfords Group PLC and Mantra Learning Limited. Subject to working agreements being finalised and suitable premises with driving test routes being identified, driving tests should be delivered, in the locations I have already announced, from premises of these organisations in the near future. These will be non exclusive arrangements and DSA may, in future, consider other partnering agreements to provide premises, which meet its criteria. Local agreements with the Fire and Rescue Service, particularly in areas not otherwise covered, are also being explored and there have also been discussions with several universities.

Significantly this use of property will be provided at no cost to DSA. Tests will continue to be conducted by DSA examiners.

DSA will evaluate the success of these arrangements and I will keep the House informed.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/penning-20120717b,140,"**The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Mike Penning):** The Department has today published a consultation paper on the future of the Vehicle Identity Check (VIC) Scheme.

The purpose of the VIC scheme is to deter the crime of vehicle ringing. Typically, this involves the theft of a car often of significant value, which is then given the identity of a similar car (make, model, colour etc) which has been the subject of an insurance write-off. The written-off car is obtained cheaply; its identity (VIN and registration numbers) is then transferred to a higher value stolen car which, now apparently genuine, can be sold at market price.

Since the introduction of the VIC scheme in April 2003, around 717,000 checks have been undertaken and 38 confirmed ""ringers"" detected, at a cost of around £30m to the motorist. About 75% of the checks were undertaken on cars which were 7 years or older, written-off because the cost of even small repairs was greater than the very low market value of the vehicle, often meaning that the cost of the check fell on the less well-off members of society.

Although it is felt that the scheme has become, unintentionally, an unnecessary burden to many honest motorists, the Police feel that it is still the only deterrent to ""ringers"". The scheme also enables vehicle purchasers to be aware that the vehicle they are considering purchasing has previously been a write-off and confirms that the vehicle identity has been checked and therefore provides some protection against purchasing a stolen vehicle.

I intend to consult on whether to retain, re-scope or abolish the scope of the VIC scheme in a move to explore whether fewer vehicles can be checked in the future in order to remove unnecessary burden on law-abiding citizens, without jeopardising prevention of vehicle ringing.

The consultation documents can be found on the Department's website. An electronic copy has been lodged with the House library.

The ATOL Reform Consultation, which took place between 23 June and 15 September 2011, proposed that the new regulations for bringing Flight Plus holidays into ATOL would come into force on 1 January 2012.

Over 80 responses to the consultation were received.  The final details of the ATOL reforms are being decided in light of these responses.  However the overwhelming view from the travel industry has been that implementation on 1 January 2012 would provide insufficient time for businesses to make the necessary preparations to comply with the new requirements.  This is partly due to the time needed to update IT systems and put in place the processes required to enable businesses to identify when a Flight Plus holiday has been formed.

In recognition of these concerns, and to ensure that the new regulations are implemented fully, consistently and in a way that minimises the scope for error and subsequent confusion amongst passengers, I have decided that the new regulations will not now come into force on 1 January.  Instead I intend to implement the reforms in April 2012 in order to give the industry enough time to respond to these new consumer protection requirements.

I expect to make a further announcement before the end of the year about decisions on the other ATOL reform issues in the consultation.

In line with this commitment, I am therefore publishing this statement within 12 months of the previous statement, which was published on July 16th 2009, and set out below the information required to fulfil the commitment to Parliament:

Total funding amounts provided to Crossrail Limited by the Department for Transport and TfL in relation to the construction of Crossrail to the end of the period (22nd July 2008 to 29th May 2010)
£773,769,000

Expenditure incurred (including committed spend not yet paid out) by Crossrail Limited in relation to the construction of Crossrail in the period (31st May 2009 to 29th May 2010) (excluding recoverable VAT on Land and Property purchases)
£963,976,000

Total expenditure incurred (including committed spend not yet paid out) by Crossrail Limited in relation to the construction of Crossrail to the end of the period (22nd July 2008 to 29th May 2010) (excluding recoverable VAT on Land and Property purchases)
£1,160,779,000

The Amounts realised by the disposal of any land or property for the purposes of the construction of Crossrail by the Secretary of State, TfL or Crossrail Limited in the period covered by the statement
Nil

The numbers above are drawn from Crossrail Limited's accounts.  The expenditure incurred amount includes both committed spend that has not yet been paid out and monies already paid out in the relevant periods.

Crossrail will support economic growth for London and the UK, and, as the Coalition Agreement made clear, is supported by Government.   Recent work to update the business case indicates that the project will generate high value for money.  

At this relatively early stage in the project, with several of the main construction contracts currently out to tender, Crossrail Limited continues to forecast a range of possible outturn costs which indicate that the project can be delivered within the available funding.  To ensure that these costs remain affordable and that every pound spent on Crossrail offers value for money, Crossrail Limited are engaged in an ongoing programme of value engineering, risk avoidance and mitigation and indirect cost reduction.  I expect this work to report later in the year.

The Spending Review announcement confirmed Government's joint commitment with the Mayor of London to delivering Crossrail, and secured the funding to deliver the scheme to its original scope.

As I indicated in July, Crossrail Limited has been undertaking a programme of value engineering, risk avoidance and mitigation, alongside indirect cost reduction to ensure that the scheme is delivered in the most efficient way possible. In line with this approach, the Government accepted an engineering-led solution to delivering the central section which has enabled substantial savings of around £1billion to the Crossrail funding package to be identified. While the construction programme for the central section will be lengthened by around a year, this has enabled the Government to confirm that funding is available for the whole project.

We now expect that Crossrail services will commence from 2018. However, the detailed timetable for the phased introduction of Crossrail services requires additional work in a number of areas. For example, further work needs to take place on:

(i) the transfer of services from existing franchises to the future Crossrail operations; and

(ii) the development of detailed plans on the commissioning of services.

It should be noted that Crossrail services were always planned to be phased into operation over some months and it remains a priority for the Government to ensure services are commissioned in the most efficient possible way.

In addition, I wish to inform the House that Crossrail Limited has issued its notice of intention to award the tunnelling contracts for the central section tunnels. These contracts mark a further milestone in Crossrail's progress towards the start of tunnelling in late 2011.

Crossrail Limited continues to work to achieve further savings in advance of the final review point for the project in Spring next year. I expect to make a further update on progress then.

The first sets out the [Government's current thinking on franchising](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110504011839/http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/closed/2010-28/), taking account of the results of the July 2010 consultation, Reforming Rail Franchising. That consultation proposed a variety of policy changes. It made clear our determination to deliver a railway which takes greater account of passenger needs; provides value for taxpayer investment; and delivers the right incentives for operators.

Since the close of the Reforming Rail Franchising consultation in October 2010, the Department has carefully considered the full range of responses, and has discussed the ideas in more detail with industry representatives.

We are now publishing the results of that analysis. Key principles emerging from that work include:

(i) the specifics of each franchise will be decided on a case by case basis, with bidders having a greater role in helping Government define the specification;

(ii) we will set demanding outcomes for operators to deliver but we will give them more flexibility to decide how best to achieve those outcomes, giving greater space to operators to plan and run their services in a more commercial manner;

(iii) longer franchises should expand the opportunity for operators to invest in improvements as well as enabling them to strengthen their working relationships with Network Rail and other key stakeholders.

We also believe that it is vital that the cost of running the railways comes down.

The second publication is a public consultation for the new [InterCity West Coast (ICWC) franchise](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110504011309/http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/closed/2011-01/). A notice was placed in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU) last week at which time a formal accreditation process for bidders also started.

Our overall aim for the new franchise is to take as a starting point the much enhanced operations of recent years and improve these still further, while delivering value for money and meeting affordability requirements.

The ICWC franchise will build on the new timetable that was introduced in December 2008 and made possible by the £9 billion of public funds invested in infrastructure enhancement on the West Coast Main Line. This upgrade has shortened journey times and enabled more trains to be run. It has also delivered a more regular service timetable to Birmingham and Manchester.

Bidders for the franchise will be required to make proposals for the most advantageous deployment of the four additional 11-car Pendolino trains that will be available to them. These new trains will enable the new franchise operator to offer more capacity, more frequent trains and shorter journey times to various locations.

The new operator will need to consider how best to improve the performance and reliability of long distance services and the quality of service received by passengers across the franchise. They will be expected to put forward ideas for improving the passenger experience on board trains, providing better service information for passengers, and investing in station facilities.

The new ICWC franchise will begin operation on Sunday 1 April 2012. The franchise is proposed to last for a term of at least 14 years, aligned to the possible introduction of services on High Speed 2. Provisions will be included in the contract to allow for an earlier termination in the event of persistent under-performance by the operator.

The consultation document highlights the key requirements that the Department is considering including within the Invitation to Tender (ITT), for example, proposals to provide operators more flexibility and encourage investment. Responses to the consultation will inform the development of the ITT which we expect to publish in summer 2011, with the franchise awarded in late 2011.

Over the coming weeks the Department will carry out extensive discussions with local stakeholders, via a series of meetings.

The consultation will run until the 21 April 2011. Copies of the consultation document have been placed in the House Library and are available on the Department for Transport website.

A notice was placed in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU) last week in relation to the Greater Anglia franchise and a formal accreditation process for bidders has begun. This will be a short-term contract lasting from February 2012 to at least the summer of 2013.

Letting this contract will enable us to include appropriate recommendations from the rail value for money study being led by Sir Roy McNulty in a new  long term franchise starting in 2013.

We will not be conducting a public consultation on this contract as the services that are being offered will be largely the same as those in operation today. However, there will be a full public consultation on the long term franchise before it is let.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/villiers-20110203,145,"**The Minister of State for Transport (Theresa Villiers):** I am today announcing the Government's 'in principle' decision to reform the Air Travel Organiser's Licensing (ATOL) scheme to improve clarity for consumers about its coverage and also to put the scheme's finances back on a sustainable basis.  There will be a full consultation on the details of the proposed reforms.

The ATOL scheme, operated by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), was introduced in the 1970s to provide financial protection for the purchase of package holidays in the event of travel company insolvency.  Affected passengers are entitled to a full refund if they are yet to travel, or repatriation after completing their holiday if they have already reached their destination. 

However, as a result of new ways of selling holidays and a recent Court ruling, the scheme no longer completely fulfils its intended purpose:  the proportion of holidays with ATOL protection has fallen, and it can be difficult for consumers and the travel industry to know which holidays are protected and which are not.  The proposed reforms will make it easier for everyone to understand which holidays are covered, and will restore protection to what looks like a package holiday but now falls outside the legal definition.

The Air Travel Trust Fund (the Fund) provides the money for refunds and repatriation costs when a travel company becomes insolvent.  For historic reasons the Fund had no income for a number of years.  As a result of this legacy, combined with travel company failures in 2008 and 2010, the Fund's deficit has increased significantly.  Until it is back in surplus, it can only meet its obligations because of a Government guarantee, currently £42m, in support of commercial borrowing facilities.  Reform is needed to secure the sustainability of the Fund so it can continue to provide financial protection for consumers, while reducing and eventually eliminating the exposure to taxpayers.  It is envisaged that the ATOL Protection Contribution (APC) paid into the Fund will remain at £2.50 per holiday sale until the Fund is restored to health.

The last Government consulted on reforming the ATOL scheme in December 2009, and the Coalition has continued work on developing these important reforms.  In outline the proposed reforms would:

  * create a new category of 'flight plus' holiday in ATOL.  This would cover holidays including a flight where the various elements were purchased within a specified short time period, and so look similar to package holidays, but are not packages as currently legally defined in the UK.  New secondary legislation would be required to do this.
  * ensure that where businesses sell holidays that look like packages, but where the travel agent has arranged matters so they are acting as an 'agent for the customer' and so remain outside of ATOL, consumers are made fully aware of this, so that they can make an informed decision about their purchase.  We are looking at using the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 to enforce this measure.
  * replace the current arrangements with clearer, standardised information for consumers that their holiday or flight is ATOL protected.  The CAA has already begun discussions with the industry about a recognised document, the ATOL Certificate, that would be both proportionate and fit for purpose. This can be done by CAA using its existing powers.

A consultation on the details of the proposals, including draft secondary legislation, is planned for the spring, with the aim of implementation by late 2011 or early 2012.

I believe there may also be a case for new primary legislation to address other issues in the ATOL scheme and will be considering that further in the course of this year.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/villiers-20110228,146,"**The Minister of State for Transport (Theresa Villiers):** Local authorities and Integrated Transport Authorities from time to time wish to develop proposals for new or enhanced rail services where, in their view, they offer the best way of meeting the transport needs of their area.  They have the necessary powers to secure the provision of such services but they are sometimes inhibited by the risk that significant revenue funding may need to be committed over the long term.  I am keen to encourage local bodies to identify the best solutions for identified local needs and therefore wish to ensure that they are not deterred from considering an improved rail service where it clearly offers value for money.

The Government's priority remains one of reducing the budget deficit and, therefore, careful consideration has to be given to any proposal which might increase the cost of the railway, either in the short or long term. However, we recognise the arguments put forward by promoters that regional and local rail services need to adapt to population, housing and economic growth in localities. Therefore, it is only right that, once they have demonstrated value for money after a trial period, new or improved services promoted by local authorities are treated in a similar way to the more established services which are currently funded as part of the national network.

I would therefore like to announce to the House that the Government still intends to fund the provision of new or enhanced services promoted by authorities which have rail industry support, but in view of the tough financial decisions made as part of the Spending Review, no such funding will be provided prior to April 2015 (the start of the next Spending Review period).

It is important that the promoter demonstrates that a rail scheme is the best way to address regional and local transport issues; hence promoters would still be expected to fund a new or enhanced service for the first three years to demonstrate its commitment to the service and show that it delivers value for money in the light of actual experience.

Schemes which the Department would consider funding in this way would be subject to a number of conditions, details of which have been deposited in the library of the House and will be made available on the Department for Transport's web site.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/villiers-20110307,147,"**The Minister of State for Transport (Theresa Villiers)**: As part of the commitment to deliver a safe and secure Olympic and Paralympic Games, the Government is today announcing its plans for temporary airspace control measures that will apply over London and the South East during the Games period.

The measures comprise an inner prohibited airspace zone and an outer restricted zone, approximately 60 nautical miles across, centred on the Olympic Park. 

Only certain categories of aircraft - those operating commercial services and subject to full security procedures - will normally be permitted to operate within the Prohibited Zone. Certain aircraft involved in, for example, Police, Medevac and Olympic Broadcast operations will be exempted. Other operations at airports within this zone may also be considered for exemption subject to strict conditions, which will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Similarly, we are working with Battersea Heliport to agree a basis on which operations there may be allowed to continue. 

All types of aircraft will be permitted to operate in the wider restricted zone provided that they can satisfy certain requirements designed to ensure that all aircraft within the zone can be readily identified and monitored by air traffic control.

It is envisaged that the measures will be in place **from 13 July to 12 September 2012**, to cover the period of both the Olympic and Paralympic Games.

These measures have been designed to help to protect key Games locations from potential airborne threats. It is normal practice to implement airspace restrictions during large-scale events such as major sporting events, and similar measures have been put in place for previous Olympic and Paralympic Games. The measures have been developed to be proportionate and to minimise the impact on the aviation community during the summer of 2012.

It is not expected that any airports will need to close as a result of the measures. There should be no impact on scheduled air services, and limited impact on most other types of operation outside the prohibited zone.

The Government, the Civil Aviation Authority and NATS will now work with airspace users and others to ensure that the planned measures, and their potential impacts, are fully understood and discussed before the regulations to implement them under the Air Navigation Order 2009 are made later this year.

Options for airspace controls over other Olympics venues outside the South East are still being considered and plans for these will be announced later.

Copies of a leaflet entitled ""London 2012 Airspace,"" aimed at the general aviation community, showing the coverage of the zones and setting out in more detail the restrictions that will apply within them, have been placed in the Library.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/villiers-20110510,149,"**Minister of State for Transport (Theresa Villiers):** Cranfield University are today publishing their research into aircraft cabin air sampling on commercial aircraft in scheduled operation. A link to the report is being provided on the Department for Transport website.

The consideration of this matter by the Committee on Toxicity (COT) in 2007 provided an important opportunity to examine this issue in depth. Further scrutiny was provided by the investigation carried out by the House of Lords Science and Technology Committee.

The Department commissioned this independent research in 2008 (once tests had been completed to find suitable scientific equipment for the task) as a result of a recommendation by the COT - the first time such a study had been carried out by any country in the world.

The main conclusion of Cranfield's research was that there was no evidence of pollutants occurring in cabin air at levels exceeding available health and safety standards and guidelines. Levels observed in the flights that formed part of the study were comparable to those typically experienced in domestic settings.

The study monitored a total of 100 flights in five different aircraft types: Boeing 757, Airbus 319, 320 and 321 and the BAe 146. A series of air samples were taken at defined points on all flights, with additional samples taken during any 'fume events' if any occurred. All flight crew, cabin crew and researchers were requested to complete a post-flight questionnaire, including questions about any fumes or smells that occurred during the flight.

The study's objective was to analyse cabin air for volatile organic compounds, semi-volatile organic compounds, particles and carbon monoxide in normal operations during all phases of flight (e.g. climb, cruise, descent); and to detect and characterise any anomalous elevations of these elements during any 'fume events' where unusual smells or similar occurrences were reported.

The European standard 'Aircraft internal air quality standards, criteria and determination methods' sets safety, health and comfort limits for a number of substances, including two that were measured in the study - carbon monoxide and toluene. The study's results indicate that concentrations of both carbon monoxide and toluene remained within these limits. In the absence of specific cabin air standards for the other pollutants measured in the research, the study referred to other standards and guidelines established, for example, for domestic (home) or occupational environments. Again, none of these standards or guidelines was exceeded.

I am grateful to Cranfield University for their rigorous and painstaking work. I am also grateful to the participating airlines which made their flight staff and management time and their aircraft available to the project. Without this invaluable practical help, the research would not have been possible.

The Department will always take the health of persons on board aircraft very seriously and I hope the publication of this thorough and independent analysis by Cranfield University will provide reassurance on this issue. We will continue to keep in close touch on all aviation health matters with the UK's aviation regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority.

The Department will now take forward the one remaining cabin air study outstanding - the swab test research being conducted by the Institute of Occupational Medicine in Edinburgh.

When that has been finished all the completed research projects will be submitted to the Committee on Toxicity for their consideration so that the public can be assured that this matter has been thoroughly investigated.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/villiers-20110616,151,"**The Minister of State for Transport (Theresa Villiers):** The Department for Transport is today announcing the identity of the preferred bidder for the new fleet of trains required for the Thameslink Programme. This represents a significant milestone in the delivery of this crucial rail upgrade project.

The £6 billion Thameslink Programme includes major improvements to central London stations such as Blackfriars, Farringdon and London Bridge and will generate significant benefits for passengers. It will make travelling across London and the south east faster, easier and more reliable and will reduce crowding on some of the busiest sections of London's transport network. It will see the introduction of a new generation of electric commuter trains operating with metro-style frequency at up to 24 trains per hour through the central section during the morning and evening peaks.

This new fleet of trains comprises some 1,200 carriages. By the end of 2018, this will almost double the capacity of Thameslink's core central London section in the peak periods. It is a major part of the Government's commitment to introduce an additional 2,100 carriages on to the rail network by 2019, as announced in November of last year.  The new Thameslink fleet is expected to release existing carriages for use elsewhere on the network, particularly as further routes are electrified, for example in the north west of England and the Thames Valley commuter lines.

The competition to supply trains and maintenance services for the Thameslink programme was designed and launched under the previous administration in 2008, in accordance with EU procurement procedures. In October 2009 the previous government announced that the two remaining short-listed bidders were Siemens Plc with Cross London Trains (XLT) and Bombardier Transportation UK Ltd with VeloCity. Since then, a great deal of work has been undertaken by the Department with both bidders to refine proposals and to secure best and final bids.

Following the completion of the process, I can announce today that the preferred bidder for the supply of the new Thameslink trains will be Siemens Plc with Cross London Trains (XLT) - a special purpose company comprising of Siemens Project Ventures GmbH, Innisfree Ltd and 3i Infrastructure Plc.

The Siemens-led venture will deliver the first new train on to the network by the start of 2015, with the order complete by the middle of 2017. The new trains will offer a step change in passenger experience, with greater passenger carrying capacity, improved passenger communication and easier access for passengers with specific mobility needs. They will also deliver high levels of reliability with the owner and manufacturer of the trains liable for financial penalties if the trains do not perform.

The choice of Siemens Plc with Cross London Trains (XLT) as preferred bidder represents the best value for money for taxpayers. Siemens is today confirming that this announcement will create up to 2,000 new jobs in their UK operations and across the UK supply chain in train component manufacturing, with a particular focus in the North East of England, and in the construction of the depots and subsequent maintenance of the new fleet of trains.

These jobs are additional to those created by the Thameslink infrastructure works which are currently underway. At the peak of construction activity - during the reconstruction of London Bridge Station from 2013 to 2018 - we expect around 3,000 people to be directly employed on the Thameslink infrastructure works as a whole, with as many again employed in related jobs in the wider community.  Taking account of other investments in rail announced by this Government, including Crossrail and the Inter City Express Programme, the total peak construction employment rises to around 17,000 people.

In order to maintain momentum on the Thameslink Programme, it is important that discussions with Siemens Plc and Cross London Trains move forward quickly to enable financial close to occur as soon as practicable. That is, of course, subject to the Government being satisfied that the proposal continues to offer value for money as the commercial discussions are concluded.

The alternative bidder, Bombardier Transportation UK Ltd with VeloCity - a special purpose company comprising Bombardier Transportation (Holdings) UK Ltd, RREEF Ltd, Serco Holdings Ltd, Amber Infrastructure Group Ltd and SMBC Leasing (UK) Ltd - also presented an attractive proposal and it is our intention to retain them as the reserve bidder.  
This announcement of the preferred bidder for these new trains marks further progress in the delivery of the Thameslink Programme, and reinforces the Government's commitment to upgrading the capacity, quality and reliability of our transport infrastructure and ensuring high value for money for the taxpayer in delivering major rail projects.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/villiers-20110623,152,"**The Minister of State, Department for Transport (Mrs Theresa Villiers)**: I am pleased to announce that a consultation on reforming the air travel organisers' licensing (ATOL) scheme is being published today.

Since its inception some 40 years ago, the ATOL scheme has successfully protected many millions of consumers on flight-inclusive package holidays  against the insolvency of their travel company.  However, the travel trade and holiday market has seen significant change and diversification in recent years. There are now many holidays available which look like packages but do not fall under the legal definition and so are not protected under the ATOL scheme.

There is a strong case for reforming the scheme to better reflect today's holiday market so that consumers can be clear when their holiday is protected, allowing them to understand and use their legal rights. In addition, the scheme has operated with a deficit for some years and is supported by taxpayers through a Government guarantee. The reforms should put the ATOL scheme on the path to financial self-sustainability, with a view to ending the need for taxpayer support.

The consultation document sets out the details of the 'in principle' decisions I announced on 3 February (_Official Report_ 3 Feb 2011: Column 55WS). These were:

  * extending the ATOL scheme to Flight-Plus holidays comprising a flight and other component bought within two successive days;
  * that everyone booking a ATOL protected package holiday or Flight-Plus will get a recognisable 'ATOL certificate' confirming their rights under the scheme for refunds and repatriation should their travel company fail;
  * helping ensure that 'agent for the consumer' businesses arranging holidays are fully aware of their legal responsibilities to consumers.

It contains the draft secondary legislation needed to implement the first two measures.

This is an important first step towards reforming the ATOL scheme. These reforms will address a major area of uncertainty for consumers when buying holidays from tour operators and travel agents.  The additional ATOL Protection Contributions at £2.50 per booking should help the scheme become financially self-sustaining within three years.

Importantly, the reforms pave the way for further potential change to the ATOL scheme in the medium to longer term.  Once the scheme's deficit has been paid off and the guarantee withdrawn, there is an opportunity to consider how funding repatriations and refunds might best be arranged in today's market.  The consultation seeks initial views on this, to inform more detailed work to be undertaken by the Civil Aviation Authority later in the year and into 2012.

The consultation also asks stakeholders about bringing holiday sales by airlines and those arranged on an 'agent for the consumer' basis into the scheme.  These would require new primary legislation.  The Bill to reform airport economic regulation could provide a vehicle to make the necessary changes if Government decides to go ahead with these further reforms.  Decisions on reforms needing new primary legislation are planned for the autumn and may also need to take account work underway by the European Commission on the future of the Package Travel Directive.

The consultation closes on 15 September 2011. My aim is to announce decisions in the autumn on the way forward on the reforms dependent on new secondary legislation.  Subject to consultation responses, the intention is for the reforms to come into effect on 1 January 2012, so consumers have the benefit of the additional protection from their summer 2012 holidays.

This Order, made by the Olympic Delivery Authority following a three month public consultation, makes a number of changes to the roads originally designated in a June 2009 Order as forming the Olympic Route Network (ORN).  The ORN is a set of roads that will be used during the 2012 London Olympic and Paralympic Games to provide safe and reliable transport for athletes, officials, the media and marketing partners (together the 'Games Family') between sporting and non-sporting venues.

The amendments set out in the Order comprise both additions to and removals from the designated roads, and add a net 1.3% to the length of the ORN. The changes reflect the work carried out by the ODA and its delivery partners since the initial designation on the plans for implementing the ORN and for the Games more widely - particularly on the movement of vehicles carrying members of the Games Family on the approaches to the competition venues.  The changes aim to secure more effectively safe and reliable transport for the Games Family and reduce the impacts of ORN operations on normal business.  They reflect ODA's careful consideration of the 43 responses received to the consultation exercise on proposed changes carried out last year.

Staging the Games presents a significant challenge to our transport systems.  The ORN remains a key part of our plans to ensure successful transport at the Games, for those participating, for spectators, and for those going about their normal business.  We remain committed to implementing temporary, tailored and proportionate measures on the ORN that meet the Games' needs while minimising the impacts on others.  Extensive local engagement by the ODA and Transport for London on the detailed plans for implementing the ORN, taking account of the changes set out in this Order, is now underway.

A full report on the ODA's consultation exercise and maps showing the revised ORN will be available on the ODA's website at [www.london2012.com/orn](http://www.london2012.com/orn).

As part of the Comprehensive Spending Review in October 2010, the Coalition Government confirmed their commitment to the full Crossrail scheme. A re-phased programme of delivery means that Crossrail services will commence from 2018. We expect Crossrail to cost no more than £14.5bn. Forecasts continue to suggest that Crossrail will be delivered within its existing funding.

Crossrail has made significant progress since the last annual update to Parliament. Crossrail Limited has now let all of its key tunnelling contracts and enabling works are continuing at a number of sites across central London. Construction is well advanced at Canary Wharf Crossrail Station, and tunnel boring machines are expected to be launched in spring 2012. In April 2011, Crossrail passed through the final Project Review Point, at which point the Department and TfL delegated full contractual authority to Crossrail Limited to deliver the scheme. The new Chief Executive of Crossrail Limited, Andrew Wolstenholme, was appointed in May 2011.

During the passage of the Crossrail Act through Parliament, a commitment was given that a statement would be published at least every 12 months until the completion of the construction of Crossrail, setting out information about the project's funding and finances.

In line with this commitment, this statement comes within 12 months of my last one which was published on 15th July 2010. The relevant information is as follows:

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/villiers-20110714,155,"**The Minister of State for Transport (Theresa Villiers):** On 15 June 2010, the Government announced the establishment of the South East Airports Taskforce with representatives from the aviation industry to explore the scope for measures to help make the most of existing airport infrastructure and improve conditions for all users. I chaired the Taskforce. Its focus was on action at our three biggest airports - Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted. Today I am announcing the publication of the Taskforce's Final Report.

The Taskforce was given a challenging remit. It had 12 months to identify operational improvements that could enhance the performance of these airports and bring benefits to passengers. The report is the culmination of a year long programme of work across seven areas, including punctuality, security and border controls. It sets out the issues considered by the Taskforce and its conclusions.

I would draw particular attention to the chapter on improving punctuality, tackling delay and strengthening resilience. The focus of this chapter is on Heathrow, which is the UK's biggest, busiest and most capacity constrained airport.  The main recommendation is that the scope for establishing a set of operational freedoms at Heathrow should be explored. These would enable the greater use of tactical measures in defined and limited circumstances to prevent or mitigate disruption and to facilitate recovery. These measures are consistent with our commitment to runway alternation at the airport and there would be no increase in the number of flights at the airport which will remain capped at current levels.

Tactical measures, such as operating twin arrivals streams for limited periods to tackle inbound delays, are already used at Heathrow; implementation of these proposals would mean greater use of such measures on days when the airport faced particular disruption. The Taskforce has concluded that such an approach would deliver benefits, particularly in improving reliability, but would also mean some limited redistribution of noise when measures were applied.

The work carried out so far indicates that the proposals could result in net environmental benefits, for example through reducing stacking and cutting the number of unscheduled flights during the night period. However, on the limited occasions where these freedoms would operate, some communities would be likely to experience aircraft noise during current respite periods; hence the need for safeguards to ensure they are deployed only to anticipate, prevent and mitigate disruption and to facilitate recovery.

Before any commitment is made to implementing such operational freedoms, better evidence is needed of the potential benefits and impacts.  I am therefore announcing a phased trial of operational freedoms at Heathrow. The trial will provide firm evidence on the benefits and impacts of these measures and will provide a basis for consultation with local communities before a decision is taken on whether the proposed additional operational freedoms should be adopted on a permanent basis and what safeguards should apply in relation to their use.

The trial will be in two phases to enable evidence to be gathered for both winter and summer operations. Following engagement with local communities, the first phase will run from November 2011 to February 2012, followed by a four month period of initial assessment and further engagement on how the regime might be refined to mitigate any impacts of particular concern and deliver additional benefits.

The second phase will run from July 2012 to September 2012, providing the added benefit of enabling greater resilience during the London Olympic and Paralympic Games when the UK's airports will be under more pressure than normal.  The trial will be undertaken by BAA, the airport operator, under the supervision of the Civil Aviation Authority, the independent aviation regulator.

BAA will be required to engage fully and transparently with relevant local authorities, communities and other stakeholders throughout the process, particularly on the monitoring of noise impacts. Once assessed, the results of the trial will form the basis for a consultation with local communities which would in due course inform the Government in deciding whether an operational freedoms regime should be adopted at Heathrow.

I am grateful to the Taskforce members not only for their constructive input into the Taskforce over the past few months, but also for their continuing commitment to delivering real improvements for passengers.  I intend to reconvene the Taskforce in a year's time to review the progress made.

The UK was represented by officials. The theme was: ""Mobilizing private financing for transport infrastructure"". The debate was based on a number of questions put by the Presidency, which were principally about the use of Public-Private Partnerships.

The key points conveyed by the UK are as follows:

  * For the UK, the primary factor determining PPP use is whether it offers the best value for money compared to alternative delivery options. The features that impact on the value for money decision include: public sector access to private sector capital and expertise and the transfer of financial risk from the public to the private sector.  
A key feature of the UK public sector comparator process is that it is not entirely based on a quantitative calculation of the respective delivery outcomes. The calculation is supported by a qualitative assessment of the respective delivery routes in terms of their viability, desirability and achievability.
  * The UK set out several examples of the use of PPP in the transport sector, which included contracts for street lighting, highway maintenance and London Underground. We reported that that the experience of PPP in this sector has been mixed. While PPP programmes have helped secure significant infrastructure investment and, in a number of cases, achieved an improved record on the delivery of projects to time and budget, this has only been achieved by repeated interventions.
  * Work has recently been undertaken to achieve a stronger focus on flexibility. Project reviews are being undertaken to improve the delivery of cost reductions and value for money. New PPP projects are subject to tougher approval and assurance processes. The UK no longer uses the PPP format to source projects for which there is an insufficient capital requirement or continuing lifecycle maintenance/service obligation, or for lower value projects.
  * The UK emphasised that while PPP remains a useful procurement option, it is not suitable for every project and should only be selected when it can demonstrate that it provides a better value for money outcome than conventional procurement processes.
  * The UK noted that a fundamental feature of PPP structures is that they provide for availability payments over the life of a long-term service contract. However, EU regulations only provide for availability payments that are linked to development and construction pre-payments. If operational availability payments are not permitted, this could distort the decision-making process on the type of PPP structure that is adopted and unnecessarily constrain the options available to Member States.

There was a Policy Debate on a draft Regulation amending Regulation 3821/85 on **recording equipment in road transport** and amending regulation 561/2006. The UK reiterated our support for measures that reduce burdens on business and expressed doubts that the costs and benefits of the Commission's proposal had been fully assessed. The Presidency noted that discussions were at an early stage and that consideration would continue at official level.

The mandate for enlarging the geographical scope of the existing **Interbus Agreement** was not discussed at the Council.

The Council agreed two negotiating mandates in the area of **aviation external relations**:

  * The first was to negotiate a High Level Agreement with the European Organisation for Safety of Air Navigation (**EUROCONTROL**).
  * The second was to open negotiations on a comprehensive air transport agreement with **Azerbaijan**.

The Council adopted Conclusions on the Commission Communication on ""The **EU and its neighbouring regions**: A renewed approach to transport cooperation"". A number of member states intervened in support. The Conclusions have taken on board UK's key concerns and are set broadly to maximise the opportunities for trade liberalisation, economic integration and regulatory convergence.

A lunchtime discussion on **trans-European transport network** was held. The UK stressed the need for realism on the TENs budget in the current economic climate and emphasised that decisions on which projects should be developed and invested in on national networks should remain with the member states concerned. Legislative proposals for all trans-European networks (transport, energy and digital communication) are expected to be published on 19 October.

Among AOB items, discussions were held on the **Emissions Trading System (ETS) for Aviation**. The Presidency noted that the ECJ had published an Advocate General's opinion which concluded that the Aviation ETS Directive was compatible with EU law. The Commission provided oral information noting that the situation was getting highly political and would require a united EU approach to face off third countries' opposition. The UK intervened to reiterate its commitment to the inclusion of aviation in the EU ETS and its support of the Advocate General's opinion.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/villiers-20111020,159,"**The Minister of State for Transport (Theresa Villiers)**: I can today announce that Abellio Greater Anglia Limited has been awarded the Greater Anglia (Short) franchise.

The new franchise will begin operation on Sunday 5 February 2012. It will operate for 29 months (32 rail industry periods).

Bids were received from Abellio Greater Anglia Limited (NV Nederlandse Spoorwegen), Eastern Railway Limited (Go-Ahead Group PLC), and Stagecoach Anglia Trains Limited (Stagecoach Group plc).

Abellio Greater Anglia Limited has been chosen to run trains on the network, which operates across Essex, Suffolk, Norfolk and Cambridgeshire. The franchise will also play a significant role in transport for the London 2012 Games providing crucial services to the Olympic Park area.

The terms of the contract the Government has agreed with the winning bidder will deliver a series of improvements for passengers during the 29 month franchise.

These include providing better station and ticket facilities and measures to improve passenger information. A text messaging service to keep passengers informed if service disruption occurs will be introduced. New information desks will be provided at major stations including London Liverpool Street, Cambridge, Norwich, Ipswich and Stansted Airport.

The new franchise will make it easier for passengers to buy tickets, including:

  * extending Oyster Pay As You Go between London Liverpool Street and all stations to Shenfield, and stations to Hertford East
  * improvements to ticket vending machines, and
  * introducing mobile phone and print-at-home ticketing facilities.

Abellio Greater Anglia Limited has also committed to provide an additional 600 car park spaces (subject to planning approvals), more cycle storage facilities and deliver a number of other measures to improve the service to customers including deep cleaning of stations and trains.

The train company will take over station leases from Network Rail, taking on responsibility for all repairs and renewals at stations. This accords with the Government's overall franchise reform programme which advocates transfer of more responsibility for stations to train operators as the passenger-facing side of the rail industry.

To date, only overall figures for the performance of the franchise as a whole have been published. From the start of the new franchise, Abellio Greater Anglia Limited will start publishing a break down of punctuality figures by route giving passengers more transparency over the performance of the lines they use. The reliability requirements for the new franchise are also more demanding than the previous one.

When the franchise is renewed again in July 2014, the contract is expected to be 15 years in length. This forthcoming franchise will provide the opportunity to seek further improvements for passengers. We also intend to draw on the work of Sir Roy McNulty in setting the terms of the franchise with the aim of reducing costs and improving efficiency.

Over the course of the extension three new 600-seat Pendolino trains will be added to the line. This is in addition to the new Pendolino train which entered service in July of this year. Also, 31 of the existing Pendolino trains will be lengthened from 9 to 11 carriages, increasing the number of standard class seats on each train by almost 50%, from 320 to 470. In all, 106 new carriages are being introduced on the route making 28,000 extra seats available each day, an increase of 25%. This will relieve crowding on some of the busiest parts of the West Coast Main Line which is one the UK economy's most important transport corridors.

Virgin will also be responsible for providing important services enabling people travel by train to the Olympic and Paralympic Games next summer.

**The Minister of State for Transport (Theresa Villiers):** When the CAA is exercising its air navigation functions it is required under the Transport Act 2000 to take account of environmental Guidance given to it by the Secretary of State.  The current Guidance was issued in 2002 by the then Department for Transport, Local Government and Regions.

The CAA has been able to take account of the Guidance to make decisions on over 70 proposals for airspace change over the last nine years.  The Guidance recommends that the CAA keeps abreast of current Government policy including on planning, sustainable development and noise as well as guidance issued by the devolved administrations.

Given the length of time since the Guidance was published, and the recommendations of Sir Joseph Pilling in his July 2008 strategic review of the CAA and the Transport Select Committee in its 2009 report on the Use of Airspace, the Government recognises the need to update the Guidance to reflect current Government policy, including on issues such as noise and climate change.  This will be done next year following development of the _Sustainable Framework for UK Aviation_ and will include a public consultation so that all views can be heard on this important subject.

In the interim the Department for Transport is publishing today a technical addendum to the Guidance.  The addendum updates references and lists relevant policy documents and legislation published since 2002 that the CAA takes into account when considering airspace change proposals.

The Government's intention is that such a step would only be taken following full consultation with stakeholders including an impact assessment.

The Government intends to make a further statement on the full range of proposals for ATOL reform, shortly.

The Department for Transport has today published an Invitation to Tender to mark the commencement of the formal bidding stage of the competition to replace the current operator on the West Coast Main Line. The new franchise will continue through to March 2026, this date being aligned to the introduction of High Speed services along the proposed HS2 route.

  * [InterCity West Coast franchise](/publications/rail-passenger-franchise-intercity-west-coast)

Increasing capacity and tackling overcrowding is our priority. 106 extra 'Pendolino' carriages are being provided for the West Coast. In addition to the 45% increase in capacity delivered in December 2008, 31 existing Pendolinos are being lengthened from 9 to 11 carriages and 4 new trains are being introduced, increasing the number of standard class seats on each train by almost 50%, from 320 to 470.

In all, the 106 new carriages will make 28,000 extra seats available each day, an increase of 25%. We expect that the additional and lengthened trains will be targeted on those routes and times of day with the highest demand.

It was further announced in May that a consultation would take place on a revised Train Service Requirement (TSR). A summary of and response to this consultation has also been published today on the Department for Transport website.

The TSR has been designed to give bidders greater flexibility to respond to passenger demand and run their businesses in a more commercial way within a framework set by the franchise that protects key outcomes for passengers, taxpayers and the economy. The TSR requires the provision of the same number of weekly stops at each station as set out in the current franchise; but will allow the franchisee to vary the capacity provided on individual days of the week in order to cater for the variations in daily demand.

The ITT contains less specification than in previous competitions, with a stronger focus on outcomes, for example on passenger satisfaction, rather than detailed prescriptive inputs. We expect the additional flexibility set out in the ITT to enable bidders to provide both a better service for passengers and an improved financial return for taxpayers.

However we will continue to specify core requirements and to manage overall compliance of key deliverables, such as performance and service quality. The franchise will contain new obligations based around passenger satisfaction with stations, trains and customer services.

The franchise length of up to 15 years including an option to extend by 20 months is intended to encourage the development of long term relationships between the operator and stakeholders giving greater scope to challenge and reduce excessive industry costs. We also expect the certainty provided by a long franchise to encourage investment in assets such as stations, by extending the period over which commercially attractive schemes can pay back. The new franchisee will take over full repairing responsibilities for the 17 stations they manage. We believe that cost savings can be achieved through combining roles currently split between the operator and Network Rail in relation to stations.

A new risk sharing mechanism based on macroeconomic variables has been introduced to remove some of the perverse operator behaviour experienced under the Cap and Collar system, while still providing an appropriate allocation of risk between the taxpayer and the operator.

Cap and Collar led to stronger concentration on revenue generation schemes rather than on cost reduction because support was available in the event of underperformance on revenue. Our new risk sharing mechanism helps create a more balanced approach to revenue and costs when bidders are considering how to develop their business.

A profit share mechanism has been introduced to enable the taxpayer to benefit from a share in profits above an agreed threshold which the franchise has generated, while continuing to provide sufficient incentive for the franchisee to outperform.

The franchise will specify the introduction of ITSO based smart ticketing. The introduction of smart ticketing will provide significant benefits for passengers and the use of the ITSO standard will enable the same card to be used on a range of different public transport services.

The InterCity West Coast ITT takes forward the franchising reforms set out in January 2011. Given the diversity of the rail network, our approach will be adapted to meet the individual requirements of different franchises. Future franchise contracts will not be identical but common themes will underlie all of them, including an emphasis on innovation, passenger satisfaction and greater commercial freedom to respond to the needs of passengers.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/villiers-20120209,165,"**The Minister of State for Transport (Theresa Villiers):** Today I am pleased to announce the Government's decisions on the proposals set out in last Summer's consultation on the reform of the Air Travel Organiser's Licensing (ATOL) scheme which can be introduced through new regulations under existing powers.

ATOL is a longstanding and important scheme, which last year protected 18 million holidaymakers from travel company failure. ATOL is particularly relevant in today's uncertain times, allowing consumers to book with the confidence that if their holiday company fails, their money will be protected or they will be able to return home as planned if they are already away, without any extra cost.

It is essential that the scheme should apply in an effective way in the modern holiday market; so that consumers are clear about their rights and how to use them, and holiday companies know which of their products must be protected.

In addition the Air Travel Trust Fund, which provides for refunds and repatriations under the scheme, is operating at a deficit and is supported by a Government guarantee. The Fund needs to return to a financially self-sustaining basis as soon as possible so that taxpayers' money is no longer exposed to risk.

Between 23 June and 15 September 2011 the Government consulted on a set of initial reforms to the ATOL scheme with the following objectives:

  * Improving clarity for consumers about what holidays are protected.
  * Returning Air Travel Trust Fund finances to a self-sustaining basis, with the deficit repaid and Government guarantee phased out.

The longer to medium term objectives are to:

  * Further improve the clarity of the scheme and develop a more consistent and coherent regulatory framework for businesses.
  * Look at options for how the ATOL scheme is managed and* financed once it is financially self-sustaining, with a view to reducing its cost to the travel trade and consumers.

The ATOL reform consultation received eighty two responses. I am grateful to stakeholders for taking the time to reply. In light of the responses and further analysis, I am confirming today that new ATOL regulations will be made that will:

  * Bring into the ATOL scheme Flight-Plus holidays sold by tour operators and travel agents. These are holidays that look like packages but don't meet the legal definition, and so do not currently require protection under the scheme. Including these holidays will end a significant source of confusion for consumers, and we expect up to an additional 6 million holidays a year will be fully ATOL protected as a result.
  * Ensure that on paying for an ATOL protected Flight-Only, package holiday or Flight-Plus, consumers receive a certificate confirming that their trip is covered by the scheme. To give the travel trade sufficient time to prepare, this requirement will come fully into effect on 1 October 2012. Until then, consumers will receive clear confirmation that their holiday or flight is ATOL protected.

Taking account of consultation responses and further discussion with stakeholders, the new ATOL regulations will include a number of changes to the draft regulations consulted on. These include changes to the definition of a Flight-Plus holiday and a revised approach to the exemption for Flight-Only sales where tickets are provided immediately on payment. Further details on these changes are included in the summary of responses and the Government's decisions published today on the Department's website.

  * [ATOL reform consultation summary of responses](/consultations/dft-2011-17/#responses)

It is intended that the new regulations will be laid in Parliament in March, before coming into effect on 30 April 2012.

In addition to bringing greater clarity to consumers about ATOL protection for holidays and flights, we expect that these reforms should allow the ATOL scheme's financial deficit to be repaid within three years. This will pave the way for possible future changes to improve how the ATOL scheme is funded and managed. The Civil Aviation Authority plans initial discussions with stakeholders on options for this later in the year, building on responses to the question posed in the consultation on this subject.

These regulations complement the clause in the Civil Aviation Bill introduced on 19 January 2012 that would allow the ATOL scheme to cover holidays sold by airlines and those organised on an agent for the consumer basis. Subject to Parliamentary process, the Government's intention is that such a step would only be taken following full consultation with stakeholders including an impact assessment.

The trial is run by BAA, the airport operator, with oversight provided by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), the independent aviation regulator.

These measures are consistent with the Government's commitment to runway alternation at Heathrow. I would also emphasise that the trial will not increase the number of flights at Heathrow which remains capped at current levels.

Phase one of the trial ran from 1 November 2011 until 29 February 2012. An interim report on the first two months of phase one was published by the CAA on 21 February 2012 . [The CAA has today published its final report on phase one](http://www.caa.co.uk/apfg), alongside a report by BAA, assessing the impact on operations at the airport and on communities around Heathrow.

The CAA's report is encouraging about the benefits of the measures trialled so far, but suggests that more detailed data and analysis is required from phase two to draw definite conclusions on these and the impacts on local communities.

The CAA report concluded BAA ran phase one of the trial within the parameters agreed with Government and generally collected and published data for analysing the trial in an appropriate and transparent manner. The CAA noted that the broad spectrum of interested parties, and the technical nature of the measures trialled, made successful engagement with local communities challenging; and they made suggestions for improvement.

The report also accepted BAA's analysis that phase one of the trial recorded:

  * dual arrivals were deployed for 3.2% of westerly arrivals at the airport (1802 out of 56260 arrivals); an average increase of 13 de-alternated flights each day on westerly arrivals, from 21 to 34 per day;
  * dual departures were deployed for 0.07% of westerly departures at the airport (38 out of 55860 departures);
  * operational improvements in relation to arrival punctuality and delay, stacking (under specific circumstances) and taxi times following arrival;
  * A large increase in complaints, although it was not clear whether these were generated by the use of operational freedoms, as a proportion appear to correlate to a prolonged period of easterly operations which was due to weather conditions rather than the trial;
  * generally low awareness of the trial but some support for it from residents surveyed when its objectives were explained; and
  * no detriment to safety.

In my previous statement, I also set out the timetable for phase two of the trial. Following advice from the CAA, I am announcing today that I have agreed to a six month extension of phase two which will now run from July 2012 to March 2013.

The CAA concluded that the relatively short duration of phase one meant that the evidence it provided on the impact of operational freedoms was more limited than anticipated, partially as a result of an unusually high level of easterly operations. The extension until March 2013 will increase the amount of data generated enabling a more robust analysis of the benefits and impacts, allowing a direct comparison between phases one and two. A longer trial will also reduce the risk that external factors (such as easterly winds) significantly limit the amount of usable information. This will ensure that the eventual consultation with local communities on whether a more permanent operational freedoms regime is adopted at the airport is based on a sufficient level of evidence.

Phase two will also mean that Heathrow will benefit from greater resilience during the Olympic and Paralympic Games period when the airport will be under more pressure than usual.

Improving punctuality, tackling delay and strengthening resilience at Heathrow would improve the quality of the UK's international connections and enhance the reputation of our largest international gateway. Phase one has shown that, without prejudging our views on the associated impacts, there is potential to deliver operational benefits without increasing capacity. We therefore have grounds to believe that there is still more that can be done to deliver a better Heathrow, while continuing to protect communities affected by aircraft noise.

I have therefore agreed to the continuation of the trial of tactical use of dual arrivals and departures measures agreed for the first phase. I have also agreed that the following freedoms should be added to phase two:

  * Aircraft scheduled to arrive after 0600 will be permitted to land between 0530 and 0600 provided that the same number of flights scheduled to arrive between 0430 and 0500 are rescheduled to after 0500. This is expected to delay the onset of noise disturbance to local communities in the early morning period and enhance the resilience of the schedule;
  * During ""segregated"" operations departing aircraft may be re-directed (radar vectored) by air traffic control from their normal routes of departure (mostly within pre-determined noise preferential routes). This is expected to improve the reliability of the schedule by increasing the departure rate from a single runway and improve the scope for reducing the number of unscheduled night flights;
  * Subject to approval of the safety case by CAA, it is intended to apply the same principles to enable dual departures later in phase two, but only within the pre-determined noise preferential routes;
  * The cap on the more flexible use of dual arrivals allowed as part of the trial will be raised from 6 to 12 per hour;
  * The proactive tests used briefly in phase one will be continued. The periods during which these tests will be undertaken will be announced on BAA's website during the first month of phase two.

BAA will shortly begin a further period of engagement with local authorities, communities and other stakeholders around the operation of phase two, particularly on the monitoring of noise impacts. Once the trial is complete, the evidence collected will provide the basis for a consultation with local communities. This will consider whether an operational freedoms regime of some form should be adopted on a more permanent basis at Heathrow and if so what safeguards should apply in relation to its use. This consultation will inform the subsequent decision by Ministers.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/villiers-20120710a,169,"**The Minister of State for Transport (Theresa Villiers)**: Crossrail is now moving firmly into its construction phase. A number of significant milestones have been achieved in the last twelve months. The purpose built Tunnelling and Underground Construction Academy was opened in East London last year and welcomed its first students in September 2011. Tunnelling began in May, with the first tunnel boring machine launched at the Royal Oak Portal in west London. Construction contracts for Paddington, Farringdon, Whitechapel, Tottenham Court Road and Liverpool Street stations have been awarded. The Canary Wharf station box structure is now complete. The Invitation to Negotiate for the Crossrail Rolling Stock and Depot contract was launched by Crossrail Limited on 28 February, with the first round of tenders due to be returned during late summer.

To reduce the number of lorry movements, excavated material from Crossrail's western tunnels has started to be transported directly from Royal Oak to Northfleet in Kent by rail. A former freight line from the North Kent Line has been completely reconstructed to enable freight train movements from London. Two-thirds of excavated material generated by tunnel, station and shafts construction will be taken to Northfleet and transferred by ship to create a new 1,500 acre nature reserve at Wallasea Island in Essex.

Network Rail is responsible for delivering improvements on the existing surface sections of the Crossrail route. The Overall Target Price for these works was approved in April 2012 and was within the £2.3bn funding envelope. Network Rail has also begun construction of the expanded Stockley Flyover in west London to enable higher frequency Crossrail trains to operate to Heathrow Airport.

Crossrail services are on schedule to be operational from 2018 with full services operating from late 2019. The Crossrail Board continues to forecast that the costs of constructing Crossrail will be within the agreed funding limits. We expect Crossrail to cost no more than £14.5billion.

During the passage of the Crossrail Bill through Parliament, a commitment was given that a statement would be published at least every 12 months until the completion of the construction of Crossrail, setting out information about the project's funding and finances.

In line with this commitment, this statement comes within 12 months of my last one which was published on 13 July 2011. The relevant information is as follows:

Total funding amounts provided to Crossrail Limited by the Department for Transport and Transport for London ('TfL') in relation to the construction of Crossrail to the end of the period (22 July 2008 to 29 May 2012).
£2,751,624,360

Expenditure incurred (including committed land and property spend not yet paid out) by Crossrail Limited in relation to the construction of Crossrail in the period 30 May 2011 to 29 May 2012 (excluding recoverable VAT on Land and Property purchases).
£1,044,294,000

Total expenditure incurred (including committed land and property spend not yet paid out) by Crossrail Limited in relation to the construction of Crossrail to the end of the period 22 July 2008 to 29 May 2012 (excluding recoverable VAT on Land and Property purchases).
£2,928,548,000

The Amounts realised by the disposal of any land or property for the purposes of the construction of Crossrail by the Secretary of State, TfL or Crossrail Limited in the period covered by the statement.
£nil

The numbers above are drawn from Crossrail Limited's books of account and have been prepared on a consistent basis with the update provided last year. The figure for expenditure incurred includes monies already paid out in relevant periods, including committed land and property expenditure where this has not yet been paid. It does not include future expenditure on construction contracts that have been awarded.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/baker-2012108a,170,"Thank you for inviting me to give the keynote address at this year's National Highways and Transport Network Conference. I am also pleased that the Highways Maintenance Efficiency Programme is helping support this annual conference for the second year.

First let me say that I am very sorry I can't be with you in person, but I am glad that I can be virtually with you at least.

I am always interested in what the National Highways and Transport Network Surveys results reveal about what the public actually think about the various aspect of transport in their local areas. I understand that 75 local authorities subscribed to this year's survey and, given the total number of interviews in each area, this represents a significant insight into public perception.

As the minister with particular responsibility for local transport, how we respond and accommodate local needs is something at the very heart of what I am involved in day-to-day.

The coalition government has placed localism at the centre of its plans. I am pleased to say that we have made considerable progress. This has included the Localism Bill passing through Parliament and now becoming the Localism Act.

However, responding to local needs is about far more than an Act of Parliament. So let me say something about how this is working in the Department for Transport. 

Firstly, our future plans for rail will give local areas more say on their rail services, including a mechanism for local transport bodies, working with the industry, to more easily sponsor additional local services.

I have published our proposals for devolving the funding we provide for local major schemes to local transport bodies that comprise local authorities and local business, through local economic partnerships, working together.

Of course our capital funding via both the integrated transport block and the highway maintenance block is already effectively devolved. This is because what local authorities get is based on established formulae, and the recipients have autonomy in how they use the funds, allowing them to better respond to local needs and priorities.

The Local Sustainable Transport Fund has provided a large number of local authorities, often working together, with £600 million for schemes that create growth and cut carbon at the local level. I am particularly pleased with the wide range of proposals we were able to support, and local councils have come up with imaginative and innovative proposals. Yes, there was competition for the available funding pot, but as many of you know we received applications involving every eligible local authority in England.

The government is playing its part in setting out some high level messages supporting sustainable transport and especially cycling, whilst leaving the detail and delivery very much to be determined at the local level.

The nationwide campaign for road safety has for some years now been based around the THINK branding. I am pleased to say that because of the general upsurge in cycling in recent times - not least because of Team GB's success in the Olympics - we have recently announced a new THINKCYCLIST campaign. The key message is that drivers and cyclists actually have more in common than is often realised. The campaign is therefore about both groups of road users being aware of each other.

The coalition government recognises that well maintained national and local highways are important to the economy, to all road users and to local residents. 

Despite the difficult economic situation we inherited we are providing over £3 billion to councils across England for local road maintenance between 2011 and 2015.

Now I know there is significant scope for many local authorities to change their approach, to emulate the best practice to be found in well-performing authorities, to find efficiencies and to achieve more from their spending on local roads.

In these tight fiscal times, we must all - central and local government alike - use resources much more efficiently to get the best value for money for the taxpayer. 

There are over 150 different highway authorities, very often doing things in quite different ways. It is clear that councils can learn from each other and get more for less. 

This is one of the reasons why I launched the Highways Maintenance Efficiency Programme in April 2011 - a £6 million initiative running until 2018 to improve efficiencies and maximise returns on investment in highways maintenance.

One of the Programme's key hallmarks is that it is sector-led. So, working in partnership it is for local highway authorities and the providers of maintenance services, many of which are from the private sector, to determine the programme's scope and shape its content.

It's also an initiative rooted in this government's commitment to localism, devolution and empowerment.

I am pleased that the Programme's work is now well underway and products like the local highway authority collaborative alliance toolkit have recently been launched. It is already being used by several potential groups of local authorities to form their own alliances.

I understand that several further tools covering asset management and standardisation of contracts and specification are due to be launched this autumn, with others in line for user testing.

I was also pleased to see that the final report of the Pothole Review was published in April and that its recommendations got a good reception. The programme has now put in place an implementation plan to ensure its recommendations are delivered.

I would like to pick up on the customer, quality and cost work being done within the National Highways and Transport Network.

In my view the local authorities responsible for highway maintenance can better respond to local needs in their area, if they have a full picture of all three dimensions. These are:

Firstly, customer perceptions - as revealed by for instance the National Highways and Transport Network survey;

Secondly, quality - the technical quality of carriageways and footways as revealed by the detailed surveys undertaken by highway authorities;

And thirdly, cost - as reflected in the resources spent on maintenance.

Whilst this approach is currently being refined by the National Highways and Transport Network for highways maintenance, the concept may prove equally useful for other aspects of transport such as cycling, walking and road safety.

In conclusion, it is clear to me that work the National Highways and Transport Network undertakes, especially making information on local transport available to local people, is very important. The National Highways and Transport Network both elicits the customer's perception, and also makes it available 'warts and all' to everyone. This is in keeping with the coalition government's policy to increase transparency within all levels of government and throughout the public sector. And having the information widely available allows for analysis and continuous improvement in the outputs and outcomes.

So thank you for listening and I trust you all have an interesting and successful day.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/burns-20120926a,171,"## Introductory remarks

I'd like to kick things off with a very warm welcome to one and all.

A big thank-you too, for making the time and taking the trouble to come along today.

## Open mind

The American politician Adlai Stevenson once said: ""a politician is a person who approaches every subject with an open mouth.""

Well I'm pleased to report that, when it came to reforming ATOL, this Government has turned that stereotype completely on its head.

And that's because we approached the issue with an open mind.

We studied the problem.

We examined the evidence.

And we not only talked to travel-trade stakeholders, industry experts and consumer groups, we listened to them.

I believe the end result is an ATOL scheme that better protects consumers in the 21st century holiday market.

## Time to change

ATOL has done a fantastic job of looking after the interests of consumers down the years.

But it was born in the 1970s. And, as everyone here knows, the way we book holidays and flights has undergone a radical transformation since then, especially with the rise of the internet.

Arguably, the paradox of the internet age is that booking a holiday has become a lot more convenient and a bit more confusing at the same time.

Clicking a mouse when you make that purchase is easy, but it's also sown seeds of doubt about what's covered and what's not, about who's protected and who isn't.

So it was time to change, time to update and modernise.

## Proof of protection & peace of mind

And we've certainly done that by taking two important steps.

First of all we've ended the confusion about whether so called ""Flight Plus"" holidays are included in the ATOL scheme. They are.

But, secondly, as of the 1st of October, when you buy a ""Flight-Plus"" holiday, a package holiday or even a ""Flight Only"" trip that's covered by ATOL, you will get one of these - a standardised ATOL Certificate confirming that you are fully protected.

So, whether you're on a website, in a travel agents or making a booking over the phone there'll be no more uncertainty and no more wondering.

Instead you'll have proof of protection and peace of mind

## Concluding remarks

People will now be able to say with absolutely certainty - ""I'm covered, I'm safe.""

But these reforms don't just mean better protection.

They actually mean better protection for more travellers - millions more in fact.

Add all that up and I think what you've got is a job well done and a change worth celebrating.

So before I conclude my remarks I'd like to pay tribute to everyone in the travel industry whose advice, input and sheer hard work helped make this all possible.

We really couldn't have done it without them.

Okay, nobody ever came to an event like this and said: ""that was a great day, but if only the Minister had spoken for longer.""

So, with that in mind, I'd like to thank you for listening and hand you over to Dame Deidre Hutton, Chair of the CAA.

This speech represented existing departmental policy but the words may not have been the same as those used by the Minister.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/burns-20121022a,172,"## Opening remarks

Thank you Andrew. Ladies and gentlemen.

And thanks to Ed for inviting me to speak today.

Over the years it has become something of a tradition for transport ministers to speak at the AOA conference….

Not only because it's firmly established as one of the most important events in the aviation calendar….

But also because it attracts such a distinguished and expert audience.

So I'm delighted to be here today - and to have this opportunity to talk about the crucial role that aviation has to play in our economic recovery.

## 20 years of change

Now - both the new Secretary of State for Transport Patrick McLoughlin and I are politicians of a certain vintage.

Together we have clocked up more than 25 years of service as MPs, ministers, and whips in government and Opposition - including for Patrick a three year stint as Minister for Aviation in Margaret Thatcher's last government.

Looking back over that time, it's extraordinary to see how the aviation industry has changed….

The deregulation of air travel in Europe, and the proliferation of hundreds of new routes from UK airports….

The low-cost, no-frills revolution, which helped make flying affordable to millions more Britons…

The global reassessment of airport security after 9/11….

And the impact of the internet on the way we shop for flights and holidays.

But while aviation has changed over the past two decades, our job in government remains precisely the same.

Dealing with debt.

Stimulating growth.

Pulling every possible lever to create jobs, attract investment, and help some people get on.

Patrick and I were part of a government that not only experienced the recession of the early 1990s…. but that also took the tough decisions needed to lead our economy out of recession….

Decisions that built a foundation for growth and prosperity lasting well into the following decade.

And that's exactly what we're in government to do again today.

## Transport and growth

I'm excited to be part of the ministerial team at the DfT, because I'm a firm believer in the transformational potential of transport.

In my book, transport doesn't just support growth. It creates it.

One of the reasons why Britain was so powerful in the 18th and 19th centuries was its relatively easy and affordable access to a massive world market.

It was Britain's mastery of trade routes - over sea and over land - that gave us such a huge competitive advantage.

Thanks to transport, Britain had better, faster and cheaper links to raw materials - and to a global customer base - than its rivals.

Today, it is the same ready access that is driving the growth of economies like China, India, and Brazil.

The lessons for developed countries like Britain are clear.

Simply making the best products is of no use if you can't connect with the right market.

For decades, Britain has failed to invest in its transport infrastructure, and we are paying the price today in lost growth.

It's why we are investing in our roads and railways, to reduce congestion and overcrowding, and link businesses with buyers.

It's why we are investing in a new high speed rail network - so firms in Leeds and Manchester and Liverpool can connect with customers in London and Lille.

And it is why - in a fast changing industry like aviation - we need a clear strategy to boost passenger service, and maintain our excellent air links with the rest of the world.

But as I will explain shortly, any such strategy needs to stand firm over a period of more than a decade - and across several General Elections. That is why it is so important that we take the time we need to get this right and to build a strong consensus of opinion behind the best option.

## What we're doing

There has been real progress under this government.

We are taking forward the Civil Aviation Bill to modernise the regulatory framework for civil aviation in the UK. The Bill enables the CAA to bring a strong consumer focus to its activities, improving transparency and accountability, and ensuring a better service for passengers.

The recommendations of the South East Airports Taskforce are being implemented, including a trial of operational freedoms at Heathrow to improve reliability and reduce delay.

We've announced a number of short-term measures to improve operations and stimulate growth, including £500m towards a western rail link to Heathrow….. a review of the UK's visa regime…. and the recruitment of extra border staff at Heathrow….

And in July we published a draft Aviation Policy Framework (APF) and have put it out for formal public consultation - so that the final Framework can be adopted by the end of March 2013.

The final version of this key document will then be a formal statement of government policy setting the high-level parameters within which any new proposals for airport development may be considered.

## Connectivity and hub capacity

These improvements are timely and necessary.

But they will not on their own solve our long-term connectivity and capacity issues.

We are well served today.

The UK is one of the best connected countries on earth.

London has more flights to more destinations than any other city in Europe.

And we are fortunate to have so many flights to important trading partners - and global financial centres - like New York, Singapore and Hong Kong.

In what is still a dynamic market, new routes and services continue to be added.

From the end of this month, for instance, the UK will be served by daily flights to Guangzhou - a city that has been held up in the past as an example of our national failure to secure routes into the developing Chinese market.

New services to Mexico City were announced only last week.

And of course new destinations are being offered all the time.

But UK aviation is not only about the South East of England.

We are fortunate in this country to have so many excellent airports outside London, which not only help attract inward investment, and provide access to the global market…they also act as major employers in their own right.

Of course the downturn has affected most AOA members, just like it has businesses throughout the economy.

But many airports outside London and the South East continue to perform exceptionally well considering the wider economic picture.…

From Manchester, which saw passenger numbers rise by 6% to 19 million in 2011, to Belfast International, and Aberdeen.

This growth is being supported by significant investment - at airports like Birmingham, Newcastle, and Bristol - to boost capacity and improve the passenger experience.

However; the growth of airports throughout the UK cannot disguise the wider reality that Britain has failed to follow Germany, France and the Netherlands in planning for our long-term connectivity needs.

The danger is that we risk seeing our direct European competitors benefiting more from the fast growing markets of emerging economies.

## Difficult decision

So we are absolutely clear.

Maintaining the UK's status as a leading global aviation hub is fundamental to our long term international competitiveness.

Yet - at the same time - we must also take full account of the social, environmental and other impacts of any expansion in airport capacity.

This is one of the most difficult debates in transport.

Few other issues have the same potential to provoke a divided response.

Successive governments have sought to develop a credible long term aviation policy to meet the international connectivity needs of the UK……

And in each case the policy has failed.

Either trust in the process has broken down….. consensus on the evidence for the policy has drained away…… or it has proved too difficult to sustain a challenging long term policy through a change of government.

Not only can the aviation industry ill afford for this indecision and failure to continue.

The country can't afford it either.

## Commission

So the government has asked Sir Howard Davies to chair an independent Airports Commission.

Sir Howard's remit is to identify and recommend the options for maintaining this country's status as a global hub for aviation - and indeed as Europe's most important aviation hub.

The Commission will also evaluate how any additional capacity requirements should be met in the short, medium and long term.

The Coalition Agreement is clear, and continues to represent the position of this government.

But the Commission must consider all options if it to reach the best conclusions.

That includes a third runway at Heathrow, and schemes in the Thames Gateway proposed by the Mayor of London and by Norman Foster.

The Commission will be fair and open, taking account of the views of passengers, residents, the aviation industry, business, local and devolved government and environmental groups.

An interim report will be prepared for government no later than the end of 2013, and a final report by the summer of 2015.

We will be in a position to tell you more about the membership of the Commission and its terms of reference in the next few weeks.

The Commission's work will not clash in any way with the draft Aviation Policy Framework.

In fact it will complement it.

When we publish the final Policy Framework next year, it will still establish the high level aviation policy of this government.

That means it will set the parameters within which Sir Howard will consider the aviation needs of this country - and the options for delivering those needs in the short, medium and longer terms.

The Framework consultation is therefore an important opportunity to influence government aviation policy.

I want to thank those of you who have engaged with us during the consultation - and encourage those who have not submitted a response to do so in the next few weeks before the end of this process.

## Conclusion

Now of course I can't speculate on what the conclusions of the Commission will be.

But what I can assure you of is the importance of this work - and the determination of this government to find a solution that's best for Britain.

We will seek to involve the Opposition throughout the process.

And I hope all main parties will back Sir Howard's findings - because it's crucial that we make a commitment that transcends party politics.

The Olympics have shown just what we can do if we are willing to make big decisions, work together, and stay the course.

The success of the transport system during the Games was the result of co-ordinated planning by the Coalition and the previous government, Transport for London, the Department for Transport, and many other organisations over many years.

I would like to pay tribute to many of the companies and organisations represented here today who worked so hard during the Olympics to provide such a welcoming and professional service to visitors who flew in from all over the world.

This was a major logistical challenge for the aviation industry.

Many predicted failure.

But you showed a real spirit of collaboration and collective determination to turn it into a triumph.

And it is that same spirit - of working in partnership towards common goals - that we need to foster again…. once conclusions have been drawn from the work of the Commission and the Aviation Policy Framework.

I think we all realise that we are living through some of the toughest economic conditions for generations.

But we are also living through a time of great opportunity.

Either we can repeat history, and fail once again to confront the infrastructure problems which hold our economy back.

Or we can learn the lessons from history, and build a better future for Britain.

That is what we are doing in government. And with your help, that is what we will do.

Thank-you very much indeed.

Thank you for that introduction Ian (Ian Taylor - travel writer/journalist & conference host).

And thank you also to everyone at the Guild for asking me along, it's a genuine pleasure to be here today.

## Can't & won't ignore the facts

Now, I'm not sure if there are any fans of the ""Yes Minister"" TV series in the audience.

For those of you too young to remember, ""Yes Minister"" was the 1980s version of ""The Thick of it"" but without the four letter words. 

Well, there's one scene where the civil servant, Sir Humphrey Appleby, says of the Minister Jim Hacker - ""if he can't ignore the facts he's no business being a politician.""

To be honest, based on that definition of politics I'm definitely in the wrong profession.

And that's because, when it comes to the relationship between Britain's transport system and Britain's business travellers I can't, and I won't, ignore the facts.

And the facts are these:

  * Today we have to earn our living and pay our way in a fast moving global economy.
  * A global economy in which this Association's members face cut-throat competition. 
  * A global economy where the state of your transport system can be the difference between missing a meeting or making a deal…between winning a contract or losing a customer.

And I have to tell you that those facts have not been lost on the countries we compete against.

They know that creaking and crumbling transport links are a business burden that cost time and money.

Look around the world - the evidence is there in plain sight.

From North America to Latin America, and from our continental neighbours to the emerging economic powers of China and India, nation after nation is upgrading and expanding their transport infrastructure

Every bridge they construct, every road they repair and every track they lay is a boost for their businesses and their economies. 

So we really don't have the luxury of sitting back and looking on while our rivals invest in world class transport.

They are our competition in the international marketplace, the economies we're up against in a race to win the future. 

And, if we're going to out-produce, out-innovate and out-sell them, we cannot afford to be left behind in the starting blocks.

## Status quo - Latin for the mess we're in

That's something this Guild and its members understand only too well

You know better than anyone that ours is a trading nation, as well as an island nation.

A nation where what we sell in Boston or Shanghai is just as important as what we make in Bristol or Sheffield.

That's the reality. 

It's the reason you have consistently called for a transport system that is high quality and high performance - one that helps, not hinders, our business travellers.

Well, I want you to know that we hear what you say

And trust me…those aren't just warm words from a minister. The record proves that this is an issue where we are on your side and in your corner.

In fact, the minute we took office, this government made it clear that maintaining the transport status quo was not an option.

After all, as someone once said, ""status quo is simply Latin for the mess we're in""

Believe me, that translation has more than a ring of transport truth about it because frankly, we didn't just inherit a financial deficit back in May 2010, we inherited an infrastructure deficit too.

And that's precisely why we took the deliberate decision to focus time, effort and resources on making Britain's transport networks fit for the 21st century.

Now, I'll admit that the DfT hasn't enjoyed its best media coverage lately.

And I don't for one minute seek to carp or complain about that coverage

Serious matters like the west coast mainline bid tend to generate serious headlines. 

They also demand a serious response - which is why we are facing up to what went wrong and putting things right.

None-the less, I genuinely hope that none of the recent coverage obscures the bigger transport picture.

Because, I can say with absolute conviction that there has been real success and welcome progress on many of the transport issues that matter most to the people you represent.

## Renewing & rebuilding the railways 

Take the way we're renewing and rebuilding the railways that so many of your members use and rely on.

We're engaged in a massive modernisation effort. And just this summer we announced a new rail investment programme worth more than £9 billion.

We're driving through landmark projects like Crossrail, Thameslink and the Northern Hub.

We're going to electrify more than 850 miles of track.

And, right across the country, we're making rail travel a whole lot better with new services and extra carriages, more seats and faster journeys.

But our focus doesn't begin and end with the conventional railways.

Just like this Guild, the government recognise the huge benefits of high speed rail.

But again, just like you, we also know that our country and our economy need more than a high speed line - they need a high speed network.

And that's exactly what we're committed to building with HS2.

A network that not only links London and Birmingham. 

But one that also speeds further north to Manchester and Leeds, and possibly to Edinburgh and Glasgow.

A network that not only opens up business opportunities at home.

But one that also opens up business opportunities abroad by ensuring passengers have an opportunity to connect up with the Channel Tunnel rail link (HS1) and Heathrow airport.

HS2 will transform the way we live and work every bit as much as it transforms the way we travel

So make no mistake, the government is determined to push this project across the finishing line.

## First class highways

But of course, business travellers don't just need top-notch railways - they also need first rate highways. 

So we've been investing in this country's roads and motorways too:

  * Cutting congestion by removing bottlenecks and tackling pinch points on vital corridors like the M5 and the M27
  * Using innovations like hard shoulder running and managed motorways to unlock capacity on crucial arteries like the M1 and the M25
  * Even supporting the uptake of electric cars with a nationwide network of re-charging points.

All this, and more, is designed to help motorists here and now.

But we've also been thinking carefully about the key long-term challenges by undertaking a major Feasibility Study: 

  * Looking at how we can best secure new investment capital 
  * Reviewing new models of ownership and financing
  * And weighing up the most effective and efficient ways to maintain and modernise our strategic road network 

Today and tomorrow - modern highways for a modern Britain.

That's our vision, and that's what we're working hard to deliver.

## Aviation 

Having spoken about rail and road, let me now turn a subject that rarely fails to generate debate and discussion - aviation.

Ever since the Wright Brothers defied gravity, air travel has shrunk our world.

But, in doing so, it has also broadened our horizons - personal and business 

So it's little wonder that issues like airport capacity and connectivity are high on the agenda for this Guild and its members.

Well, as the minister responsible for aviation, my response is the same. 

I'm with you - aviation is a big deal. It matters, it counts.

So let me quickly walk you through some of the things being done to make sure the aviation sector is successful and sustainable 

We're steering the Civil Aviation Bill through Parliament - legislation that will improve the passenger experience by reforming the 25 year old set of regulations that currently govern our main airports.

We're just about to finish consulting on our draft Aviation Policy Framework- a framework that forms the basis for future sustainable aviation growth in the UK. 

To increase reliability and reduce delays we've been trialling operational freedoms at Heathrow

And, from electrifying rail tracks to building new rail links, we're improving the connections between the train and the plane at airports like Stansted and Cardiff, Luton and Manchester, Birmingham and Heathrow, Gatwick and Coventry.

These are all global gateways to new markets and new customers.

And they're all set to become much easier places to get to, and fly from, when you're travelling on business.

We're thinking ahead too. 

We need to make sure that the future of aviation in Britain is one where our airports are globally competitive and where you can connect to places all over the world.

And I'm not talking about the future as just the next 4, 5, 6 years - but in terms of the next 4, 5 and 6 decades.

Capacity, connectivity, hub status - aviation faces long-term challenges that require long-term solutions.

And lots of people and lots of organisations have ideas about how to meet those challenges, including this Guild.

That's why we've asked Sir Howard Davies to chair an independent Airports Commission to consider the connectivity needs of the UK, and to make recommendations to government on how those needs can be met.

And I expect that Sir Howard will soon be setting out further details on the membership of the Commission and its work, including how he intends engaging with interested parties.

The government is determined to build the consensus needed to deliver a lasting solution to the issue of the UK's aviation capacity and we believe that Sir Howard Davies' Commission is the way to do that. 

So yes, the Commission is in its early stages, but we are convinced that it will deliver and help us to maintain the UK's hub status. 

## Wi-fi

There's one last area I want to talk about.

It's not the usual ""planes, trains and automobiles"" stuff of business travel. But, in today's internet driven world, it's perhaps just as important.

I'm talking about Wi-fi connections.

The modern business traveller doesn't just ply their trade in face to face meetings.

With a smart phone, a lap-top or the latest touch-screen tablet they work on the move, they work at home and they work outside of normal office hours.

And that makes fast and reliable Wi-fi connections a business must, a business essential.

You know it. Your members know it. And I'm pleased to be able to tell you that this government knows it too.

We've made broadband one of our top infrastructure priorities and published a National Broadband Strategy. 

We've set up a ""Broadband Delivery UK"" team in Whitehall.

We've given that team £530 million to help bring superfast broadband to homes and businesses across the country.

And we've announced a special £100 million fund to help ten major cities become ""super-connected cities.""

This country's Britain's business travellers deserve world class Wi-fi connections, as well world class transport connections - and we're working hard to delver both.

## Concluding remarks

If Britain's transport networks are its arteries of trade, then this Guild's members are surely the heartbeat.

Our business travellers - clocking up the miles, putting in the hard graft, making sure that Britain is always open for business.

So, before I conclude, I just wanted to pay tribute to the work you do and the difference you make - this minister and this government recognise, value and appreciate everything you're doing. 

Okay, having started off with a quote from a British comedy, I'd liked to finish off with one by an American President - Harry Truman.

President Truman once offered the following advice on public speaking - ""If you can't convince 'em, confuse 'em.""

Well, I hope that in speaking to you today I've been more convincing than confusing. I've certainly enjoyed having this chance to come along and talk about some of the things we're doing to support the crucial work you do.

So I thank you for you time. I thank you for listening. And I look forward to working with you all in the months and years ahead.

Thank you.

This speech represented existing departmental policy but the words may not have been the same as those used by the minister.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/burns-20121029b,174,"## Introductory remarks

Thank you for that introduction Julie (Julie Hilling - Chair of APPG). And many thanks for asking me along today. 

The reputation of this group and its members as rail champions for the north really does go before you, so I'm genuinely delighted to be here. 

I'd like to kick things off with a promise - always a hostage to fortune for a politician I know.

But anyway, here it is.

I know you all have packed diaries and busy schedules - so I promise to try and keep my speech short.

I was going to say keep it ""brief"".

But, since becoming a minister, I've discovered that Whitehall is the only place on earth where, without a trace of irony, the term ""brief"" is used to describe a ten thousand word document.

Modern enough, connected enough, fast enough

Now, I have a pretty straightforward view about Britain's rail network, and it's this - out-dated and over-burdened railways just won't cut it in today's global economy. 

They cost hard working families and hard pressed businesses time and money. And, in these testing economic times, you can be sure they are anything but an engine for powering up the recovery.

They don't do our environment too many favours either. 

Let's be honest, relying on creaking and crumbling rail infrastructure is no way to shrink transport's carbon footprint.

So, it doesn't matter if it's a regional link or a national network - Britain needs railways that are modern enough, connected enough and fast enough:

  * Modern enough to support economic growth and spur job creation.
  * Connected enough to spread prosperity and open up life-changing chances for people.
  * And fast enough to attract passengers and freight away from less eco-friendly alternatives like long-distance road travel and short-haul flying.

## Rolling up our sleeves

I am absolutely convinced that a good rail system can do great things - socially, economically and environmentally.

But, as we all know, the good and the great don't come about simply because politicians are very keen on them. 

No, you only get concrete results by rolling up your sleeves and getting on with it. And that's precisely what this government's been doing on rail:

  * £18 billion invested in our railways during this Spending Review period.
  * A massively ambitious programme of rail modernisation
  * And a range of groundbreaking reforms…. …from driving down costs and driving up efficiencies to devolving decision-making.

Indeed, on the second of those reforms, devolution, I know that there was a big response from people and organisations in the north to our rail decentralisation consultation…so I want to thank everyone who took the trouble to have their say.

No community left out, no region left behind.

This is a government that believes in top quality railways. 

And that belief is underpinned by a rock-solid principle. Namely that no community should be left out, no region should be left behind. 

As far as I'm concerned, if we want all of Britain to be open for business then we can't afford for any part of Britain to be isolated or disconnected from the country's wider transport system. 

Local, and actually national success, demands that north, south, east and west are plugged in and joined up.

## Transforming the performance & prospects of rail in the north

This is the very reason that transforming the performance and the prospects of rail in the north is a first order priority for the government.

Now, when it comes to one particular component of rail services in the north, I'll admit that the DfT hasn't enjoyed its best media coverage lately. I'm of course talking about the west coast mainline bid.

And I don't for one minute seek to carp or complain about that coverage.

Serious matters tend to generate serious headlines. 

They also demand a serious response…which is why we are facing up to what went wrong and putting things right.

None-the less, I genuinely hope that none of the recent coverage obscures the bigger, and more positive, picture about what's happening to rail in the north.

Take our recent approval of a £4.5 billion contract to build a new generation of intercity trains at a purpose-built factory in County Durham. 

This means that passengers will be speeding along the tracks onboard new high-tech, high-spec trains. 

But there's also a welcome employment bonus, with the creation of 730 skilled jobs, as well as another 200 jobs during construction.

And let's not forget our HLOS announcement - a £9.4 billion investment programme that will uplift rail capacity and improve rail connections right across the north.

I'm also pleased to say that work is well underway on the north-west electrification scheme….improving travel between Manchester and Liverpool.

But we're not stopping there.

Because we also intend building a brand new electric passenger and freight corridor - a rail spine linking the towns, cities and economies of the North, with the towns, cities and economies of the Midlands and south of England such as Sheffield, Nottingham, Reading and Southampton. 

The electric trains that run on these lines will be cleaner and cheaper to run than diesels.

They'll have better acceleration and shift greater loads.

And they'll carry more passengers with fewer delays.

In plain English our investment is good for passengers, good for business and good for the environment.

I can also tell you that funding worth some £240 million will mean that rail users in the North enjoy more seats, quicker journeys and better services on the East Coast Main Line.

And of course, the communities and companies of the region are set to be big winners from the backing the government is giving to the northern hub.  
And let me say this - the Northern Hub is about the transforming the rail experience across the whole North, from Newcastle in the north-east to Liverpool in the north-west. 

Now, in terms of travel benefits this is a genuine landmark enterprise. 

But there's even better news

And that's because Network Rail estimate the northern hub will also bring over £4 billion worth of wider economic benefits to the region and potentially as many twenty to thirty thousand new jobs. 

If you'll forgive the unintended pun, looking down the track there is another game-changing rail modernisation heading towards the North - HS2. 

This national high speed rail network will slash journey times and deliver a step change in capacity on routes between Leeds, Sheffield, Birmingham, London and Manchester - and possibly to Edinburgh and Glasgow.

Firms in the north will be able to use HS2 to exploit new markets and attract new investment.

While the region's communities will have better access to jobs and essential services.

HS2 is a core component of the government's long-term transport strategy.

And so, for the sake of every region, it's a project we're determined to push across the finishing line. 

## Concluding remarks

Okay, I think it's time I kept the promise I made right at the start of this speech by winding up my remarks.

And let's be frank, nobody ever complained that a politician's' speech was too short.

So, if I may, I'd like to finish with a quote by one of America's founding fathers, Benjamin Franklin.

Now I grant you that's a less than orthodox way to end a rail speech. 

But, for me, this quote sums up our approach to rail modernisation.

Back in the 18th century Ben Franklin argued that, when it came to governing, ""well done is better than well said.""

If you ask me, that's a yardstick which still stands the test of time.

But I'm equally sure that, judged against it, the way this government is renewing, rebuilding and reforming our railways proves that, just like the great man said - actions really do speak louder than words.

Thank you.

This speech represented existing departmental policy but the words may not have been the same as those used by the minister.

 
",Department for Transport,All party parliamentary rail in the north group reception,31 October 2012,"Speech by the Rt Hon Simon Burns MP, Minister of State for Transport.",The Rt Hon Simon Burns,2012-10-31,Speech,Rail
http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/hammond-20121022a,175,"## Introduction

I'd like to begin by thanking Place London for inviting me to today's event, and to Richard [Barnes, Chair] for that kind introduction.

It's wonderful to see so many people here with an interest in this part of the city.

I may be new to this ministerial brief, but I'm not new to London. As MP for Wimbledon, this is my home patch.

So I can reassure you that investment in the infrastructure, regeneration, and the economy of West and South West London is very close to my heart.

This year we've seen London host a spectacular Olympic and Paralympic Games.

The Olympic Park might have been in East London, but the whole city embraced the Games, including West London with events at Wembley and Earl's Court.

London 2012 - we planned, we built and we delivered.

So we can all take pride in the way our Capital showed itself to the world this year.

As a city that takes massive infrastructure projects in its stride.

As a city that deals with huge numbers of commuters, visitors and residents.

And as a city that successfully staged the greatest show on earth.

The challenge is to keep up that momentum, and make sure we're planning ahead so that London stays where it should be - at the top of the list of world cities.

That will require continued investment in transport.

To relieve congestion as the city grows.

To make new links, connecting people and businesses

And to support regeneration projects that are vital to development.

This government is putting in the resources because we know that giving people and businesses access to a high quality, high performance transport system makes sense for our country's future prosperity.

That's why, in the current Spending Review period, we committed £30 billion to road, rail and local transport projects across the country.

But we also understand that investment is vital for our capital

  * to support a labour productivity rate here in London that's more than 31% above the national average.
  * to maintain the City's position as the world's number one financial centre
  * and to fuel an economy that accounts for around 19% of UK GDP

London is Britain's economic engine.

And, by investing in the transport infrastructure that serves and supports the Capital, we can keep that engine powered, for the benefit of the whole country.

## Aviation

I know that, for many of you, aviation is one of the key transport issues at the moment, especially on this side of London.

So there's a legitimate debate to be had about the future of aviation.

But it's important that debate is informed by the facts rather than by anecdote.

In Heathrow, we've got the busiest international airport anywhere in the world.

And our Capital and our country are among the best connected places on the planet.

Without question we are in the global aviation premier league.

But as my colleague the Secretary of State reminded us in his recent Party Conference Speech in Birmingham, it's not going to last, if we don't act.

Birmingham, Manchester, Glasgow, Edinburgh all have first rate airports too.

But in the south east the runways are filling up and the planes are being left to circle in our skies.

So in the short term we're increasing reliability and reducing delays by trialling operational freedoms at Heathrow

But it's vital that we think long-term about how we remain globally competitive and globally connected.

Of course there are all sorts of ideas - usually as many ideas as there are people in the room.

So we've asked Sir Howard Davies to chair an independent Airports Commission to consider the connectivity needs of the UK, and to make recommendations to government on how those needs can be met.

The Commission will provide an interim report to the government no later than the end of 2013 and then publish a final report by the summer of 2015.

I expect that Sir Howard will soon be setting out further details on the membership of the Commission and its work….including how he intends engaging with interested parties.

So, if you class yourself as an interested party, then watch this space.

## Investment in London's transport infrastructure

I'd like to talk now about some of the other transport projects that are already underway.

Improving the road networks that serve London for example.

Whether it's working with TfL and ensuring that utility companies speed up their road-work, or it's easing congestion on key strategic roads, like the M25, through innovations such as hard shoulder running and managed motorway technology.

Then there's the Tube upgrade programme - work that will deliver a 30% increase in the capacity of the Tube network.

West London is already starting to see the benefits; the entire fleet has been replaced on the Metropolitan Line, with 58 new longer, air-conditioned trains, with the same to follow on the Hammersmith and City Line.

Also in West London, Royal Oak has seen the first two Crossrail Tunnel Boring Machines begin their journey under the city.

When completed, Crossrail will deliver faster journey times and a 10% uplift in capacity.

It will bring an additional 1.5 million people within 45 minutes of London's business centres.

And it will support employment growth of up to 30,000 jobs by 2026 in Central London.

The Crossrail scheme as planned will deliver 8 new underground stations in the central section.

27 upgraded and reconstructed surface stations.

And up to 14,000 jobs during the peak construction period in 2014.

By 2026, we estimate it will carry 200 million passengers each year.

The impact will be felt all the way along its route, not just in central London.

Crossrail is already having an impact on investment decisions, supporting and accelerating new development.

This includes thousands of new homes, and millions of square metres of commercial office space within one kilometre of stations along the route.

Recent research has estimated that residential capital values immediately around stations could increase by 25% in central London and by 20% in the suburbs.

But despite all the planned investment in the tube and Crossrail, demand forecasts show that, without additional investment, crowding will return to unacceptable levels by 2030.

So thinking is needed now about how to address this challenge.

One option championed by many in the business community is Crossrail 2.

Something I know TfL are studying closely…and I look forward to reading their analysis when it's completed.

Then there are TfL's proposals to extend the Northern Line from Kennington to Battersea.

This is an extension that would improve transport links and support the transformation of Nine Elms and Vauxhall, a designated regeneration area on the South Bank.

Up to 25,000 jobs and 16,000 new homes could be created and journey times from Nine Elms or Battersea to the West End or the City would, in some cases, be less than 15 minutes.

## HS2

Rail capacity will also get a major boost from HS2, our national high speed rail network.

HS2 has the potential to transform the entire country's social and economic geography.

But think about the potential positives for London:

  * better connectivity and faster journeys between economy of London and the South East and the economies of the Midlands and the North
  * our major cities brought closer to the Capital and closer to the cities of Europe
  * new opportunities, new markets and new customers for London's businesses

This is a project that makes sense for Britain and London, which is why this government is giving it our full on, flat out backing.

## Future sources of funding

As this audience will know, government grant funding for TfL - currently over £3bn a year - provides an important source of funding.

But in a world of constrained public sector resources we need to encourage other sources of investment too.

So we're working with Treasury colleagues to accelerate major infrastructure investment, looking at new ways to unlock new sources of capital, from international sovereign wealth funds to UK pension funds.

And we also want to enable the Mayor and TfL and London Boroughs to share in the profits of London's growth, giving them an even greater incentive to invest in business-friendly measures, a positive spiral for London.

Reforms to local government finance will see part of TfL's funding come from business rates in the capital, rather than traditional grant from central government.

This Business Rates Retention scheme, due to start in April 2013, will see London and other local authorities retain a share of the growth in business rates.

This is positive news for London.

It's also a real incentive for the GLA, the Mayor and the Boroughs to work with business to grow jobs and to grow prosperity.

## Removing barriers to investment

This government understands that a modern economy needs a modern transport system.

So, for us, the DfT is as much a Department for Growth as it is as a Department for Transport.

But we also recognise that, to get Britain moving you need to do more than invest in infrastructure and regeneration.

You also have to knock down the barriers that get in the way of growth and development.

So, we're also reforming our employment laws.

We're modernising our planning regulations.

And we're cutting corporation tax and getting rid of unnecessary regulations.

In other words, we're freeing up our risk takers and wealth creators by giving business the room to grow and the conditions to invest.

## Conclusion

In conclusion.

I've argued that, in large part, the prosperity of our Capital and our Country depends on the quality of our transport networks.

And I've set out some of the key steps we're taking to modernise those vital networks.

Now, when we came to office, faced with the state of the national finances we could have taken the easy option.

We could have adopted a slash and burn approach to transport investment.

After all, it's what governments have done in the past when the fiscal going got tough.

But just like the people in this audience we understand that there's a heavy price to pay when transport networks are clogged up, stretched to breaking point or past their best.

And, just like, you we know that cost is measured in lower growth and fewer jobs, now and in the future.

So, if there's just one message I'd like you to take away with you today, it is this - we have called time on worn out and run down transport infrastructure.

A government that's driving through programmes and projects, investments and innovations that will transform our transport links and our economic prospects.

A government that is engaging in constructive partnership with the dynamic potential of the private sector, as well as building on the strengths of the public sector.

Coming together to make a real and last difference.

Working together to keep London and Britain moving.

Thank you.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/mcloughlin-20121011a,176,"## Opening Remarks

Many thanks for that introduction David (Prof David Begg, Transport Times).

And David, looking around tonight I can see that you're someone who knows how to put on a great show.

But you're also one of most recognised and respected voices in transport.

So, as well as thanking you and your colleagues for the hard work you've put into these impressive awards, I just wanted to express my personal gratitude for your contribution to transport down the years. Long may it continue.

I also want to say a big-thank you for asking me along to an event where I get to share the stage with Jeremy Vine.

Jeremy, it's great to be on the ""bill"" with you tonight. Although, having looked at your CV, I am starting to feel a bit like a serious under-achiever.

There's something important I want to say before anything else.

These awards remind us of the incredible job the people in the transport industry do.

So I just want you to know that this Transport Secretary and this Government recognise, value and appreciate everything you do.

While I have the chance I also wanted to say a very quick word about a subject the transport industry is very familiar with - and that's change.

I realise that changing ministers can be disruptive.

And I know that transport has had its fair share of changes under all governments.

Indeed, there are said to be more former transport secretaries alive than for any other Cabinet job.

So I want to say this:

I am serious about transport.

It's a job I wanted.

It's a job where there is much to do.

## West Coast Mainline

It's also a job where the challenges come thick and fast.

And, as Transport Secretary, I won't be hiding from any of them.

There will be setbacks as well as successes.

This month, when we hit one on the West Coast line, I came straight out and confronted it.

The mistakes made with the West Coast Mainline franchise bid were deeply regrettable and completely unacceptable.

So I've ordered two independent reviews.

The first will report back by the end of this month, the second by the end of the year.

This is a serious issue, and it's getting a serious response.

But let me be clear.

This is not about re-winding to a pre-privatisation past.

This is about learning lessons and moving forward with franchising so that future competitions are robust and deliver best value for passengers and tax payers.

And, while I'm on the subject of delivering value for money, there's another challenge I've faced up to since taking this job - and that's the cost of rail fares.

These are tough and testing times. And I want to help where I can.

So I'm pleased that I've been able to secure funds so that we can cut by 2% the planned increase in key rail fares. And not just for 2013, but for 2014 too.

## Coming home to the DfT

Now, although I may be the new boy at these awards, this isn't my first time at the Department for Transport.

I actually joined the Department in 1989, when Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister.

I started off as Roads Minister

Then I became the Minister responsible for Aviation and Maritime.

Mind you, seeing as I was afraid of flying, as well as the MP for the most landlocked constituency in the country, ""the Minister for Irony"" might have been a more suitable job title.

Well I'm still proud to represent that same constituency

But I'm pleased to tell you that I'm totally cured of my fear of flying.

Now of course a lot of things have changed in the years since then.

I've certainly got more grey hair.

And I've definitely put on a few pounds.

But one thing remains exactly the same - and that's the crucial importance of our transport links.

And that's why I'm proud to come home to the DfT.

## Introduce myself

I have to say that I'm really excited too.

Excited about the transport milestones the Government has already reached in the first half of this Parliament.

But also excited about our big plans and bold ambitions for the second half of the Parliament and beyond.

So, I could use today's speech to highlight our investment record - a Spending Review that committed £30 billion for transport projects right across the country.

I could explain how we're speeding up journeys and cutting congestion on the roads with innovations like managed motorways.

Or, I could focus on our plans to electrify more than 850 miles of rail track.

I could talk about all the things we're doing to devolve power and give local communities a real say about their transport.

Or I could tell you about our determination to build on Britain's summer of cycling success - encouraging more people to take to two wheels and building safety into our roads. As I said in Birmingham this week, it's something we need to act on.

I could even dedicate the entire speech to HS2.

A high speed rail network that isn't just about taking 20 minutes off the journey to Birmingham, but is actually about shaping and transforming Britain for the next two hundred years.

A network that has cross party support, as well this Government's full commitment.

A network that, like all big infrastructure projects in our history, starts off with controversy, but will end up being used and valued by everyone. Including the people who criticised it.

I could do all of that. But I won't.

Because, rather than talk about transport policy to an audience of transport policy experts, what I'd really like to do is introduce myself properly…

To tell you a little bit about my approach to this job and the principles that will guide me over the coming months and years.

## The Secretary of State for all of transport

I should also tell you that that I'm not in the business of favouring railways over roads or maritime over aviation.

So, as we get the money in and the schemes underway.

As we rebuild, renew and reform.

I will be the Secretary of State for all of transport.

## Reduce the hassle

The next thing you need to know about me is that I speak plainly. But I think big.

You won't catch me using jargon like ""calling points"" instead of stations.

I'm ambitious about transport because I'm ambitious for Britain.

Transport is the artery of any economy.

It gets people to work, children to school and food to the shops.

When transport slows, everything slows.

When transport stops, everything stops.

Everyone depends on transport every day.

So when people ask: ""what's your aim in the job?""

My answer is straightforward - my task is to reduce the hassle of getting around.

## Constructive co-operation, common ground

But I know that's not a one-person job.

So I want to engage and work with the transport industry.

And I could summarise my approach in two words - constructive co-operation.

Coming together and working together on common ground.

The common ground where we can find workable solutions to the big transport challenges out there.  
That's the approach I want to take.

Tonight is a celebration of your achievements and I know you're keen to get on with it.

So it's time I finished up. And as my wife always tells me - nobody will ever complain if a politician's speech is too short.

## The nominees

Before I conclude though, I just wanted to say something about the shortlist for this year's awards.

And, to do that, I'd like to look back to this summer's fantastic festival of sport, the 2012 London Games.

As far as I'm concerned, it wasn't just our Olympians and Paralympians who delivered the goods.

Because, this summer our transport networks and our transport industry were put to the test like never before.

And they were brilliant.

So you should all feel rightly proud.

As indeed should tonight's nominees.

Tonight's short-list ranges from small local initiatives to big national projects.

And from teams who developed innovations in transport technology…to individuals who radically improved customer service.

Every nominee is different.

But, having seen that short-list, I know that you all share something in common - excellence.

## Concluding remarks

Some people wonder all their lives if they make a difference.

Well, that's not a problem for tonight's nominees, or indeed for anyone working in this country's transport industry.

Because in making a difference to transport you are making a difference to Britain.

That's why it's an honour to share this special evening with you.

That's why it's great to be back at the DfT.

And that's why I'm looking forward to working with all of you.

And on that note it just remains for me to thank-you for listening and to wish good luck to everyone who's waiting nervously to hear if they've won an award.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/baker-20120911a,177,"**The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Norman Baker)**: Today I am publishing our response to the comments received in the [consultation on our proposals to implement Articles 7a to 7e of the EU Fuel Quality Directive (Directive 98/70/EC as amended by Directive 2009/30/EC)](http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/dft-2011-04/). The Directive requires suppliers to reduce the lifecycle greenhouse gas intensity of many transport fuels.

The response sets out our decision to introduce new secondary legislation to transpose requirements of the Fuel Quality Directive, including new annual reporting requirements for fossil fuels and biofuels.

The document also details our commitment to amend the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligations Order 2007 (""RTFO Order 2007"") to include fuels used in non-road mobile machinery, a policy already announced to the House on July 16 when the Department published a related consultation response (Official report, 16 July 2012, Column 112WS).

An amendment made in December 2011 to the RTFO Order 2007 means that only biofuels meeting minimum sustainability criteria count towards renewable energy targets. Sustainable biofuels play an important role in our efforts to tackle climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector. However, concerns remain about the sustainability of some biofuels, especially around the issue of indirect land use change (""ILUC"") and we are pressing the European Commission and other Member States to produce a robust method to address this issue. Pending that clarity we are taking a cautious approach to implementing the Fuel Quality Directive.

The Fuel Quality Directive introduces the requirement for many transport fuel suppliers to reduce the greenhouse gas intensity of the fuels they supply by 6% in 2020. We will not impose on suppliers a greenhouse gas reduction obligation at this point. Instead, we will place an ongoing legal duty on the Secretary of State to propose any further measures necessary to ensure delivery of the requirements of the Fuel Quality Directive. We will rely on the amended RTFO Order 2007 to deliver the greenhouse gas savings necessary under the Fuel Quality Directive for the period up to 2014. We will also put in place a requirement for fuel suppliers to report on the greenhouse gas intensity of both the biofuel and fossil fuels they supply for use in land-based transport and for the associated uses listed in the Directive.

This approach allows us to transpose the Fuel Quality Directive at the minimum cost to UK business.

I would like to thank all those who took the time to respond to the consultation.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/baker-20120917a,179,"**The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Norman Baker)**: I would like to inform the House of the [decision that has been made in relation to London Midland's application to change Schedule 17 of the Ticketing and Settlement Agreement (TSA)](/publications/london-midland-ticket-office-opening-hours-decision), which was referred to the Department for Transport for arbitration.

The TSA sets out the various arrangements between train operators relating to the carriage of passengers and the retailing of tickets. London Midland's proposal was to change the minimum opening hours of a number of ticket offices, including the closure of nine offices altogether. These changes would not affect the level of train services in any way.

I have decided to approve London Midland's proposal in part, but reject some elements where the case for changes has not been made. Ticket offices at Small Heath, Jewellery Quarter, Bescot Stadium, Duddeston and Adderley Park, which were proposed for closure, will remain open. However, I have agreed four of the nine proposed ticket office closures, at Wythall, Witton, Lye and Cheddington.

Several ticket offices will have their opening hours extended, while a number of other stations will have their ticket office opening hours reduced. A full list of the changes has been published on the Department's website.

In arbitrating this decision, we were careful to ensure that the proposal was in line with the criteria set out in the TSA, whereby passengers continue to enjoy widespread and easy access to the purchase of rail products, and that the proposal represents an improvement in terms of quality of service and/or cost-effectiveness.

I have also ensured that no particular group of rail users is affected disproportionately by the changes, particularly passengers with disabilities.

The changes reflect the change in the way passengers are buying tickets, with more choosing to purchase their tickets online or at ticket vending machines, and the changes that have been approved will not generally affect stations during periods in which the ticket office is currently selling more than 12 tickets an hour.

As a condition of the changes, London Midland will also be required to provide a total of 29 additional ticket vending machines at stations that do not currently have this facility. This will be an improvement in availability at stations where the ticket office is currently only open part-time, with passengers in future able to purchase tickets whenever they wish to travel.

We have also ensured that London Midland will keep lifts in operation when stations are unstaffed. LM will also improve safety and security at stations, including through the provision of upgraded CCTV at 11 stations and will provide additional shelters and upgraded signage as a condition of this approval.

In addition, London Midland will invest in 30 new train boarding ramps to improve access to trains for wheelchair users. Passengers who require assistance in making their journey can now book this via the new industry website, which was launched by the Association of Train Operating Companies on 24 August.

There are currently many ticket offices open for very long hours, while selling very few tickets indeed. In an era where passengers are telling us that they need fares to come down and investment in services to rise, these sorts of costs simply cannot be justified.

These changes will provide savings to taxpayers and passengers far beyond the life of the existing franchise, and will ultimately save millions of pounds. I believe that this is a necessary step in improving the efficiency of the rail network, and reducing the cost of rail travel for everyone.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/baker-20120918a,180,"**The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Norman Baker)**: Earlier this year we launched a consultation paper setting out options for how we should devolve funding and prioritisation of local major transport schemes following this Spending Review period.

Transport is vitally important to local economies, and new infrastructure can provide the missing links that are often so crucial in getting economies moving and creating opportunities for new investment and employment.

We want to ensure that decisions on new transport infrastructure are made more efficiently, and at a more local level than previously. Local Enterprise Partnerships are well placed to understand how transport investment can be used to boost economic recovery and growth and that is why we want them, working with Local Authorities, to have a key role. Indeed more Government funding was announced yesterday for Local Enterprise Partnerships to boost their ability to contribute to the growth and jobs agenda.

I am pleased to say that our consultation proposals were met with approval from the majority of respondents, particularly Local Authorities and Local Enterprise Partnerships. A summary of the responses received was published in July. I have today published firm proposals, confirming that, in all of the key areas, the Department will proceed on the basis as set out in the consultation paper.

I fully support the key objective of removing Whitehall from the process of making decisions on which local schemes should or should not go ahead. However we have a responsibility to ensure that the new local decision makers have arrangements in place to achieve the value for money that we know the right schemes can deliver and to take account of other important factors such as environmental impact. Most respondents accepted the need for robust local assurance frameworks and we will shortly publish detailed guidance on this, to enable local areas to submit their draft frameworks by December.

Transparency is also essential, to ensure that priorities are widely publicised and understood and can be effectively shaped by local people that have a key interest in them. Evaluation will also assume an even greater importance, to enable all parties to look critically at whether key outcomes were achieved and to learn lessons for future investment decisions.

We have asked local areas to confirm the geographical basis for their local transport bodies by 28 September. When they have done so I will set out indicative funding levels that each area should use as a planning assumption. I can confirm that the distribution of funding between different areas will be on a simple per-capita basis. The total level of funding available will of course be subject to decisions made in future spending rounds.

I look forward to working with local transport bodies over the coming months as we embark on this transition to a truly decentralised system and they begin developing their infrastructure plans for post 2015.

The decision to proceed took account of a range of evidence including analysis by my Department and High Speed Two Ltd of issues raised in consultation as well as comments from a wide variety of interested parties through a range of engagement approaches. The Government's independent response analysis consultants, Dialogue by Design (DbyD), carried out a detailed analysis of the consultation responses and a summary of their analysis was published alongside the Government's January decision, with an addendum report published in July:

  * High Speed Rail: [Investing in Britain's Future - Consultation Summary Report](/publications/hs2-consultation-summary/)
  * High Speed Rail: [Investing in Britain's Future - Addendum](/publications/high-speed-rail-addendum/)

Since publishing the Addendum report in July, it has become apparent that a further very small proportion of responses were not fully analysed by DbyD. For these responses, the answers to one or more of the seven consultation questions were omitted from DbyD's analysis. In total, approximately 0.4% of answers provided to individual consultation questions were affected.

The table below shows how many of the seven consultation answers were omitted from the analysis in each case:

The cause has been identified as technical errors in transferring data captured from online consultation responses to the consultation analysis database held by DbyD.

My Department asked for supplementary analysis from DbyD and this work concludes that the responses 'do not provide any information that was not already included in the previous Consultation Summary Report or would have made a difference to the substantive content or balance of that report'. Inclusion in the original analysis would not have changed the substance of DbyD's findings, nor affected the considerations which informed the decisions following the consultation.

All those who submitted the responses affected will be contacted with details of their particular cases.

This interim response is considering only option 1 of the consultation. The remaining options and consultation responses will be considered and a full response, including proposals for a way forward, will be published by the end of November.  
The foundation of all three of the main policy options is a speeding up of the process by allowing stopping up and planning applications to run concurrently, namely option 1.

The large majority of respondents, comprising three main groups, namely developers, local authorities and those affected by stopping up decisions, gave broad support for allowing stopping up and planning applications to be made concurrently, with agreement that it would speed up the process and reduce burdens. We will seek an early legislative opportunity to implement this change.

The Government committed to improving the stopping up application process in the 2011 Autumn Statement and this will help to deliver the Government's growth agenda, by removing unnecessary burdens faced by businesses, speeding up the application process and removing unnecessary bureaucracy. The change will play a useful role in encouraging investment and therefore growth in local communities.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/hammond-20121023a,183,"**The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Mr Stephen Hammond)**: For the benefit of Members of the House, I am today setting out some details of the HGV Road User Levy Bill which will be debated in the House of Commons on Tuesday 23rd October. The Bill itself will be walked in after the debate on the Ways and Means resolution.

The HGV Road User Levy Bill with introduce charges for all HGVs that weigh 12 tonnes and over for using the UK road network.

The Government realises the importance of haulage services provided by both UK-registered and foreign-registered vehicles to our economy, ensuring that goods are brought in and efficiently moved around the country. The key aim of this Bill is to ensure a fairer arrangement for UK-hauliers to help improve their competitiveness.

The legislation being introduced fulfils a commitment in the Coalition Agreement and is designed to remove an inequality, whereby UK hauliers pay to use many roads abroad, but foreign-hauliers do not pay to use roads in the UK. The levy is designed to be cost neutral for UK hauliers, through offsetting reductions in Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) payments. Changes to VED will be included in the Finance Bill 2014.

The levy will be time based and will vary according to the vehicle type, weight and number of axles. This seeks to ensure that the charging scale is linked to the amount of damage a HGV causes to a road. The levy will be a maximum of £1,000 per year or £10 per day for the largest vehicles.

UK-registered HGVs will pay the levy for either a six-monthly or annual period. Foreign-registered vehicles can pay the levy either daily, weekly, monthly or annually. Rebates will be available under certain circumstances. Revenues will be paid into the Consolidated Fund.

The Bill makes it an offence to fail to pay the levy and, on summary conviction, a fine of up to level 5 on the standard scale (currently £5,000) will be payable. The Bill also provides for the offence to be subject to a fixed penalty and it allows the Secretary of State to refuse to issue a vehicle licence if he is not satisfied that the appropriate levy has been paid.

The scheme will be administered by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) or the Driver and Vehicle Agency (DVA) in Northern Ireland. A private company will be contracted by the Department for Transport to administer the payment scheme for foreign-registered HGVs. The contractor will be required to maintain an electronic database of foreign-registered HGVs for which a levy has been paid. UK enforcement agencies will have access to the database.

The scheme will be enforced by the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) in Great Britain and the Driver and Vehicle Agency (DVA) in Northern Ireland. These agencies currently enforce UK and foreign hauliers' compliance with regulations on vehicle roadworthiness, drivers' hours and other road safety regulations. The Police also have enforcement powers.

The Department for Transport conducted a consultation exercise in early 2012, and the findings of this are also being published today, and will be available on the [Department for Transport's website](http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/dft-2012-03).

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/hammond-20121030a,184,"The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Mr Stephen Hammond): I am today correcting the answer to a question that I provided during the Ways and Means Resolution debate on the HGV Road User Levy Bill, on Tuesday 23rd October 2012.

In response to the question asked by Bob Stewart (Beckenham) (Con) on ""whether vehicles leaving a port of entry will have a physical sign on their windows indicating that they have paid"" [Official Report, 23 October 2012, Col 881], I should have clearly stated that there will be no physical sign of payment, through the display of a paper disc, sticker or similar item.

Payment of the levy will be recorded in a database using the vehicle registration as the unique identifier. We expect that enforcement of non payment will be carried out using Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) technology equipped cameras linked to this payment database, which will allow VOSA to target and stop non-compliant vehicles. We expect that checks on vehicles will be made shortly after the HGVs have left the port at which they have arrived, and are on the UK road network. Further checks will be carried out in other locations. Non-compliant vehicles will need to pay a penalty of £200 before they are allowed to proceed. Cases that are taken to court will be liable to a fine of up to £5,000.

The use of a physical indication of payment is impractical, as drivers could have to physically change stickers or discs daily, and it would create an enormous and costly burden, in terms of administration of the charge. It could also create problems if relied on for enforcement, as stickers or discs could be forged.

The Department for Transport's consultation on this subject was also based on a database linked enforcement method.

I immediately ordered two independent investigations to be undertaken urgently.

The second review, led by Richard Brown, Chairman of Eurostar, is focussing on any lessons to be learned for the upcoming franchising programme.

I also announced, that the ongoing franchising programme should be paused, pending the outcome of the two investigations. This included pausing the live competitions on Essex Thameside, Great Western and Thameslink.

This morning at 7am, I have made a further announcement to the London Stock Exchange, that the Department for Transport is commencing negotiations with Virgin Rail Group with a view to them remaining as operator of passenger services for the West Coast Main Line for a short period, of around 9 to 13 months while we run a competition for an interim franchise agreement. This interim agreement, which would be open to any bidders, will then run until a new long term West Coast franchise is ready to commence.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/mcloughlin-20121015b,186,"Mr Speaker, with permission I would like to make a statement on the West Coast Main Line.

On Wednesday 3rd October I announced the cancellation of the InterCity West Coast franchise procurement.

This decision was taken as the result of significant flaws found within the procurement process undertaken by my Department.

These made the continuation of the competition and the award of the franchise untenable.

I know how important the West Coast Main Line is to the economy of this country and to the constituents of Members.

This franchise operates over 300 train services a day, carries over 26 million passengers a year and employs more than 3000 staff.

Mr Speaker, this is a regrettable outcome caused by unacceptable mistakes made by officials in my Department during a complex procurement process.

It has also meant that I have paused the ongoing franchising programme, including live competitions on Essex Thameside, Great Western, and Thameslink.

I would like to reiterate that there is no suggestion that First Group or any of the other bidders including Virgin Trains acted in anything other than good faith during the bidding process.

First Group is a great British company and a leading transport operator both here and in the United States.

It provides jobs for 13,000 people across the UK and operates four railway franchises, which together carry over 300 million passengers a year.

I want to make it clear today that the cancellation of the West Coast competition should not be seen as a comment on FirstGroup, its bid, or its approach to running rail franchises now or in the future.

Furthermore, as I have said to the Transport Select Committee, Virgin has also made a fantastic contribution to both the railways and aviation in this country.

It would be premature at this stage to speculate on where and how the errors in the process emerged.

That is why, when I announced the cancellation of the procurement, I also asked for two urgent investigations to be carried out.

Both reviews are now well underway.

The first of these is an inquiry led by Sam Laidlaw, the Chief Executive of Centrica. He is the lead non-executive director on procurement across Government and the lead non-executive director of the Departmental board. 

His review is examining what happened during the West Coast procurement and why. It will establish the lessons to be learned.

I have asked for the initial findings of the review by the end of October and expect the full report by the end of November.

The second review is looking at the implications of the flaws on the West Coast procurement for the rest of the franchising programme.

This review is being led by Richard Brown, a highly-respected industry figure and the Chairman of Eurostar.

My expectation is that the Brown review will report no later than the end of the year on lessons for the future franchising programme - so that it can be resumed as soon as possible.

Mr Speaker, I am today publishing the terms of reference for both reviews, and these have already been laid in the Library of the House.

Before these reviews have been completed, and particularly before the findings of the Laidlaw review have been published, any speculation as to the nature of the flaws is just that - speculation.

I will of course report to the House on the findings of these reviews at the earliest opportunity.

However, I would like to take this opportunity to restate the Government's commitment to ensuring that we continue to have private sector innovation and investment in the railways.

Since privatisation, the number of passenger miles travelled has nearly doubled.

This growth brings significant benefits to the country's economy and to the environment, relieving congestion, improving connectivity for businesses, commuters and leisure travellers.

Passenger satisfaction is up. So is punctuality.

I want to see these benefits continue. That is why I want this pause while the reviews are carried out to be as short as possible.

We will restart our refranchising programme - including the competitions on Essex Thameside, Great Western, and Thameslink as soon as possible.

Mr Speaker, I would now like to turn to the future operation of the West Coast Main Line.

I am committed to ensuring that passengers will see no impact as a result of these mistakes.

Passengers will be able to make the journeys they have planned, with the tickets they have bought.

Clearly we will need to learn lessons from the two reviews. And we will need to run a new competition for the West Coast franchise.

I want this to happen as quickly as possible, but we want to get it right which will take time.

It is also important that in the intervening period we secure a deal which secures best value for the taxpayer, including, continuing improvement in service quality.

For this reason, I am today announcing that we are commencing negotiations with Virgin Rail Group with a view to them remaining as operator of passenger services for the West Coast Main Line.

Subject to ensuring value for money for the taxpayer, I expect this to last for a short period of around 9 to 13 months.

In this period we will run a competition for an interim agreement. This interim agreement, which would be open to any bidders, will then run until the new long-term West Coast franchise is ready to commence.

I will keep this approach under review so it can be informed by Richard Brown's findings and recommendations, and so it ensures value for money.

Mr Speaker, I am grateful to the team at Directly Operated Railways for all their preparation so far. Directly Operated Railways will continue to stand ready should they be required.

Britain's railways are a great success and I am determined that this incident does not get in the way of this Government's real record.

We have launched the biggest programme of investment since the Victorian era. We have also just announced reductions in regulated fares rises over the next two years, recognising the importance of access to the railways for millions of commuters.

And we are pressing ahead with the most ambitious and visionary infrastructure agenda in recent years - most notably in pursuing the transformative programme for High Speed 2.

I commend this statement to the House.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/mcloughlin-20121025a,187,"In January the government announced that we would proceed with plans to build a high speed rail network linking London with Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester. High Speed Two (HS2) will have a transformative effect on Britain, bringing cities closer together and providing the new transport capacity we need to meet the challenges of the 21st century.

We need to drive forward with this vital national project. In doing so we need to provide support for those facing the disruption that the plans for the railway are causing, while also protecting the interests of tax-payers who will ultimately pay for compensation. We have been clear throughout that we are committed to providing appropriate compensation and assistance for those affected by the building of HS2.

The statutory system of compensation already provides fair compensation for the vast majority of infrastructure schemes. However, given the particular circumstances of HS2, in this case I believe it is right to go above and beyond what is required by law. Today I am launching a generous proposed compensation and support package for public consultation.

Under the proposals set out today all those living closest to the route of HS2, in the so-called 'safeguarded area', will be able to choose to sell their home to the government - whether it is required for construction or not - at any time after the HS2 route is safeguarded, which is currently expected to happen in Spring 2013. Those choosing to sell their homes will receive its full un-blighted value (that is, what the property would have been worth had there been no plans for HS2), a home loss payment of 10% of the value of the property (up to a maximum of £47,000) and be reimbursed for reasonable moving costs, including stamp duty on the purchase of a new property of equivalent value.

In rural areas we will establish a 'voluntary purchase zone', extending out from the boundary of the safeguarded area up to 120m either side of the line, within which homeowners will have the option to sell their homes to the government at their full unblighted value at any time after the HS2 route is safeguarded.

For those living beyond both the safeguarded area and voluntary purchase zone but who need to move house during the development of HS2 and find they are unable to sell their property, there will also be a 'long term hardship scheme' under which the government will buy the homes of successful applicants at their full unblighted value.

In addition, under the new 'sale and rent' back scheme, homeowners whose property will need to be acquired will have the option to sell their homes to the government early and stay in them as tenants until the properties are required for the railway.

We recognise that the owners of properties above tunnels may also be concerned about the potential impact of HS2 and therefore we are bringing in a series of measures designed to provide confidence in these properties.

Finally, we will work with local authorities, housing associations and affected tenants to agree a joint strategy to replace any social housing which is lost.

I must stress that we have already written directly to all those whose homes we currently expect to need to buy in order to build and operate HS2 on the London - West Midlands route. The wide-ranging proposals set out today reflect the significant nature of the concern that currently exists in the property markets near the HS2 line of route, they are not a reflection of what the government believes the long term impacts of HS2 will be. We fully expect that the impacts of HS2 will be considerably less than feared and that property prices will recover over time. However, we recognise that the current property markets near the HS2 line of route may not reflect this.

HS2 will be the backbone of a new transport system for the 21st century, offering the new railway capacity that our country will need to compete and grow. However, we fully recognise that the line will have unwelcome impacts on people living close to the route and I believe that this package of compensation demonstrates the strength of the government's commitment to provide the right compensation and assistance to those affected.

Alongside the property consultation published today, we are also publishing a consultation on safeguarding directions for HS2. This will set out the proposed area of land considered necessary to protect the line of route from conflicting developments, that is to say planning permission being granted for developments on land that will be required for the construction or operation of HS2. This will also set the 'safeguarded area' within which compensation measures will apply.

Both consultations will close on 31st January 2013.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/mcloughlin-20121025b,188,"**The Secretary of State for Transport (Patrick McLoughlin):** I will attend the first Transport Council of the Cypriot Presidency (the Presidency) in Luxembourg on Monday 29 October.

The Presidency hopes to achieve General Approach on three proposals:

  * The first is a proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on common rules for the allocation of slots, repealing Council Directive 95/93/EC. The proposed regulation has been subject to intense official-level scrutiny by Council Working Groups and these discussions are ongoing. Progress to date has been mixed, but the proposition remains acceptable from a UK perspective. I believe that the resulting regulation could help promote the most effective use of airport slots and build on the existing transparent, market-based approach to encourage the more efficient use of scarce capacity at congested airports, while minimising administrative and financial burdens for industry. However, at this stage, it remains unclear whether or not it will be possible to seek a General Approach at the October Council.
  * The second is a proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the enforcement of certain provisions of the Maritime Labour Convention by flag States. The proposed General Approach represents a satisfactory outcome for the UK and I will support it as it allows appropriate flexibility to Member States, and will not require the UK to make any substantive changes to its proposed implementation of the provisions of the Maritime Labour Convention on flag State responsibilities.
  * The third is a proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2009/16/EC on port State control. I will support the proposal which will not require the UK to make any substantive changes to its proposed implementation of the provisions of the Maritime Labour Convention on port State responsibilities.

An orientation debate will be held on a proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on roadworthiness testing for motor vehicles and their trailers (First Reading). The UK strongly supports the ongoing roadworthiness testing of vehicles as a worthwhile contribution to road safety.

However, the UK is very concerned by the potential cost burden of the European Commission's proposal as it is currently framed. The UK alone has identified costs of over €1 billion without any discernable benefit in road safety. We have also identified significant administrative burdens embedded in the proposal that similarly would produce no road safety benefit. In the current economic climate the UK does not wish to see any additional cost to European citizens, businesses or governments unless clearly justified by road safety benefits.

The Presidency will be seeking a Political Agreement on the proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 3821/85 on recording equipment in road transport and amending Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 of the European Parliament and the Council (First Reading). The UK supports the proposal which strikes a sensible balance between improving the security of the tachograph whilst ensuring that additional burdens on industry and enforcement authorities are minimised.

The Council will be expected to adopt a proposal for a Council decision on the signing, on behalf of the European Union, and provisional application of the Agreement providing a general framework for enhanced cooperation between the European Union and the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation (Eurocontrol). The UK supports the proposed Agreement. It is important that the significant work Eurocontrol performs on behalf of the European Union is put on a sound contractual and financial basis to help ensure value for money from the proposed €40 million expenditure over four years.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/mcloughlin-20121029a,189,"Mr Speaker, with permission I would like to make a statement on the progress we are making to put right arrangements for the West Coast Main Line and rail franchising.

First, I will update the House on the Laidlaw Inquiry.

Second, I will explain how we will ensure not only continuity of service on the West Coast line after December 9th but an enhanced service.

On the 3rd of October I announced the cancellation of the competition to run the Inter-City West Coast franchise…

…because of the discovery of unacceptable flaws in the procurement process run by the Department for Transport.

I made it clear at the time, and do so again today, that this was a very regrettable decision prompted by mistakes that should never have happened.

I also launched two independent inquiries, one of which has reported its [interim findings](http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/laidlaw-inquiry-interim-report) to me and which I am today delivering to the House.

I asked the first inquiry, led by Centrica chief executive Sam Laidlaw, to look into what happened and why…

…with the aim of establishing the lessons to be learned.

I also asked the second review, led by Eurostar chairman Richard Brown, to focus on any lessons to be learned for the future rail franchising programme.

I promised that both would conduct their investigations thoroughly, independently and urgently.

Mr Speaker, given the public interest in this matter the Laidlaw Inquiry was asked to deliver an interim report to me by the 26th October, and a final report by the end of November.

I am grateful to the Inquiry for meeting this first deadline, and working tirelessly to meet the second.

I stress that today's findings are precisely that - an interim report. There is more work to do. These findings are clearly a first stage.

As Mr Laidlaw explains, they set out what went wrong, and from that basis he will now carry out further investigations into why this happened.

From the start, my aim in dealing with this situation has been to be open, and come forward with information for the House at the earliest opportunity.

It is in that spirit that I make this statement today.

In the interests of complete transparency, I am publishing this interim report, with its provisional findings, and placing copies of it in the Libraries of both Houses.

To be blunt, these initial findings make uncomfortable reading but they provide a necessary and welcome further step in sorting this out.

The Government will need to see the full and finished report before it can comment in detail on any conclusions.

This is crucial because of the independent nature of the Laidlaw Inquiry and the need for the Government not to pre-judge its eventual findings.

But it is clear that the Inquiry has identified a number of issues which confirm that my decision to cancel the franchise competition was necessary.

These include…

…a lack of transparency in the bidding process…

…the fact that published guidance was not complied with when bids were being processed…

…inconsistencies in the treatment of bidders…

…and confirmation of technical flaws in the model used to calculate the amount of risk capital bidders were asked to provide to guard against the risk of default.

The Laidlaw Inquiry also mentions factors ""that appear to have caused or contributed to the issues raised"".

We will look at these with interest and care, although once again we will need to see the final report before we can comment further.

Secondly, I would like to update the House on the progress we are making to ensure continuity of service on the West Coast Main Line once the current franchise expires on the 9th of December.

As I have said previously, we will ensure that passengers continue to be served by the same trains, with the same frontline staff, the same services, using the same tickets…

…and, I am pleased to say, enhanced future timetables.

The Department is making good progress in its discussions with Virgin on how they will operate the line for a short period of up to 14 months while a competition is run for an interim agreement.

We are discussing their proposals for improved services over this period and an enhanced compensation scheme for delayed passengers.

In dealing with this, my Department has been frank and open about its mistakes and is absolutely determined to find out exactly what happened.

In the meantime, we will keep delivering for passengers and continue with the unprecedented levels of investment in trains, stations and railway lines.

Combined with our decision to limit train fare rises to an average of inflation plus one per cent, instead of RPI+3, for the next three years…

…this demonstrates this government's total commitment to Britain's railways.

I commend this statement to the House.
