http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20101125,"More than 2,100 new carriages for rail travellers as Government unveils rail investment package","The Government will invest in more than 2,100 new rail carriages for Britain's railways by 2019, Transport Secretary Philip Hammond announced today as he unveiled plans to modernise the rail network, tackle overcrowding, improve reliability and speed up journeys.

Mr Hammond confirmed that London's Thameslink project will go ahead in its entirety at a total capital cost of around £6bn, as will £900m of rail electrification projects on lines between London and Didcot, Newbury and Oxford as well as between Liverpool, Manchester, Preston and Blackpool. In addition to the 2,100 new carriages, Britain is also to get a new fleet of intercity trains, replacing the ageing 30 year old 'Intercity 125s' on the Great Western and East Coast main lines, the Transport Secretary announced.

Transport Secretary Philip Hammond said:

""At a time of severe pressure on public spending, it would be tempting to cut back on investment in our railways. But we cannot afford not to invest in Britain's future.

""We have already committed to the Crossrail project and to £14bn to support capital maintenance and investment in our railways over the next four years. Today I can confirm that the Thameslink project will go ahead in its entirety and I can announce 650 further carriages to reduce overcrowding. In total this amounts to 2,100 new carriages which will help make our railways fit for the 21st century.""

In total the Government will deliver more than 2,100 new rail carriages onto the network by May 2019. Of these, 1,800 will be for new Crossrail and Thameslink services. This will in turn free up hundreds of existing electric carriages to be deployed onto the newly electrified lines by franchised train operators. In total, there will be at least 1,850 net additional carriages on the network by 2019. The Government will now enter into commercial negotiations with the franchised operators about the allocation of the unallocated element of 650 further carriages for delivery before 2014. Subject to those negotiations, the Government expects additional carriages to be added on services into Leeds, Manchester, Sheffield, Liverpool, Newcastle, Birmingham, Bristol, London Paddington and London Waterloo.

The Thameslink project will virtually double the number of north-south trains running through central London during the busiest times and provides new links between towns and cities north and south of the capital without the need to change trains in London. The programme includes the rebuilding of three major London stations, including London Bridge. The Thameslink Programme will be reprofiled, enabling Network Rail to deliver the works in a more efficient manner, improving the scheme's value for money and reducing potential risks. Passengers will, however, benefit from incremental improvements as work on the project continues to advance.

Electrification of the railway lines between London and Reading, Didcot, Newbury and Oxford, as well as between Liverpool, Manchester, Preston and Blackpool will allow the current diesel trains to be replaced with electric vehicles. Electric trains are cleaner, quieter and more reliable than diesels as well as providing more seats. They are also cheaper to buy, operate and maintain. The Government supports further electrification of the rail network and will continue to consider the case for further electrification schemes, including on the Midland Main Line.

Most of Britain's ageing Intercity 125 'high speed trains' are to be retired, Mr Hammond also announced. Plans to introduce a new generation of trains through the 'Intercity Express Programme' (IEP) have been under review by the Government since February. The Government has now ruled out simply refurbishing the existing trains and has also ruled out requiring passengers to interchange from electric to diesel trains at stations where electric lines end. Two alternative options remain under consideration: a revised and lower cost IEP bid from Agility Trains (Hitachi and John Laing), which envisages a mixture of electric trains and 'hybrid' trains with both electric and diesel engines; and a new proposal for a fleet of new all-electric trains which could be coupled to new diesel locomotives where the overhead electric power lines end. The Government will be in a position to make an announcement on further electrification of the Great Western Main Line once this review is complete.

##  Notes to editors 

### 2100 new carriages

  * The 2,100 new carriages includes vehicles for the Thameslink and Crossrail projects as well as extra carriages to be delivered by franchised train operators.
  * Although franchised train operators are free to introduce extra carriages at any time at their own expense, there are no contractual obligations on train operators to introduce additional carriages where there is crowding. Therefore, if the train operator does not feel it can recover the additional costs of running the extra carriages from passenger revenues they are unlikely to introduce additional carriages.
  * This is why the Government is intervening. The Government will now enter into commercial negotiations with train operators over the costs of running the additional carriages and therefore cannot publish exact numbers of carriages for each route at this time.

### Thameslink

  * The Thameslink Programme will make travelling across London and the south east easier and quicker. It will reduce crowding on some of the busiest sections of London's transport network and introduce a new generation of electric commuter trains, carrying up to 1750 passengers. 
  * The first stage of the Thameslink Programme is already under construction. Building work is already well underway at Farringdon and Blackfriars stations, and platform extension work has been completed at many locations including Luton Airport Parkway and St Albans. This first stage will enable some longer 12 carriage trains to operate on the Bedford to Brighton route from December 2011.
  * The second stage involves the reconstruction of London Bridge station and its approaches and a new connection to the East Coast Main Line just to the north of St Pancras. This stage will deliver 24 trains per hour in both directions through the central London core section, as well as longer 12 carriage operation to a range of destinations to the north and south of London from 
  * The new trains required for the Programme will require an order of around 1,200 new carriages. Two bidders, Bombardier and Siemens, remain in the competition. A preferred bidder is expected to be announced in spring 2011.
  * The capital cost for the new infrastructure and the new rolling stock is estimated to cost around £6 billion. Previously a range of £5.5bn to £6bn was given as further development of the project was required before a firmer figure could be provided. The next phase of development work for both infrastructure and rolling stock has now been completed therefore enabling a more definite view of expected cost.

### Electrification

  * On the Great Western Main Line, the Government is confirming today that the lines between London and Didcot, Oxford and Newbury will be electrified. In the North West, the routes between Liverpool, Manchester, Preston and Blackpool will be electrified. In more detail, that will include: 
    * Liverpool to Manchester via Newton-le-Willows
    * Huyton to Wigan
    * Preston to Blackpool
    * Manchester to Preston
  * The Great Western electrification is expected to cost up to £600 million, and the package of electrification in the North West will cost up to £300 million.
  * Electrification to Didcot, Oxford and Newbury is expected to be completed by 2016. Electrification between Manchester and the West Coast Main Line is expected to be completed by the end of 2013, allowing electric trains to run on the Manchester - Scotland route with the other lines in the North West following in sequence by 2016.

### Intercity Express Programme

  * The DfT has been considering the question of new intercity rolling stock to replace the existing Intercity 125s for some time. In February 2009 the Agility Trains consortium was identified by the Government as preferred bidder to build a new fleet of intercity trains. In February 2009 the Government invited Sir Andrew Foster, former head of the Audit Commission, to provide an independent assessment of the value for money of the programme. Sir Andrew presented his report to DfT in June 2010 recommending further study of both the Agility Trains proposal and the alternatives.
  * Following today's announcement, two options remain under consideration: 
    * Agility Trains' revised bid, for a mixed fleet of some all-electric trains, and some electric trains which are also equipped with underfloor diesel generators.
  * A proposal for a fleet of new all-electric trains which could be coupled to new diesel locomotives where the overhead electric power lines end.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20111206a,Change in UK policy on employing armed guards to protect against Somali piracy,"UK-registered vessels will be able to employ armed guards to defend themselves against pirates in exceptional circumstances under new guidance confirmed by the Government today.

The move comes after a significant increase in the number of attacks against vessels in the Indian Ocean and Gulf of Aden in recent years.  Evidence shows that vessels with armed guards are less likely to be successfully attacked, which is why the Government has been working in recent months to allow the lawful use of armed guards in exceptional circumstances.

The guidance published today includes the factors ship owners should include in a risk assessment and advice on selecting a private security company (PSC).  Shipping companies wishing to use armed guards will also be required to submit a detailed counter-piracy plan to the Department for Transport in advance.

Shipping Minister Mike Penning said:

> ""The word 'pirate' can conjure up cartoonish images of eye patches, parrots and wooden legs, but the reality is much more serious.  Modern pirates are dangerous, organised criminals who have shown they are not shy of using violence to achieve their goals.  We have not taken this decision lightly. It is clear that we must offer those flying the Red Ensign every opportunity to ensure the safety of their crews and vessels.""
> 
> ""By allowing the use of armed guards in a structured, legal framework we can move to a system where ship owners can provide an adequate deterrent against this scourge on the maritime industry.""

Under the changes published today, any PSC employed to put armed guards onboard UK ships will require authorisation from the Home Office for the possession of prohibited firearms.  The Home Office and police will also carry out checks into the PSC and its personnel before an authorisation is granted.

The guidance published today will be kept under review to ensure it reflects continuing work being done at both a national and international level to counter the increase in piracy around the world.

## Notes to Editors

  1. The guidance to the UK shipping industry on the use of armed guards on vessels is available on the [Department for Transport website](http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/use-of-armed-guards-to-defend-against-piracy):
  2. The exact circumstances under which the use of armed guards could be permitted are:
  3. when the ship is transiting the high seas throughout the High Risk Area (an area bounded by Suez and the Straights of Hormuz to the North, 10°S and 78°E); AND
  4. the latest ""Best Management Practices"" is being followed fully but, on its own, is not deemed by the shipping company and the ship's master as sufficient to protect against acts of piracy; AND
  5. the use of armed guards is assessed to reduce the risk to the lives and well being of those onboard the ship.
  6. In the last four years, 64 people have lost their lives as a consequence of Somali piracy.  Currently 12 vessels and over 240 hostages are in the control of pirates off the Somali coast.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20120109,Transport Secretary visits Gatwick to see Olympic preparations,"Transport Secretary Justine Greening visited Gatwick today to see how the airport intends to play its part during this year's Olympic and Paralympic Games and the wider legacy benefits of the Games in West Sussex.

Justine Greening said:

> ""Our airports will play a key part in the success of London 2012, providing for many the first impression of the country.
> 
> ""I welcome Gatwick's commitment to invest £1 billion on improving facilities which will benefit visitors to the Games, but will also be something that passengers and travellers to the UK can benefit from for many years to come.
> 
> ""The Olympics can be a real boost to jobs, businesses and tourism and I am determined that transport will play a full part.""

This morning, Justine Greening attended a Cabinet meeting on the Olympic Park in Stratford, East London, chaired by the Prime Minister David Cameron. The meeting focused on how every part of the UK can take full advantage of the Olympic and Paralympic Games and the unique chance that the country has to sell itself to a massive international audience.

This afternoon, Cabinet Ministers are visiting towns and cities across the UK to see for themselves how businesses, sports facilities, schools and organisations are benefiting from the Olympic and Paralympic Games.

With little over seven months before the opening ceremony, the construction phase is 95% complete and the project continues to be on time and on budget. Since work began on the East London site in 2008, £6.39billion worth of contracts have been awarded to over 1500 business in the UK.

Prime Minister David Cameron said:

> ""As we kick off 2012, the year of the Olympic and Paralympic Games and the Diamond Jubilee, this is the perfect time for the Cabinet to come together and ensure we are doing absolutely everything we can to make the most of this unique opportunity to showcase all the great things the UK has to offer to the rest of the world.
> 
> ""As Ministers visit Olympic venues, businesses, schools and organisations associated with 2012 right across the UK, I want the message to go out loud and clear, from tourism to business, sport to investment, we are determined to maximise the benefits of 2012 for the whole country.
> 
> ""Today, as we mark 200 days to go, and 6 out of the 8 Olympic venues having already secured their future, we are well on track to delivering a lasting legacy for the whole of Britain.""

## Boosting tourism numbers

Hosting the Games this summer will put the United Kingdom in the international spotlight and the Government is committed to ensuring that the tourism sector maximises the benefits, boosting investment, jobs and growth. Domestic tourism will benefit from a 20.12 per cent discount initiative recently announced by Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt and during a trip to New York last September the Prime Minister launched the GREAT campaign which will focus on promoting globally everything the UK has to offer. The campaign will showcase the opportunities to invest in the UK and help to attract millions of extra visitors.

Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport, Jeremy Hunt said;

> ""London 2012 gives us an opportunity to showcase the best of Britain to the world and what this country has to offer. From our beautiful countryside to historic sites, sporting venues to our amazing cultural offer Britain really does have something for everyone.
> 
> ""I am confident that we will put on a sporting spectacular this summer with some magical, medal moments that we will never forget and that will inspire many young people to get involved in sport.""

Sports in the UK will also receive a boost as part of the Olympic legacy with many of the world-class venues being opened up to local communities and initiatives to support sport in schools, communities and elite athletes continuing after the Games.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20120621a,Passengers views sought on rail franchise for Kent,"Passengers across South East London and Kent are being asked for their views to help shape a new franchise for train services across the area.

The [consultation](/consultations/dft-2012-29/) launched by Rail Minister Theresa Villiers today gives local communities served by the franchise a chance to say what improvements to train services they would like to see. It also asks for the views of potential bidders on how they will improve service quality for passengers.

Theresa Villiers said:

> ""Before we let this franchise, we want to make sure we make the right decisions to maximise the benefits passengers get from it.
> 
> ""This consultation sets out a range of standards we expect any new operator to deliver as a matter of course, including improvements to stations, rolling out smart ticketing technology, better passenger information and good levels of punctuality. But we also want passengers and anyone else with an interest in the railways to tell us about other ways services could be improved.""

The new South Eastern franchise is due to start in April 2014 and run until September 2020 with a possible extension by up to two years. The consultation commences on 21 June 2012 and closes on 13 September 2012.

## Notes to Editors

  1. The new South Eastern franchise is planned to commence on 1 April 2014. The new franchisee will need to manage a period of change to facilitate the delivery of the Thameslink Programme, including dealing with the consequences of the rebuilding of London Bridge station. The franchisee will also have a role in assisting with the delivery of Crossrail services.
  2. We are proposing to align the new South Eastern franchise to terminate at the same time as the combined Thameslink Southern and Great Northern franchise (which is also being consulted on). This is because of the inter-relationship between services covered by the two franchises and the degree of change which both networks will experience over the next few years. Although this means a shorter South Eastern franchise than we would normally expect grant, this will help us realise the full benefits of the Thameslink Programme and Crossrail. Scheduling this next South Eastern franchise to end shortly after the completion of these two projects will enable the subsequent franchise to be decided in the context of the major changes they will have delivered to public transport in London and the South East
  3. The consultation exercise will help inform what we include in the Invitation to Tender (ITT) which is scheduled to be released in May 2013. The ITT will: 
    * require bidders to set out how they will successfully deliver the challenges in this franchise and integrate services to improve the overall service offered to passengers; and
    * set out a framework of incentives to allow bidders to develop and enhance services where appropriate but also strike the right balance between commercial freedom for the franchise and ensuring that interests of passengers, taxpayers and the economy are suitably protected.
  4. We expect bidders will develop a suitable vision for this franchise. Developing a meaningful vision means that bidders will need to take into account value for money, affordability and the deliverability of their plans to address future

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20120716a,"Investing in rail, investing in jobs and growth","More than £9 billion of growth-boosting railway upgrades across England and Wales - representing faster journey times, more reliable services and capacity for 140,000 extra daily commutes by train - have been announced by Transport Secretary Justine Greening.

The full £9.4bn programme of improvements to the rail network published today will meet the needs of intercity passengers, commuters and freight up to the end of this decade while the Government continues to work on High Speed 2 to deliver rail capacity for the British economy in the decades to come.

This [""High Level Output Specification"" programme](/publications/hlos-2012/) for 2014-2019 will be discussed at today's meeting of the Cabinet which the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister will hold outside London.

Crossrail, Thameslink, and electrification between London and Cardiff, Manchester to Liverpool and Preston, and across the Pennines, are among £5.2bn of projects already committed to during 2014-2019. New schemes totalling £4.2bn unveiled today include:

> ""Upgrades to stations and tracks creating enough capacity around cities for an additional 140,000 daily rail commutes at peak times. In addition to Crossrail and Thameslink, announced previously, today's enhancements - such as the £350m lengthening of platforms at London Waterloo station - will provide capacity for 120,000 more daily commutes in and out of London and 20,100 extra daily commutes across Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester and other cities.
> 
> ""Faster journeys and more train capacity from £240m of improvements along the East Coast Main Line from the North East down through Yorkshire, Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire to London.
> 
> ""The creation of a high-capacity ""electric spine"" running from Yorkshire and the West Midlands to South Coast ports allowing more reliable electric trains to cut journey times and boost capacity for passengers and freight. This comprises: an £800m electrification and upgrade from Sheffield - through Nottingham, Derby and Leicester - to Bedford, completing the full electrification of the Midland Main Line out of London St Pancras; and electrification of the lines from Nuneaton and Bedford to Oxford, Reading, Basingstoke and Southampton.
> 
> ""The landmark decision to take electric rail beyond Cardiff to Swansea, completing the full electrification of the Great Western Main Line out of London Paddington at a total cost of more than £600m, and electrifying the Welsh Valley lines, including Ebbw Vale, Maesteg and the Vale of Glamorgan. These will give two-thirds of the Welsh population access to new fleets of electric trains helping to generate Welsh jobs and growth by slashing journey times and boosting passenger and freight capacity.
> 
> ""Completion in full of the ""Northern Hub"" cluster of rail enhancements with the approval of £322m of outstanding track and capacity upgrades across Manchester city centre, Manchester Airport and across to Liverpool. These are in addition to £477m of Northern Hub schemes already approved across the North of England such as electrification of the North Trans Pennine route between York and Manchester.
> 
> ""A new £500m rail link between the Great Western Main Line and Heathrow allowing direct services to the airport for passengers from the West Country, the Thames Valley and Wales.

The HLOS package will be funded in part from fare rises already announced in 2010 and also from the substantial efficiency savings which projects like electrification will have on the long term operating costs of the railways.

Transport Secretary Justine Greening said: ""Investment on this scale, in every region of the country, shows how this coalition government is focused on delivering an affordable, reliable and faster railway network that drives jobs and growth.

> ""These plans to increase capacity and shorten journey times on intercity, commuter and freight services are, alongside our plans for high speed rail, absolutely key to securing our country's prosperity in the decades ahead.""

The investment was also hailed by the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister and Chancellor of the Exchequer.

Prime Minister David Cameron said:

> ""From Crossrail, high speed rail and now the billions of pounds of investment we are announcing today, this government is committed to taking the long term decisions to deliver growth and jobs.
> 
> ""In what is the biggest modernisation of our railways since the Victorian era this investment will mean faster journeys, more seats, better access to stations, greater freight links and a truly world class rail network.""

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said:

> ""This is the biggest expansion in railways in over 150 years, with more than £9bn of investment across the country.
> 
> ""Whilst we inherited a deficit greater than any in our nation's peacetime history, we knew that we had to give the country the boost it needs, to build great railways and make journeys better for the millions of hard working people who use the train every day.
> 
> ""The 'Electric Spine' will make a significant difference for passengers linking London, the Midlands and Yorkshire in a much more efficient rail line, connecting the South and North more effectively than ever before.
> 
> ""As someone who cares deeply about the environment, the opportunity to dramatically expand rail, a greener form of transport than aviation or road is very exciting indeed. This investment will help people to choose trains over cars, reduce carbon emissions and provide a rail system that is faster, more reliable and greener.""

Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne said:

> ""I am pleased that the Northern Hub will be funded in full as part of the Government's plans, which is a significant boost for the major towns and cities of the North, helping to rebalance the UK economy and enabling growth and regeneration throughout the regions.
> 
> ""This Government is making more funds available to invest in rail projects than at any time since the Victorian era, and shows that the Government is committed to delivering on its promises to support investment in public infrastructure that will support economic growth.""

",Department for Transport,"Rail, Crossrail",2012-07-16,,Press release,More than £9 billion of growth-boosting railway upgrades across England and Wales.
http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20120725a,£4.5 billion investment in new trains creates new jobs,"More than 900 jobs will be created and thousands more secured after Transport Secretary Justine Greening approved a £4.5bn contract to supply Britain with the next generation of intercity trains.

In a major boost to the UK's manufacturing industry, 596 railway carriages will be built at a brand new train factory in the north east of England.

Agility Trains, a consortium made up of Hitachi and John Laing, has been awarded the contract to build and maintain the trains under the Intercity Express Programme (IEP), the project to replace Britain's Intercity 125 trains with new higher capacity modern trains.

Hitachi will assemble an intercity fleet of 92 complete trains at a new purpose-built factory in Newton Aycliffe, County Durham, in the process creating 730 skilled jobs with a further 200 jobs during construction of the factory itself and securing thousands more in the UK supply chain. The company will also locate its European rail research and development capabilities on the site which will further enhance the factory's ability to win rail contracts across Europe.

As well as building the new state-of-the-art assembly facility, Hitachi will construct maintenance depots in Bristol, Swansea, west London and Doncaster, and will upgrade existing maintenance depots throughout Britain.

The announcement comes on the eve of the Global Investment Conference in London where the Government will kick off the largest series of trade and investment events ever held in the UK involving more than 3,000 business leaders, policy-makers and ministers from around the world, and half the companies in the FTSE 100.

Transport Secretary Justine Greening said:

> ""A new train factory is fantastic news for Britain and will be welcomed by everyone who wants to see a thriving UK manufacturing sector. It means 730 new skilled jobs created at the factory, 200 jobs in constructing the plant and thousands of jobs secured in the supply chain.
> 
> ""The decision to build almost 600 new intercity train carriages is great for rail passengers who will experience faster and more comfortable journeys when travelling across Britain on the East Coast and Great Western main lines.
> 
> ""Hitachi is the latest major international company to invest on this scale in Britain and I look forward to this new factory in County Durham following in the footsteps of Nissan's successful car plant in Sunderland. There can also be fewer stronger signs that the UK is the best place in which to invest, and from which to develop new markets, than Hitachi's decision to base its European manufacturing base right here in Britain.""

The IEP train fleet will be comprised of electric and bi-mode trains, some five vehicles long and others nine vehicles. These will be faster accelerating than existing stock, and will offer the potential for more frequent services. The higher train capacity will mean more seats and less crowding between Britain's major cities. The modern vehicles will offer a step-change in passenger comfort through increased carry-on luggage space, electronic seat reservations, and no compromise on leg-room. A performance regime will encourage the trains to run reliably throughout the life of the fleet.

The IEP builds on last week's rail investment announcement of further electrification on the Great Western Main Line between London Paddington and Swansea, and together the new trains and infrastructure will offer the potential for journey time savings of 15 minutes in Swansea to London journeys and 21 minutes in Bristol to London journeys as part of the forthcoming Great Western franchise. Passengers travelling along the East Coast Main Line will also see improvements to their travelling experience, as journeys between London and Newcastle will potentially be reduced by 13 minutes in the forthcoming East Coast franchise.

Construction at the Newton Aycliffe site is expected to begin in 2013 and will be fully operational by 2015. The first IEP trains will enter revenue-earning service on the Great Western Main Line in 2017 and on the East Coast Main Line by 2018.

Tomorrow's Global Investment Conference at the British Business Embassy in Lancaster House, London, will be followed by 17 Global Business Summits to be held throughout the duration of the Games and will be targeted at individual sectors and countries.

## Notes to editors

  1. IEP is the programme to replace Britain's fleet of Intercity 125 High Speed Trains (HSTs) that were originally deployed by British Rail in the 1970s and 1980s.
  2. This announcement signifies financial close for the Great Western elements of IEP, and commercial close for the East Coast elements. The East Coast elements will be financed during 2013.
  3. The eventual service pattern will be the responsibility of the future franchisees, although the first phase of the new trains could operate on the following routes: 
    1. Great Western: London - Cardiff - Swansea, London - Oxford - Worcester - Hereford, London - Gloucester - Cheltenham, London - Bath - Bristol
    2. East Coast: London - Leeds, London - York - Newcastle - Edinburgh - Aberdeen / Inverness
* There are also options for ordering further trains, which could operate on the following routes: 

  1. Great Western: London - Exeter - Penzance
  2. East Coast: Replacement of the newer Intercity 225 electric stock
  3. East Coast: London - Cambridge - Kings Lynn
  4. West Coast: London - Milton Keynes - Northampton
* The contract structure passes the responsibility for constructing depots and maintaining trains to Agility Trains. The Train Operating Company will pay Agility Trains ""Set Availability Payments"" for each train that reports for duty each day and remains reliable during the operational period. The Department is providing a ""Usage Guarantee"" to Agility that a Train Operating Company will be in place to make use of the new trains.
* This is the first time in recent history that a bi-mode train has been earmarked for the UK rail network. Bi-mode trains are common on some mainland European national rail systems. Both the electric and bi-mode versions of these trains will include regenerative braking, a system whereby electricity is re-cycled back through the overhead wires when the driver applies the brakes.
* Introducing the bi-mode option for the Intercity Express Programme is estimated to save around £200 million (net present value) as compared to introducing a fleet of all-electric trains to be coupled to a diesel locomotive beyond the electrified sections of the railway.
* The 125 mph (200kph) trains will reduce overcrowding as they will be longer; the new carriages will be 26m in length as opposed to the 23m in Intercity vehicles currently in UK use. 26m vehicles are standard in mainland Europe. The faster journey times will also allow operators to run more frequent services.

",Department for Transport,"Rail, Rail passenger franchises, Rail value for money",2012-07-25,,Press release,596 railway carriages will be built at a brand new train factory in the north east of England.
http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20120727a,New Great Western franchise to deliver new express trains,"The new 15 year Great Western franchise will see passengers benefit from new express trains, additional capacity, smart card ticketing and passenger satisfaction targets as part of proposals being put forward today by Rail Minister Theresa Villiers.

The number of train services required by the new franchise will be based broadly on the current timetable, rather than the contracted minimum in the existing franchise. The popular Sleeper Service to Penzance will be retained. An extra early, fast train from London to Plymouth will be introduced. This will achieve aspirations for a 'there and back in a day' service to Plymouth from the capital.

Successful extra local services such as those on the Truro to Falmouth, Par to Newquay and the Severn Beach Lines, including those which are locally funded at present, are being added to the base specification of the franchise. This recognises the valuable work and track record of investment made by local stakeholders. Full responsibility for funding these local schemes is expected to pass to the Department for Transport from 2015, securing their future and freeing up local resources for other transport priorities.

Rail Minister Theresa Villiers said:

> ""Passengers using the Great Western Line will benefit from major infrastructure improvements and new rolling stock over the next few years, as a result of the Government's ambitious programme of rail improvements, including extensive electrification.
> 
> ""For the first time on the Great Western franchise, we will be introducing requirements on passenger satisfaction for the train operator to meet which will mean they have to focus strongly on the issues that matter the most to passengers. Extending smart card ticketing across the franchise will provide many more passengers across the West and South West with the kind of convenience Oyster has brought to Londoners. The Sleeper train is being retained, Plymouth gets the new early train from London they asked for and the future of popular extra local services such as the Severn Beach Line and Truro to Falmouth has been secured.
> 
> ""This new franchise will see additional capacity delivered to benefit passengers. A more efficient and flexible franchise will encourage private sector investment, for example in improving stations and investing in rolling stock. It will promote greater efficiency and also enable the train operator to react to more effectively to changing passenger demands.""

The new franchise will run for 15 years from July 2013 to July 2028. It will require broadly the same number of trains to run between end-to-end destinations as is the case today, while giving the new operator greater flexibility with regard to timetabling and calling patterns and, in certain instances, use of connecting trains.

This flexibility will help ensure the line is used in the most efficient way for passengers and potentially allow faster journey times and improved services. It will also encourage private sector investment in the franchise, including stations.

A final decision has not yet been taken on the exact number of through services between Paddington and Penzance. The Invitation to Tender requires the continuation of 9 journey opportunities between London and Penzance each day (in addition to the Sleeper) with at least 6 being provided by through trains. After discussions with local MPs and Cornwall Council, the Government is asking the bidders to explore with stakeholders how rail services in Cornwall might be improved to ensure the right balance between long distance and regional services is achieved. The ITT therefore requires bidders to provide a price for additional through journeys above the minimum and also for a half hourly regional service on the Cornish main line. Decisions on whether these options are affordable and can go ahead will be taken prior to the new franchise being agreed.

A number of other options which could help to further improve local services have been included which potential operators are invited to consider and provide pricing for so that they can be taken forward if a value for money solution is provided and local funding is available.

## Notes to Editors

  * 1. Details published of the new franchise that will begin from 21 July 2013, are set out by the [Department in the Invitation to Tender (ITT)](/publications/great-western-franchise-2013/).
  * 2. The Invitation to Tender follows a consultation designed to give the public and stakeholders a chance to have their say on what they wanted from the new franchise.
  * 3. The proposed Train Service Requirement for the operation of the Great Western franchise represents a change from the rigid timetable specification of the past, while retaining obligations that protect the key outcomes for passengers and taxpayers, such as principal first and last trains and minimum numbers of station stops per week and per day. This marks a significant shift from the micro-management that has prevented operators from maximising capacity and optimising timetables to react to the changing demands of their passengers in the past.
  * 4. The four shortlisted bidders from run the franchise from July 2013 are: 
    * First Great Western Trains Limited (FirstGroup plc);
    * GW Trains Limited (Arriva UK Trains Limited - DB (UK) Investments Limited);
    * NXGW Trains Limited (National Express Group PLC); and
    * Stagecoach Great Western Trains Limited (Stagecoach Group plc).
  * 5. Bids for the franchise are expected to be received in October 2012 and the new operator will be announced in March 2013. The new Great Western franchise will run until July 2028, with an option for the Department to extend for up to 7 reporting periods.
  * 6. When the Government set out its plans on franchise reform, it acknowledged that each franchise contract needs to reflect the different characteristics of the lines and services it covers. Therefore the requirements set out in the Great Western Franchise may not necessarily become standard terms in every subsequent rail franchise.
  * 7. The ITT for the Great Western Franchise follows the current agreed regulated fares policy as set out in the 2011 Comprehensive Spending Review - a rise in 2012 of RPI+1% and RPI+3% for 2013 and 2014, returning to RPI+1% thereafter. Over the long term we are committed to reducing the cost of running the railways and the goal of ending the era of above-inflation fare increases.
  * 8. Local services which are expected to move from local to national funding in 2015 include:

Service Description Funding Body

Bristol TM to Severn Beach (frequency increase)
Bristol City Council

Bristol TM to Severn Beach (Sundays)
South Gloucestershire Council

Truro - Falmouth (all week frequency increase)
Cornwall Council

Exeter - Barnstaple (additional M-F and additional Sundays)
Devon County Council

  * 9. Priced Options: The ITT asks bidders to price the following improvements to services:

**1) Services to Cornwall**
Continued operation of 9 through services. Provision of a half hourly, regular service between Plymouth and Penzance or Exeter, from May 2017 when cascaded rolling stock is anticipated to become available.

**2) TransWilts Rail (Phase 1)**
Additional weekday rail services and reinstatement of Sunday services from Salisbury to Swindon via Melksham

**3) Riviera Line (Exeter to Paignton) strengthening**
Introduction of an additional 1tph service on the Riviera line from Newton Abbot to Paignton

**4) Heart of Wessex Line Service Optimisation**
A much strengthened service on the Heart of Wessex line between Bristol and Weymouth

**5) Bristol Metro Phase 1**
An advanced scheme developed by the West of England Partnership. Phase 1 will provide a half hourly service in the Greater Bristol Metropolitan Area including re-opening of the rail line to Portishead to passenger services

**6) Devon Metro**
Devon Metro follows a similar concept to Bristol Metro for local services into Exeter, from Exmouth, Barnstaple, Newton Abbot and Paignton. It also proposes additional, new services on the SWT route to Axminster and to Okehampton

**7) Cornish Branch Line service enhancements**
St Ives Trains extended to Penzance. Additional summer, Monday-Saturday Looe Valley Services

**8) Tavistock-Bere Alston re-opening**
Re-opening of the rail line from Bere Alston to Tavistock

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20120815a,New operator for West Coast rail passengers,"Rail passengers from London to Scotland will benefit from a package of improvements including more trains and more seats, as Rail Minister Theresa Villiers unveiled First West Coast Limited as the new operator for the 'InterCity West Coast' franchise.

As part of the deal First West Coast Limited will introduce 11 new six-car electric trains which will enable more seats to be provided across the franchise, including greater capacity on the Birmingham to Scotland route. New services are planned from Blackpool, Telford, Shrewsbury and Bolton to London. First West Coast Limited has also committed to cut the cost of its 'Standard Anytime' fares by an average of 15% within the first two years.

The franchise stretches from London to Glasgow, connecting many of the UK's major cities including Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham, Wolverhampton, Edinburgh, Lancaster and Chester. The franchise deal is worth £5.5 billion (net present value) over the lifetime of the contract.

Rail Minister Theresa Villiers said:

> ""This new franchise will deliver big improvements for passengers, with more seats and plans for more services. Targets to meet on passenger satisfaction will be introduced for the first time in an InterCity rail franchise and passengers will also benefit from smart ticketing and from investment in stations.
> 
> ""The West Coast is the first of the new longer franchises to be let by the Coalition which has helped us secure real benefits for passengers by encouraging First West Coast Limited to invest in the future of the service.""

Benefits the new franchise will offer passengers include:

  * **More Seats**: The new 11 six-car electric trains will deliver circa 12,000 extra seats a day, from December 2016 with the cascade of existing rolling stock to bolster capacity on West Coast routes. This is in addition to the 106 extra 'Pendolino' carriages which are currently being introduced into operation on to the franchise, which will deliver over 28,000 extra daily seats.
  * **More Services**: Initially First West Coast Limited will operate the timetable they will inherit from the current franchise but are seeking to introduce a number of new services including a London Euston to Blackpool service from 2013 and from 2016 services from London to Telford Central, Shrewsbury and Bolton.
  * **Improved Services**: Journey time improvements between London and Glasgow are planned, as well as additional services from London to Preston.
  * **Fares**: First West Coast Limited is changing its Standard Anytime fares and reducing them by an average of 15% over the first two years of the franchise.
  * **Improved Stations**: First West Coast Limited is taking over responsibility for maintenance at 17 of their stations and will spend at least £22m on a station investment programme.
  * Smart ticketing technology: First West Coast Limited will introduce ITSO based smart ticketing. This will offer speed and convenience as well as new ticket types more tailored to individual needs.

## Notes to editors

  1. Bids were received from; 
    * Abellio InterCity West Coast Limited - NV Nederlandse Spoorwegen),
    * First West Coast Limited - FirstGroup plc,
    * Keolis / SNCF West Coast Limited - Keolis SA and SNCF,
    * Virgin Trains Limited - Virgin Group Holdings Limited.
  2. Virgin Trains has operated the franchise since 1997 and the existing contract expires on 9 December 2012. The new franchise will begin operation on Sunday 9 December 2012. The franchise will operate for a core term of 13 years and 4 months, with an option to be extended to operate for up to 15 years.
  3. The proposed Train Service Specification for new Inter City West Coast represents a relaxation from the rigid timetable specification of the past, while retaining obligations that protect the key elements of service, such as principal first and last trains and minimum numbers of station stops per week and per day. This marks a significant shift from the highly detailed specification which featured in previous franchise specifications.
  4. To support its bid, First West Coast Limited has provided £10m of Shareholder Capital, a £45m Performance bond agreement and a subordinated loan of £190m. This is in addition to the requirement to provide a Season Ticket bond of circa £5m and a £15m Parent Company Guarantee to ensure the new Station Facilities maintenance obligations are met.
  5. This longer franchise length encouraged investment in assets such as stations by extending the period over which commercially attractive schemes can pay back.
  6. Anytime fares allow the use of any train, including at weekday peak times. Anytime tickets are not the only ones available to walk-on passengers. Off-peak fares are also available on the day and - as their name implies - are generally valid on all but peak services.
  7. The new services are subject to obtaining the necessary permissions and access rights from the Office of Rail Regulation.
  8. ITSO is a government-backed common technical standard for smart travel which means that transport operators throughout Britain can link up so passengers only have to use one secure payment 'smart' card no matter what bus, train or route they are using.

The Department for Transport has given final approval to the scheme which will see work on a replacement bridge over the Portsmouth to London railway line at Cosham. The original bridge was built to carry a dual carriageway road but is now too weak to do so and traffic has been restricted to a single lane in each direction for a number of years.

The new bridge will allow the dual carriageway to be reinstated as well as removing any weight limit, bringing the bridge up to current national standards.

The scheme will restore the full standard of the bridge improving access to the local area and aiding the local economy by reducing congestion and ensuring that the route can be fully used, especially by the many buses which serve it.

Norman Baker said:

> ""This is an important scheme that will restore the full capacity of this route, help boost the local economy by reducing congestion and ensure journey time reliability for bus passengers.
> 
> ""The £11 million we are putting into this scheme shows that the coalition government is serious about investing in the infrastructure the country needs to drive economic growth.""

The Northern Road Bridge scheme was one of the schemes given funding approval last year as part of the Spending Review process. Work can now start on the construction with the new bridge scheduled to open in October 2013.

## Notes to editors

  1. Today's announcement grants Full (final) Approval to the Northern Road Bridge scheme enabling work to begin.
  2. The scheme, promoted Portsmouth City Council, is scheduled to open in October 2013.

Central to the project, Go Smarter to Work - Tyne and Wear Sustainable Transport Package, will be measures to relieve congestion on the A1 Western Bypass and make travelling to work in the area quicker and easier.

There will be new infrastructure such as bus priority lanes, cycle and walking routes and cycle parking at key transport interchanges. Those travelling on public transport will also benefit from real-time travel information facilities.

Innovative ideas have been developed to help those in areas where accessing work can be a significant problem and those living in remote rural areas will benefit from a scooter hire scheme to help them get to employment and training hubs.

The Department for Transport funding sees the final allocation of the government's local sustainable transport fund and is expected to unlock additional local contributions of £2.7 million.

Norman Baker said:

> ""The scheme we are funding will improve life for people in Tyne and Wear and show that cutting carbon and boosting economic growth and opportunity can go hand in hand.
> 
> ""Our investment in this scheme shows that we are serious about funding infrastructure where there is a clear business case for doing so. The money we are putting into this project will unlock much greater economic benefits for communities as well as improving the environment - it is a win-win for Tyne and Wear.""

The first allocations of Department for Transport support under the Local Sustainable Transport Fund were made in July 2011. Since then, the fund has provided schemes across English regions with a total of over £600m. All the schemes have also received significant contributions from local councils or the private sector.

These local schemes are bringing national benefits. In addition to supporting economic growth, while enabling and encouraging people to make more sustainable travel choices, the projects will reduce delays on the roads in urban areas, delays which cost the economy around £11 billion a year. They will also help tackle problems such as poor air quality and improved cycling and walking infrastructure will help to improve the health of the nation.

## Notes to editors

  1. Tyne and Wear Integrated Transport Authority (ITA) secured Local Sustainable Transport Funding of £4.904m in the first round of the fund in July 2011. A subsequent larger bid earlier this year did not secure funding but the ITA was invited to submit a revised proposal focusing on a specific geographic area. Today's announcement relates to this revised bid, which will receive £4.995 million from the Department for Transport.

The new service, which will operate on a line which has seen high growth levels, is being delivered thanks to an agreement between Southern Railway and the Department for Transport. The service will operate from Uckfield at 5.18am, arriving into London Bridge at 6.23am.

Southern is funding the new service in part from efficiencies it has delivered on its current franchise and the Department for Transport today formally agreed these savings can be used to provide the new service.

Transport Minister Norman Baker said:

> ""I am pleased to see the industry looking at solutions that deliver benefits to passengers.
> 
> ""Adding an additional service to this vital route will mean more seats for passengers, easing congestion and providing earlier travel to London.""

Southern's Franchise Improvement Director David Scorey said:

> ""The Uckfield line has seen significant growth in recent years and we are pleased that we have been able to find a way to respond to the increasing need for extra capacity, particularly on the morning service.""

The service will operate until the end of the Southern Franchise, at which point it may be operated by the successor franchise operator. The replacement Franchise specification is subject to a public consultation, which closed on 23 August 2012. Due to the general high level of interest in this particular consultation, DfT has agreed to accept responses to the TSGN consultation up to 1700 on Friday 14 September.

## Notes to editors

Q. Who is paying for the additional service?  
Southern has made efficiencies in delivering the committed obligations under the Franchise Agreement and this money along with a contribution from Southern will fund the additional service until the end of the Southern Franchise in July 2015.

Q. why can't Southern operate more trains on this route?  
This route is operated by diesel trains as part of the route between Uckfield and Hurst Green is not electrified. Southern has a limited number of diesel units that are dedicated to the services they operate on this route and the Ashford to Hasting route.

Q. What will happen when the Southern franchise ends?  
The replacement Franchise specification for the combined Thameslink, Southern, Great Northern Franchise is subject to a public consultation, closes on 23 August 2012. Due to the general high level of interest in this particular consultation, DfT has agreed to accept responses to the TSGN consultation up to 1700 on Friday 14 September.

Bidders for the new Franchise will be able to propose their own solutions for addressing longer term forecast demand, on the new franchise including the Uckfield and Hasting diesel routes in the longer term.

Q. Where will any additional Diesel trains come from in the future?  
There are a number of electrification schemes planned which should give bidders of new franchises the confidence to choose electric rolling stock which will mean diesel rolling stock will become available for alternative routes.

[Mr Baker partly approved proposals by London Midland to change the minimum opening hours at some ticket offices](http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/london-midland-ticket-office-opening-hours-decision), but protected the interests of passengers.

He has secured a number of important passenger benefits including:

  * An extra 29 ticket vending machines at stations which do not currently have them allowing passengers to buy tickets around the clock;
  * Additional shelters on platforms and better signage;
  * More boarding ramps for wheelchair users and station lifts to be kept in operation at all times. Passengers who require assistance in making their journey will also be able to book this via a new industry website launched by ATOC last month.

Four of the nine ticket offices proposed for closure have been approved, while five others have been rejected. The ticket offices that will be allowed to close are Cheddington, Lye, Witton and Wythall. Adderley Park, Bescot Stadium, Duddeston, Jewellery Quarter and Small Heath will remain open.

Norman Baker said:

> ""For example, Lye station, near Stourbridge, is currently staffed Mon-Fri for nearly 18 hours (from 0552-2346). On average across the week, it sells less than 4 tickets per hour. It is for this reason that we are allowing London Midland to close this ticket office.""

A number of ticket offices will be allowed to reduce their opening hours during very quiet periods, while several ticket offices at busy stations will have their minimum opening hours extended. A full list of the changes has been published on the department's website.

## Notes to editors

  1. The Ticketing and Settlement Agreement is the agreement between train operators that sets out the various arrangements between train operators relating to the carriage of passengers and the retailing of tickets. A copy of the latest version is available from the [ATOC website](http://www.atoc.org)
  2. The decision was referred to the Department for Transport to arbitrate under the existing rules of the Ticketing and Settlement Agreement.
  3. This decision is entirely separate from the recommendations made by Sir Roy McNulty, which recommended closure of ticket offices at a wider number of stations. The department is currently considering the recommendations of the McNulty report, and is looking at the issues in the context of a wider fares and ticketing review.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20120918a,More local decisions for transport schemes,"More of the decisions on the major transport schemes that have a significant impact on people's daily lives will be taken at a local level, Transport Minister Norman Baker has confirmed today.

A public consultation on the devolution of decision-making on major local schemes showed broad support for the proposals and the Department for Transport will now be going ahead with the plans outlined in the consultation.

Local major transport schemes have traditionally been individually approved and funded by government under a centralised bidding process. In the future funding will be allocated locally according to population, allowing priorities to be decided by newly established local transport bodies which will be made up of local transport authorities, local enterprise partnerships (LEPs) and others with a key interest.

Norman Baker said:

> ""We want decisions on new transport infrastructure to be made more efficiently, and at a more local level than has previously been the case.
> 
> ""While it is right for the government to look at the big picture and co-ordinate schemes with a national impact, there is no substitute for local knowledge. That is why we want to make sure that important decisions affecting the future of towns and cities across England are made by those who best understand the specific issues facing their communities.""

Decisions on the use of the devolved funding will be made by local transport bodies which will be expected to demonstrate to local stakeholders and central government that the schemes they will carry forward provide good value for money. Detailed guidance on how to provide this assurance will be published by the Department for Transport in due course.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20120920b,Drivers and cyclists agree “let's look out for each other”,"A new poll for the Department for Transport's THINK! campaign has found that 25% of UK adults are noticing more cyclists on the road after our cycling summer of success. With the 'Wiggins Effect' putting more people on the road, staying safe is a priority.

A new THINK! campaign, 'THINK CYCLIST', calls on drivers and cyclists to stay safe this autumn by looking out for each other - pointing out that drivers and cyclists have more in common than is often realised. With 80% of cyclists holding a driving licence, and 1 in 5 drivers cycling at least once a month , they are often the same people.

The THINK CYCLIST poll has also showed that cyclists and drivers agree on how to stay safe on the road.

  * Looking twice for each other when turning or at junctions came out top for both as the precaution that would avoid the most collisions (41% of regular cyclists, and 35% of regular car drivers).
  * Both also agree on how to make things better, with 67% of cyclists and 59% of drivers saying that giving each other space on the road was in their top three ways of making cyclists and drivers more visible to road users.

Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond said:

> ""We take the issue of cycle safety extremely seriously so we are launching 'THINK CYCLIST', a campaign aimed at both cyclists and drivers.
> 
> ""With interest in cycling heightened by Bradley Wiggins winning the Tour de France and our cyclists' extraordinary success at the Olympics and Paralympics too, we want to remind cyclists and drivers of the importance of looking out for each other to avoid accidents.
> 
> ""Many people cycle and drive and a new THINK! poll shows both road user groups agree that looking twice at junctions, as well as giving each other space on the road, are practical things that we can all do to help reduce the numbers of cyclists killed and seriously injured on our roads each year.""

The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson said:

> ""The safety of London's road users is an absolute priority for me and improved cycle safety in particular is at the heart of all our work. So with ever more Londoners taking to the streets on two wheels, many inspired by our amazing summer of sport, the THINK CYCLIST campaign is a timely reminder of the need for road users to respect each other and make the city a safer place.""

THINK CYCLIST is calling on drivers and cyclists to

  * Look out for each other, especially when turning
  * Signal intentions so that the other road user can react
  * Give cyclists space and remember that cyclists are advised to ride well clear of the kerb to be visible and avoid collisions

This is the first time that THINK! has targeted cyclists and drivers together, and the campaign has the support of organisations such as the RAC, AA and IAM The campaign will be working with motoring and cycling organisations nationally and locally to help to get safety messages to their members.

RAC technical director David Bizley said:

> ""RAC welcomes any measure which helps improve safety for all road users and clearly with the growing interest in cycling there is a need for greater prominence of cycle safety. Many of our members are cyclists as well as drivers and we are keen to see greater awareness of the needs and risks presented by modern road use to, potentially, vulnerable cyclists.""

AA President Edmund King said:

> ""There are too many accidents between cars and cyclists. We need to look for each other whether opening a car door or changing lanes. As fuel prices rise and fitness moves higher up the agenda there will be more cyclists. Drivers need to think more about cyclists on the road.""

Chief executive of the IAM Simon Best said:

> ""Whether you're on two wheels or four, you are responsible for the safety of others. All accidents are preventable. By being considerate and eradicating bad habits we can significantly reduce accidents.""

  3. THINK CYCLIST advice:  
When you're driving 
    1. Look out for cyclists, especially when turning - make eye contact if possible so they know you've seen them
    2. Use your indicators - signal your intentions so that cyclists can react
    3. Give cyclists space - at least half a car's width. If there isn't sufficient space to pass, hold back. Remember that cyclists may need to manoeuvre suddenly if the road is poor, it's windy or if a car door is opened.
    4. Always check for cyclists when you open your car door
    5. Avoid driving over advance stop lines - these allow cyclists to get to the front and increase their visibility
    6. Follow the Highway Code including 'stop' and 'give way' signs and traffic lights

When you're cycling

    1. Ride positively, decisively and well clear of the kerb - look and signal to show drivers what you plan to do and make eye contact where possible so you know drivers have seen you.
    2. Avoid riding up the inside of large vehicles, like lorries or buses, where you might not be seen
    3. Always use lights after dark or when visibility is poor
    4. Wearing light coloured or reflective clothing during the day and reflective clothing and/or accessories in the dark increases your visibility
    5. Follow the Highway Code including observing 'stop' and 'give way' signs and traffic lights
  4. THINK! recommends wearing a correctly fitted cycle helmet, which is securely fastened and conforms to current regulations
  5. All figures, unless otherwise stated, are from YouGov Plc. Total sample size was 2117 adults. Fieldwork was undertaken between 21st - 23th August 2012. The survey was carried out online. The figures have been weighted and are representative of all UK adults (aged 18+).
  6. DfT Reported Road Casualties in Great Britain 2011 states that : 
    * The number of pedal cyclists killed fell by 4 per cent from 111 in 2010 to 107 in 2011.
    * The number of seriously injured casualties increased by 16 per cent to 3,085.
    * The total number of killed and seriously injured cyclists in creased by 15% to 3,192

Designation of the line between Exeter St David's and Exmouth will enable train companies to work more closely with the Avocet Line Rail Users Group and the Devon and Cornwall Rail Partnership to better design services to meet local needs.

Community Rail Minister Norman Baker said:

> ""I want to encourage communities to become more closely involved with their railways to help create the services and stations passengers deserve.
> 
> ""That is why I am delighted to announce this latest community rail service designation and to be able to do so on the day of the National Community Rail Awards.

Mark Hopwood, Managing Director of First Great Western, which runs services on the line, said:

> ""At First Great Western we're committed supporters of community rail and fully endorse the benefits that working closely with our local partners can bring. We very much welcome the designation of the Avocet Line which will enable it to take full advantage of the benefits that are available to all our other thriving community rail branch lines.""

Tony Day, Chairman of the Avocet Line Rail Users Group said:

> ""Last year, when we celebrated the 150th anniversary of the opening of the railway to Exmouth, people from the communities along it showed their enormous support for the Avocet Line. They will depend on it more and more in future years, as new housing in Exmouth and the east of Exeter adds passengers to this already busy commuter railway. I look forward to the involvement of those communities in shaping the line's development.""

Richard Burningham, Manager of the Devon & Cornwall Rail Partnership said:

> ""It is great to welcome the busy Avocet Line to the community rail family. This designation will help us, the Avocet Line Rail Users Group, Devon County Council and others work together more closely still to further develop and improve the line and its service in partnership with the rail industry.""

## Notes to editors

  1. The Community Rail Development Strategy looks at innovative ways of operating local branch lines, through a programme of cost management, a drive to increase passenger numbers and direct community involvement via local authorities, community rail partnerships and other stakeholder groups.
  2. To date, 18 lines with their services have been designated as community rail lines: 
    * St Ives Bay Line: St Erth to St Ives June 2005. Selected as one of the six pilot projects.
    * Abbey Line: St Albans Abbey to Watford Junction June 2005. Selected as one of the six pilot projects.
    * Esk Valley Line: Middlesbrough to Whitby June 2005. Selected as one of the six pilot lines.
    * Tamar Valley Line: Plymouth to Gunnislake September 2005. Linked with Looe Valley as one of the six pilot projects.
    * Looe Valley Line: Liskeard to Looe September 2005. Linked with Tamar Valley as one of the six pilot projects.
    * Penistone Line: Barnsley to Huddersfield September 2005. Selected as one of the six pilot projects.
    * Island Line: Isle of Wight (Ryde to Shanklin) March 2006.
    * Tarka Line: Barnstaple to Cowley Junction Exeter September 2006.

    * Lymington Line: Brockenhurst - Lymington July 2008.
    * Preston to Ormskirk Line: Preston to Ormskirk September 2011.
  3. Additionally, 14 services have been designated as community rail services whilst not designating the lines on which they run. These services are designated when there are reasons why the infrastructure cannot be included in the designation - because it carries non local traffic or heavy freight or has previously been designated as part of the Trans European Network. To date the following services have been designated: 
    * Poacher Line: Grantham to Skegness July 2006. Selected as one of the six pilot projects.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20120928b,Greater rights for motorists,"From Monday (October 1) motorists will be given greater rights as new laws banning wheel clamping and towing take effect.

It will be an offence to clamp, tow, block-in or immobilise a vehicle without lawful authority on private land under the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012. These changes will end abuses by rogue clamping firms who prey on motorists by charging excessive release fees. If clampers break the law, they could be liable to an unlimited fine in the Crown Court or up to £5,000 in a Magistrates Court.

Lord Taylor of Holbeach, the Home Office Minister with responsibility for changes to vehicle clamping law, said:

> ""This common sense ban will give motorists the protection they deserve against rogue wheel-clamping and towing companies.
> 
> ""It will save motorists £55 million each year in clamping charges and finally penalise the real criminals - the corrupt firms themselves.""

Other changes to vehicle laws include extending police powers to remove vehicles parked on private land. This will ensure landowners have a means to keep their land clear from obstructive or dangerously parked cars.

The Department for Transport is also strengthening laws around ticketing, so unpaid charges can be claimed from the keeper of the vehicle, as well as the driver. The government has also agreed that an Independent Appeals Service funded by the British Parking Association will be established from 1 October. This free service will allow motorists to appeal a parking charge issued on private land by a company that is a member of the BPA's Approved Operator Scheme.

Local Transport Minister Norman Baker said:

> ""These new parking arrangements deliver a fairer legal framework for motorists and landowners, while getting rid of the indiscriminate clamping and towing by private companies for good.""

These changes are being introduced on Monday as part of the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012, which received Royal Assent in May this year. They were all raised by members of the public through a cross-government survey, 'Your Freedom'. People had the chance to suggest ideas on restoring liberties that have been lost, repealing unnecessary laws and stripping away excessive regulation. The Act aims to restore traditional British freedoms to the heart of the Whitehall agenda.

## Notes to editors

**Home Office: Wheel clamping ban**

  1. Evidence collated by the government showed that around 500,000 clampings were taking place annually on private land with an average release fee of £112 and almost all clamp fees were paid.
  2. The ban will not change existing lawful authority, such as traffic enforcement by local authorities and police on highways, but will effectively ban clamping on private land.
  3. The ban also applies to towing away and blocking in. Anyone who clamps a vehicle or tows it away on private land without specific lawful authority to do so may face criminal proceedings.
  4. Lawful authority to clamp or tow vehicles will remain for various organisations and public bodies. For example, the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Authority (DVLA) will retain the legal authority to clamp or tow away vehicles as part of its work in combating evasion of Vehicle Excise Duty. The Vehicle and Operator Services Authority has similar powers to prevent the use of un-roadworthy vehicles on the road. Others include airports, ports, as well as some railway stations and common land.

**Extension of police powers to move vehicles parked dangerously on private land**

  5. The extension of police powers will not constitute a duty on the police to remove vehicles. It is expected that police forces will respond in light of the circumstances of the incident and available resources.
  6. The government set up the Your Freedom website to allow members of the public to suggest unnecessary laws which should be repealed. There was a commitment to take views expressed into account when considering the scope of the Protection of Freedoms Bill. The removal of restrictions on time for civil partnership and marriage ceremonies was considered an appropriate repeal to include within the Bill, which received Royal Assent in May 2012.
  7. For more information, contact the Home Office press office on 020 7035 3535.

**Department for Transport measures**

  8. The Government is strengthening the enforcement arrangements for ticketing in private car parks, by allowing landowners to reclaim unpaid parking charges from the keeper of a vehicle if the driver is not known and the keeper refuses to say who the driver is.
  9. [Guidance on the new provisions is available](http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/guidance-unpaid-parking-charges/) .
  10. As part of this change from October 1st 2012, car parking operators who are members of the British Parking Association's Approved Operator Scheme (AOS), will be required to offer motorists a new independent appeals service called 'Parking on Private Land Appeals' (POPLA).
  11. POPLA will be provided as a free service to motorists and will be operated by London Councils who also run the appeals service for Transport for London and London Borough Council issued tickets. Its decisions will be binding on parking operators, but not on motorists.
  12. The Independent Appeals Service will be able to consider whether car park operators are providing motorists with adequate signs, which clearly lay out the terms and conditions of parking. They will also consider whether parking charges are reasonable under relevant contract and consumer protection legislation.
  13. Car parks managed by operators who are not members of an Accredited Trade Association and are therefore not able to request registered keeper details from DVLA, will not be covered by POPLA.
  14. For more information on these areas, call the Department for Transport on 020 7944 3066.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20121001a,Better protection for UK holidaymakers,"Aviation Minister Simon Burns has announced new rules coming into force today to better protect holidaymakers from losing out if their travel company fails.

Anyone who books an ATOL protected holiday or flight will immediately get an ATOL certificate confirming the details of the booking and their level of protection. It is designed to make clear to UK holidaymakers in a simple, straightforward way how their holiday is financially protected.

With holidays protected by the Air Travel Organisers' Licensing(ATOL) scheme passengers get either a full refund or repatriation if they are already abroad when their holiday company becomes insolvent.

Simon Burns said:

> ""The internet has made booking a holiday easier but that can lead to a lack of clarity on the important matter of what happens if the holiday company runs into trouble.
> 
> ""The ATOL Certificate will give peace of mind to millions when booking their holiday. Whether on a computer, the phone or in a travel agent, holidaymakers will not only complete their booking but also receive a certificate removing any doubt over their level of cover.
> 
> ""I want this certificate to become a standard travel document that families will expect alongside their flight tickets and holiday details.""

Dame Deirdre Hutton, Chair of the Civil Aviation Authority, said:

> ""It's been clear for some time that people are confused about holiday financial protection, and consumers have told us that they want more clarity about how their holidays are protected. The introduction of the ATOL Certificate will mean that people can clearly see on one standard document what is protected, who is protecting it and what they should do if their company fails.
> 
> ""It's a change in the scheme that will make simple what currently can seem very complex: with the certificate consumers have protection, without it they do not.""

The ATOL Certificate is the final stage of reforms introduced on 30th April to modernise the scheme, including bringing Flight Plus holidays into the ATOL scheme and returning it to financial self-sustainability.

The Civil Aviation Bill currently going through Parliament includes a clause which could enable the Transport Secretary to make further changes to the ATOL scheme in future. This could mean holidays sold by airlines and holidays arranged on an 'agent for the consumer' basis being brought into the scheme.

## Notes to editors

  1. The ATOL scheme is administered by the Civil Aviation Authority and ensures passengers who have not already travelled receive a full refund or are brought home free of charge if abroad at the time of insolvency.
  2. The ATOL Certificate is a standard document issued by anyone selling an ATOL-protected holiday, which makes clear how the trip is protected and by whom.
  3. An estimated 38.3 million people flew abroad on leisure trips in 2011. In the year to 31 March 2012 there were 17.3m ATOL protected holidays and flights, and nearly 82,000 holidaymakers were repatriated or received full refunds when their ATOL tour operator went bust.
  4. Most businesses selling package holidays including a flight have to have an ATOL licence issued by the CAA. Businesses pay £2.50 for each booking into the Air Travel Trust Fund that meets the costs of refunds and repatriations.
  5. The ATOL scheme was first put in place on a statutory basis in the early 1970s. It was last substantially overhauled in 1995.
  6. Airlines are legally exempt from the requirement to hold an ATOL licence, however, any package holidays they sell must still be financially protected, under the Package Travel Regulations. A number of UK airlines have subsequently set up subsidiary companies to sell package holidays that do have an ATOL licence.
  7. Further details on the Civil Aviation Bill which is currently proceeding through Parliament are [available on the Department for Transport website](http://www.dft.gov.uk/topics/legislation/civil-aviation-bill).
  8. On 30 April 2012, changes were put in place to improve the clarity of the ATOL scheme's coverage by including in it Flight-Plus holidays. This should also help the schemes' finances to return to a secure self-sustaining footing. Following a series of high-profile insolvencies in recent years, the Air Travel Trust Fund is currently running at a deficit, supported by a government-backed guarantee. It is hoped the new rules will eliminate this within three years, reducing the risk to the taxpayer.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20121003a,West Coast Main Line franchise competition cancelled,"Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin has today announced that the competition to run trains on the West Coast Main Line has been cancelled following the discovery of significant technical flaws in the way the franchise process was conducted.

The decision means that the Department for Transport (DfT) will no longer be awarding a franchise contract to run the West Coast service when the current franchise expires on December 9. It is consequently no longer contesting the judicial review sought by Virgin Trains Ltd in the High Court.

The flaws uncovered relate to the way the procurement was conducted by department officials. An announcement will be made later today concerning the suspension of staff while an investigation takes place.

The government is resolving urgently the future arrangements for operation of the West Coast and will ensure that train services continue uninterrupted. Mr McLoughlin stressed today that passengers will continue to be served by the same trains and frontline staff.

The Transport Secretary has also:

  * ordered two independent reviews to be undertaken urgently: the first into what went wrong with the West Coast competition and the lessons to be learned, the second into the wider DfT rail franchise programme, both overseen by leading business figures;
  * asked officials to examine the options for the operation of the West Coast service after December 9, taking into account procurement and competition law;
  * paused all the other outstanding franchise competitions (Great Western, Essex Thameside and Thameslink) pending the independent reviews which are designed to ensure future competitions are robust and deliver best value for passengers and tax payers.

Mr McLoughlin said:

> ""I have had to cancel the competition for the running of the West Coast franchise because of deeply regrettable and completely unacceptable mistakes made by my department in the way it managed the process.
> 
> ""A detailed examination by my officials into what happened has revealed these flaws and means it is no longer possible to award a new franchise on the basis of the competition that was held.
> 
> ""I have ordered two independent reviews to look urgently and thoroughly into the matter so that we know what exactly happened and how we can make sure our rail franchise programme is fit for purpose.""

He added:

> ""West Coast passengers can rest assured that while we seek urgently to resolve the future arrangements the trains that run now will continue to run, with the same drivers, the same staff and timetables as planned. The tickets that people have booked will continue to be valid and passengers will be able to make their journeys as planned.""

DfT permanent secretary Philip Rutnam said:

> ""The errors exposed by our investigation are deeply concerning. They show a lack of good process and a lack of proper quality assurance.
> 
> ""I am determined to identify exactly what went wrong and why, and to put these things right so that we never find ourselves in this position again.""

The first independent review will be an urgent independent examination into the lessons to be learned from the department's handling of this competition. Conducted by independent advisers and overseen by Centrica chief executive Sam Laidlaw and former PricewaterhouseCoopers strategy chairman Ed Smith, both DfT non-executive directors, this review will look as soon as possible at what happened and why with a view to delivering an initial report by the end of October.

The second independent review will be undertaken by Eurostar chairman Richard Brown CBE, and examine the wider rail franchising programme. It will look in detail at whether changes are needed to the way risk is assessed and to the bidding and evaluation processes, and at how to get the other franchise competitions back on track as soon as possible. This will report back by the end of December.

Evidence of significant flaws in the department's approach emerged while officials were undertaking very detailed evidence-gathering in preparation for legal proceedings in the High Court.

These flaws stem from the way the level of risk in the bids was evaluated. Mistakes were made in the way in which inflation and passenger numbers were taken into account, and how much money bidders were then asked to guarantee as a result.

The department cannot be confident that these flaws would not have changed the outcome of the competition or that any of the four bidders would not have chosen to submit different offers.

The DfT has spoken to the four bidding companies to inform them of the flaws that the department discovered. The DfT will reimburse their bid costs and has assured them that a fresh competition will be started as soon as the lessons of this episode are learned.

Designation of the line between Leeds to Morecambe will enable train companies to work more closely with the Leeds, Lancaster and Morecambe Community Rail Partnership to better design services to meet local needs.

Community Rail Minister Norman Baker said:

> ""I want to encourage communities to become more closely involved with their railways to help create the services and stations passengers deserve.
> 
> ""That's why I am delighted to announce this latest community rail service designation. Today's designation is a major step towards helping the Leeds, Lancaster and Morecambe Community Rail Partnership work closely with local groups to provide innovative and more cost effective rail services for their community.""

Ian Bevan, Managing Director of Northern Rail, which runs services on the route, said:

> ""The designation of the Bentham Line is fantastic news for the local community. As this route is integral to the area, its designation ensures it will be developed to benefit local people and visitors to the region. We look forward to working with the community rail partnership to enable the route to prosper as much as possible.""

Councillor Richard Rollins, Chairman of the Leeds, Lancaster and Morecambe Community Rail Partnership said:

> ""This is excellent news. Designation will enable the Community Rail Partnership to work in partnership with the local community to make significant developments along the line. Key objectives include station improvements and service developments.""

## Notes to editors

  1. The Community Rail Development Strategy looks at innovative ways of operating local branch lines, through a programme of cost management, a drive to increase passenger numbers and direct community involvement via local authorities, community rail partnerships, and other stakeholder groups.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20121025a,Government unveils generous HS2 compensation package,"Residents affected by the first phase of HS2 from London to the West Midlands will be offered a comprehensive package of compensation measures which go significantly beyond statutory requirements, the government confirmed today.

HS2, a national high-speed rail network linking Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds with London and Heathrow, will transform the UK - bringing cities together, delivering jobs and growth, and providing a long-term solution to the capacity crunch facing the existing rail network. Stations will also be situated in the East Midlands and South Yorkshire, while high speed trains will continue on the existing rail network to serve destinations further north and into Scotland. The government has already consulted on the route of the first phase of the project to the West Midlands and the Transport Secretary will publish his preferred routes for the second phase of the scheme later this year.

However, the government recognises the impact the project is having on property markets along the first phase of the route and, after careful consideration, has decided to go above and beyond what is required by law.

The measures proposed today go beyond the statutory requirements by:

  * providing a government commitment to buy any owner-occupied home in the 'safeguarded area' closest to the route. As set out in law, the government will then pay the full un-blighted value of the property, along with additional compensation of 10 per cent up to a value of £47,000;
  * establishing a 'voluntary purchase zone' immediately outside of the safeguarded area in rural areas, within which homeowners can sell their homes at their full un-blighted value; 
  * a long term hardship scheme to help those with a need to move during the development of HS2 but who are unable to sell their home; 
  * a sale and rent back scheme to give more flexibility to homeowners who wish to stay in properties which will ultimately be required to allow for construction work;
  * a package of measures to provide clarity and reinforce confidence in properties above tunnels, including before and after surveys;
  * a commitment to work with local authorities, housing associations and affected tenants to develop a strategy for replacing any lost social rented housing.

Rail minister Simon Burns said:

> ""HS2 will completely transform the UK. It will define our country, not just for the 21st century but beyond - linking our major cities in a way previous generations could only dream of.
> 
> ""No major infrastructure project on this scale can be built without some impact on local communities, but I am determined to do everything I can to minimise the effect of HS2 on those closest to the line.
> 
> ""We have developed the right compensation package, providing absolutely the right support for those affected, while at the same time protecting the interests of taxpayers. We have thought long and hard about this and the measures I have announced are fair and strike the right balance for local communities and the British taxpayer.""

The compensation package announced today is comparable with the arrangements put in place for homeowners affected by the construction of HS1. It will now be subject to a period of consultation until 31st January 2013.

Alongside the proposed compensation package, HS2 Ltd and the Department for Transport has also launched a three-month consultation aimed at local authorities on safeguarding the land needed in order to build and run the line between London and the West Midlands. Safeguarding is the technical term for the planning mechanism that protects large-scale public infrastructure projects from conflicting developments nearby.

## Notes to Editors

  1. The consultation document [High Speed Two: Property and Compensation for London - West Midlands](http://highspeedrail.dft.gov.uk/consultations/property-compensation-london-to-west-midlands) closes on 31st January 2013: 

Consultation events for the property compensation consultation will take place along the line of route.

Further information is available on the [high speed rail consultation website](http://highspeedrail.dft.gov.uk/) or by contacting the HS2 enquiries line on: 0207 944 4908.

### Safeguarding Consultation

  2. The consultation document [High Speed Two: Safeguarding for London - West Midlands](http://highspeedrail.dft.gov.uk/consultations/safeguarding) is available and closes on 31st January 2013: 

This consultation is aimed at planning authorities. An email is being sent to local authorities, community forums and MPs inviting them to participate.

  3. Further details on the compensation measures published today: 

**Streamlined system of advanced purchase within the safeguarded zone**

Under these measures, owner-occupiers of residential properties and owners of commercial properties (with a rateable value not exceeding £34,800) where some or all of the property is within the safeguarded area (usually 60 metres either side of the track) will be able to ask the government to purchase their property under compulsory terms at a time of their choosing after safeguarding directions are made (expected Spring 2013). This means they will receive the unblighted open market value of the property, a home loss payment (10% of the value of the property, up to £47,000) and disturbance costs (such as fees, removal costs and stamp duty on a new property of equivalent value).

The government proposes that where the entirety of an eligible property is within the safeguarded area and the owner asks the government to purchase their property we will agree, whether it is actually required for the railway or not. We will also consider purchase requests where only part of a property is within the safeguarded zone.

**Streamlined system for voluntary purchase within a new voluntary purchase zone in rural areas**

The government will also establish a new voluntary purchase zone outside of the immediate safeguarded zone within which owner-occupiers of residential property or owners of commercial property (with a rateable value not exceeding £34,800) will be also able to ask the government to purchase their property for its unblighted open market value.

As the impact of HS2 on the property market has been and is expected to continue to be greater in rural areas than in urban areas the Voluntary Purchase Zone will run from the M25 northwards to the south of the delta junction to Birmingham and to the north of the delta junction with the junction with the West Coast Main Line. The voluntary purchase zone will cover an area 120m either side of the line of route, except over bored tunnels.

**A hardship scheme for those beyond the safeguarded and voluntary purchase zones**

Those with a need to move during the development of HS2 but who are unable to sell their home despite being outside both the safeguarded area and the voluntary purchase zone will be able to apply to have the government purchase their homes under a hardship scheme.

**A sale and rent back scheme**

This will allow homeowners whose property will need to be demolished to sell their property to the government when they wish but remain in their homes as tenants until their land is actually needed for construction.

**A series of measures designed to provide peace of mind for property owners above tunnels**

Providing before and after surveys at government expense and a 'settlement deed' which will guarantee that HS2 would be liable for any damage caused by tunnelling, in perpetuity.

  4. While the Safeguarding Consultation is aimed primarily at local authorities, individuals are welcome to contribute if they wish. However, if they are particularly interested in the proposed compensation arrangements for the impact safeguarding has on their home or property, they are encouraged to respond to the Property and Compensation consultation.

Sam Laidlaw, the senior business figure and DfT non-executive director leading this independent review, has asked the DfT to release the following statement on behalf of his inquiry:

> ""In the limited time available this is necessarily only a preliminary report. What is clear however is that in seeking to run a complex and novel franchising competition process, an accumulation of significant errors, described in the report, resulted in a flawed process.
> 
> ""These errors appear to have been caused by factors including inadequate planning and preparation, a complex organisational structure and a weak governance and quality assurance framework.

10 September 2012 marks four years since the introduction of the Driver CPC for bus and coach drivers, and three years since its introduction for lorry drivers. Under Driver CPC, professional bus, coach and lorry drivers have to complete 35 hours of accredited training every five years. 

Drivers who acquired their vocational licence before the introduction of Driver CPC have five years from its introduction to complete the required 35 hours. This means the deadline for bus and coach drivers is September 2013, and for lorry drivers it is September 2014.

Since Driver CPC was introduced over half a million professional drivers across the goods and passenger sectors have undertaken accredited periodic training, further developing their knowledge and skills and helping to ensure they remain safe and responsible drivers throughout their careers.

DSA chief executive, Rosemary Thew, said:

> ""I would urge all drivers who haven't yet started periodic training not to leave it until the last minute. If the deadline arrives and you drive professionally without a Driver CPC, you'll be committing an offence. 
> 
> ""If you're an operator and you cause or allow your drivers to drive without Driver CPC - you'll also be committing an offence. 
> 
> ""The idea of drivers completing regular training throughout their working life is not new - many have been doing it for years through operators who recognise the benefits of drivers developing their skills; helping to boost productivity as well as improve road safety.""

There are now over 3,000 approved training courses available to drivers, covering a whole range of topics from fuel efficiency to tachograph and drivers' hours regulations or defensive driving. All courses and providers have to meet strict criteria and are subject to ongoing quality assurance to ensure they meet the required standard. [Courses can be found on the Directgov website](http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Motoring/Drivingforaliving/Drivinglorriesbusesandcoaches/DG_186131).

The DSA worked with the haulage and passenger transport industries to develop these and they address specific issues such as the use of tachographs and the dangers of continuous driving.

The National Driving Standard Category C™ (lorry) and National Driving Standard Category D™ (bus and coach) outline what drivers need to know, understand and be able to do in areas such as:

  * preparing a vehicle and its occupants for a journey
  * guiding and controlling a vehicle
  * using the road in accordance with the Highway Code
  * driving safely and responsibly in the traffic system
  * reviewing and adjusting driver behaviour over a lifetime

DSA chief executive, Rosemary Thew, said: 

> ""The haulage and passenger transport industries are a vital part of Britain's economy and have an important role to play in keeping our roads among the safest in the world. 
> 
> ""The publication of these Standards will help to ensure that all bus and lorry drivers acquire the right skills, knowledge and attitude to use our roads safely and responsibly, as well as contributing to cutting the human and financial cost of road accidents.
> 
> ""I want to thank the haulage and passenger transport industries and the sector skills councils for their input into the development of the Standards. These will enhance the excellent training that is already available and contribute to the work the DSA is doing to set standards for everyone who uses a motorised vehicle on the public roads.""

The Standards should form the basis of training that a lorry, bus or coach driver receives - and so the training industry is encouraged to create courses that address them. This includes both the training that drivers complete to professionally (Driver CPC) and training for those who don't drive for a living. 

The Standards build on National Driving Standard Category B™ that defines safe and responsible driving for car and light van drivers. They are based on evidence, open to challenge and regularly reviewed to ensure they are relevant and up to date.

The publication of the Standards fulfils the commitment made in the Government's Strategic Framework for Road Safety to extend the standards framework to cover categories C and D.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/press-dft-20121007a,Reduced cap on rail fare rises,"Passengers will benefit from a cut of up to 2% to the planned rises in the cost of nationwide train travel and travel on London buses and tubes following today's announcement by Prime Minister David Cameron.

The average increase in regulated rail fares and the cost of travel on London's buses and tube network will be limited to one per cent above inflation for 2013 and 2014. Rail fares had been due to increase by RPI+3%, while fares on London buses and tubes had been due to rise by RPI+2% in 2013.

This is expected to benefit more than a quarter of a million annual season ticket holders who can expect to have an extra £45 back in their pockets as a result of today's decision. Many more holders of weekly and monthly season tickets could also see lower fares and some commuters will be over £200 better off over the two years.

The Department for Transport (DfT) is planning that from January 2015 onwards the regulated fares cap for franchised train operators will increase by RPI+1%.

The decision to reduce the planned increases, funded from savings identified in the DfT's budget, will benefit hard-pressed commuters and passengers. In future years the DfT will look to absorb the costs by reprioritising within existing budgets.

The fares national rail passengers pay will continue to support our major programme of rail improvements, the largest in scale since the Victorian era. It will deliver crucial benefits for passengers, including relief from crowding on some of the nation's busiest routes.

The government still believes it is vital that efficiencies are found in the cost of running the railways so that we can deliver better value for money for both taxpayers and farepayers and end the era of above-inflation rises.

## Notes to editors

  * The 2010 Spending Review announced that the cap on average regulated rail fares increase would be the RPI rate of inflation plus 3 per cent in 2012, 2013 and 2014. In the Autumn Statement last year, the government lowered the cap on increases to RPI+1 per cent for 2012.
  * The July RPI used in the calculation of rail fares is 3.2%. So from January 2013 the average rise in regulated rail fares will be 4.2%.
  * The independent McNulty Rail Value for Money study published in 2011 highlighted that while our railways are performing well operationally, they cost too much to run. If we can make substantial reductions to the cost of running the railways and the improvement in the wider economic situation permits, we can bring to an end the era of above inflation fare rises in average regulated fares, while continuing to expand capacity on our rail network.
  * The Government regulates the existence and price of certain rail fares: generally, commuter fares and the majority of long-distance off-peak fares.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/press-dft-20121008a,£170 million road boost for local economies,"The Highways Agency is to deliver 57 vital road improvements to boost the economy, reduce congestion and improve safety, Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin announced today.

The £170 million investment is part of a £217 million programme to remove bottlenecks and keep traffic moving on England's motorways and major A roads. The economic benefit of these 57 schemes is estimated at around £3 billion.

Many of the improvements will be delivered in 2013 and 2014, and they will all be completed by March 2015. Today's announcement brings the total number of schemes to receive investment from the government's pinch point fund to 65. A third stage of projects will be announced next year.

Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said:

> ""These £217 million road improvements prove the government's determination to accelerate growth and cut congestion.
> 
> ""Keeping traffic moving is vital to securing prosperity. By removing bottlenecks and improving access to local enterprise zones, key international trading ports and communities, these road schemes will help get people to and from work and power the economy. They also have the potential to help deliver more than 300,000 new jobs and 150,000 new homes.""

The improvements include an £11 million scheme to widen and improve junction 4 of the M5 near Bromsgrove, with significant benefits for Longbridge, former home of the MG Rover manufacturing plant. It will support a local authority and local enterprise partnership development plan that aims to create around 10,000 jobs and 3,000 homes in the region.

At junction 5 of the M27, near Eastleigh, a £4.9 million scheme will reduce congestion by widening approach roads and slips roads and providing a segregated left turn lane onto the M27 eastbound. This supports several local development plans, including Solent Enterprise Zone, Eastleigh Riverside, Southampton Airport and Southampton City Centre, with the potential to create around 12,000 jobs and 7,000 homes.

These improvement schemes form part of the government's growth initiative outlined during the Chancellor's Autumn Statement in November 2011. Funds have been allocated to the Highways Agency to undertake focused improvements to the strategic road network.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/press-dft-20121015a,Department for Transport to negotiate with Virgin on temporary operation of West Coast rail services,"The Department for Transport will negotiate with Virgin Rail Group for them to continue providing rail services on the West Coast Main Line for a temporary period.

The current franchise is due to expire on 9 December after which it is the government's intention that Virgin remain as operator for a short period - expected to be between 9 and 13 months - while a competition is run for an interim franchise agreement. This interim agreement, which would be open to any bidders, will then run until the new long term West Coast franchise is ready to commence.

The government believes that this is the best way to ensure services are maintained and that there is no impact on passengers.

Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said:

> ""The cancellation of the InterCity West Coast franchise is deeply regrettable and I apologise to the bidders involved and the taxpayer who have a right to expect better.
> 
> ""My priority now is to fix the problem and the first step is to take urgent action to ensure that on the 9 December services continue to run to the same standard and passengers are not affected.
> 
> ""I believe Virgin remaining as operator for a short period of time is the best way to do this and my officials and I will be working flat out to make this happen.""

On 3 October the previous competition to run trains on this line was cancelled following the discovery of significant technical flaws in the way the franchise process was conducted.

The department also paused the on-going franchise programme including live competitions on Essex Thameside, Great Western and Thameslink and set up two independent reviews into what went wrong with the West Coast competition and the wider DfT rail franchise programme.

## Notes to editors

  1. The Transport Secretary has ordered two independent reviews:
  2. The [first will be an urgent independent examination into the lessons to be learned from the department's handling of West Coast competition](http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/sam-laidlaw-20121015b/). Conducted by independent advisers and overseen by Centrica chief executive Sam Laidlaw and former PricewaterhouseCoopers strategy chairman Ed Smith, both Department for Transport non-executive directors, this review will look as soon as possible at what happened and why with a view to delivering an initial report by the end of October.
  3. The [second independent review will be undertaken by Eurostar chairman Richard Brown CBE](http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/richard-brown-20121015a/), and examine the wider rail franchising programme. It will look in detail at whether changes are needed to the way risk is assessed and to the bidding and evaluation processes, and at how to get the other franchise competitions back on track as soon as possible. This will report back by the end of December.

I can today announce that Abellio Greater Anglia Limited has been awarded the Greater Anglia (Short) franchise.

The new franchise will begin operation on Sunday 5 February 2012. It will operate for 29 months (32 rail industry periods).

Bids were received from Abellio Greater Anglia Limited (NV Nederlandse Spoorwegen), Eastern Railway Limited (Go-Ahead Group PLC), and Stagecoach Anglia Trains Limited (Stagecoach Group plc).

Abellio Greater Anglia Limited has been chosen to run trains on the network, which operates across Essex, Suffolk, Norfolk and Cambridgeshire. The franchise will also play a significant role in transport for the London 2012 Games providing crucial services to the Olympic Park area.

The terms of the contract the Government has agreed with the winning bidder will deliver a series of improvements for passengers during the 29 month franchise.

These include providing better station and ticket facilities and measures to improve passenger information. A text messaging service to keep passengers informed if service disruption occurs will be introduced. New information desks will be provided at major stations including London Liverpool Street, Cambridge, Norwich, Ipswich and Stansted Airport.

The new franchise will make it easier for passengers to buy tickets, including:

  * extending Oyster Pay As You Go between London Liverpool Street and all stations to Shenfield, and stations to Hertford East 
  * improvements to ticket vending machines, and 
  * introducing mobile phone and print-at-home ticketing facilities.

Abellio Greater Anglia Limited has also committed to provide an additional 600 car park spaces (subject to planning approvals), more cycle storage facilities and deliver a number of other measures to improve the service to customers including deep cleaning of stations and trains.

The train company will take over station leases from Network Rail, taking on responsibility for all repairs and renewals at stations. This accords with the Government's overall franchise reform programme which advocates transfer of more responsibility for stations to train operators as the passenger-facing side of the rail industry.

To date, only overall figures for the performance of the franchise as a whole have been published. From the start of the new franchise, Abellio Greater Anglia Limited will start publishing a break down of punctuality figures by route giving passengers more transparency over the performance of the lines they use. The reliability requirements for the new franchise are also more demanding than the previous one.

When the franchise is renewed again in July 2014, the contract is expected to be 15 years in length. This forthcoming franchise will provide the opportunity to seek further improvements for passengers. We also intend to draw on the work of Sir Roy McNulty in setting the terms of the franchise with the aim of reducing costs and improving efficiency.

In May this year, the then Secretary of State announced that the next InterCity West Coast franchise would start on 9th December 2012. It was further announced that the Department intended to enter into negotiations with the incumbent franchisee (West Coast Trains Ltd and Virgin Rail Group) to secure affordable and value for money operations until the start of the new franchise.

I am pleased to announce that the Department has now agreed an extension with West Coast Trains Limited and Virgin Rail Group. This agreement will extend their current franchise on the InterCity West Coast route from 1 April 2012 until the start of the new franchise.

Over the course of the extension three new 600-seat Pendolino trains will be added to the line. This is in addition to the new Pendolino train which entered service in July of this year. Also, 31 of the existing Pendolino trains will be lengthened from 9 to 11 carriages, increasing the number of standard class seats on each train by almost 50%, from 320 to 470. In all, 106 new carriages are being introduced on the route making 28,000 extra seats available each day, an increase of 25%. This will relieve crowding on some of the busiest parts of the West Coast Main Line which is one the UK economy's most important transport corridors.

Virgin will also be responsible for providing important services enabling people travel by train to the Olympic and Paralympic Games next summer.

Road Safety Minister Mike Penning said:

> ""Britain has some of the safest roads in the world but we know how important it is to tackle the menace of drug driving.""
> 
> ""That is why we are putting together a panel of experts to give us advice on the technical aspects of introducing a new offence of driving with an illegal drug in your body. The panel will look at how such an offence could be defined as well as considering whether it is possible to set levels for the impairing effects of specific drugs.""

The Department's response to the North review made it clear that driving while impaired by drugs is as important an issue as drink-driving. It is now relatively easy to enforce the law against drink-driving, while the equally serious driving whilst impaired by drugs is more difficult to deal with effectively.

The Department said that it would examine the case for a new specific drug driving offence - alongside the existing one - which would relieve the need for the police to prove impairment case-by-case where a specified drug had been detected.

That is why the Department is putting together a panel of experts to give advice on the technical aspects of introducing a new offence of driving with an illegal drug in your body. The panel will look at how such an offence could be defined as well as considering whether it is possible to set levels for the impairing effects of specific drugs.

The panel's terms of reference are under development and are likely to be finalised when the panel has been fully assembled and starts work. This is expected to be in the Spring.

It is likely that the panel will consider whether it is possible to identify, for average members of the adult population, the levels of drugs that have an impairing effect broadly equivalent to the current blood alcohol level. They will consider this effect for a number of drugs including cocaine, MDMA, cannabis, and opiates.

In cases where such levels can be identified the panel may then look at how these would vary across the population, including for habitual users of these substances.

The panel will examine whether impairment levels could be exceeded through prescribed or otherwise legally obtained drugs as well as the effects of the interaction drugs and alcohol and of different combinations of drugs.

The expert panel will comprise academic and scientific experts in the field of alcohol and drug misuse and we are also working with colleagues from the Home Office and Department of Health.

The group's remit will be to provide scientific, evidence-based technical advice and not to provide policy or legal advice.

Highway authorities, mapping providers and satnav manufacturers are gathering at the Department for Transport after agreeing to the Minister's call to work more closely to ensure everything possible is done to make sure the right vehicles are on the right roads.

The summit is being chaired by the Association of Directors of Environment, Economy, Planning and Transportation (ADEPT) - which represents councils in transport - and ITS(UK) which promotes intelligent transport technology and whose membership includes satnav companies.

At present, it can take months for map updates to make their way from local councils to satnavs. As a result, drivers follow out-of-date maps and local residents end up with inappropriate traffic on their doorsteps. The summit will look at ways that satnavs can better reflect local conditions and whether they can unlock local authority information on parking availability or roadworks.

Local Transport Minister, Norman Baker, said:

> ""Out of date directions mean misdirected traffic - a scourge of local communities. I am pleased that highway authorities, mapping companies and satnav manufacturers have agreed to work more closely to provide drivers with accurate, up-to-date information on traffic restrictions such as narrow roads or low bridges.
> 
> ""The summit will see a plan of action agreed to ensure motorists are given the best possible directions and help prevent huge lorries from being sent down narrow country lanes and through small villages.
> 
> ""This is timely because from next month we are allowing local authorities to reclassify roads - ensuring A roads are placed where they want traffic to run and lowering the category of road in places they want traffic to avoid - rather than having to come to Whitehall for approval. These powers will help councils make sure that drivers are using suitable routes.""

Ministers are also tackling the misery caused by lorry drivers following satnavs down narrow and inappropriate roads as part of a package of new traffic signs rules.

Under the new rules councils will no longer need Whitehall approval to introduce certain new signs or some existing ones that they need to use on a regular basis - including one to warn lorry drivers of unsuitable roads.

### Further information

The Government is able to take a number of steps to minimise disruption, in particular to make sure the emergency services get the supplies they need.

Motorists can help by following the following sensible advice at this point, before there is a strike and when there is no problem with supply:

  * There is no need to queue at petrol forecourts.
  * There is no urgency to top up your tank.
  * Check travel sites and latest news before travelling.

A private Bill to make two private sector representatives nominated by the Humber Local Enterprise Partnership full voting members of board will be introduced later this year.

The Government wrote down the Humber Bridge debt by £150 million on 31 March and the bridge toll for cars was reduced from £3 to £1.50 on 1 April.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/stories/dft-news-20120615a,The changing face of disclosure and barring,"We know that good safeguarding practices should involve more than just a criminal record check, such as rigorous reference checking and face-to-face interviews, on-going training and day-to-day management.

While as an employer you are best placed to maintain safeguarding practice on the ground, from September 2012, the Government is scaling back the criminal records and barring systems to 'common sense' levels whilst ensuring that they continue to provide effective safeguarding. These changes will impact on organisations across England, Wales and Northern Ireland and it is important for employers to understand what the impact of these changes might be in their organisation.

The most important changes will be to reduce the numbers of people requiring criminal record checks by reducing Regulated Activity and scrapping Controlled Activity. This means that criminal records checks will only be mandatory for those working in close and unsupervised contact with vulnerable groups including children.

The Home Office has produced a [leaflet explaining these changes (PDF - 210 KB)](http://assets.dft.gov.uk/publications/changes/changes.pdf), as well as letting you know about other changes happening over the next six months.

At that time we undertook to consult on these proposals and today we have published that consultation.

Local Transport Minister Norman Baker said:

> ""Buses are the mainstay of our public transport system and can help to cut carbon and congestion. We want to take a fresh look at the way we fund buses so that more decisions affecting local services are being taken at a local level by people who know most about the needs of their communities.
> 
> ""That is why we are today launching a consultation on how best to implement the changes to the Bus Service Operators Grant system which we announced in March and ensure that funding is fair and fit for the future.
> 
> ""I hope that those parties with views and experience to share will find the time to read our proposals and have their say on how these changes should be made.""

Following the March announcement the Department for Transport set up working groups including local authorities and bus company representatives to look at the fine details of how these changes would work. This work has fed into the proposals which we are consulting on now. The consultation will run for eight weeks and can be found on the [department's website](http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/dft-2012-39/).

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/stories/dsa-news-20110328,Changes to the module one motorcycle test,"The government is working with the motorcycle industry to review the delivery and content of the motorcycle test. This working group includes DSA, DfT, the motorcycle training industry and motorcycle user groups.

This work (along with DSA's ongoing monitoring and review process of all tests) has identified a number of minor changes that can be quickly introduced before the main review is finished. 

The following provides you with an outline of the minor changes DSA intends to introduce to module one with effect from 16 May 2011.

* * *

## On this page:

  * Change to the sequence of the manoeuvres
  * Controlled stop
  * Emergency stop
  * Choosing preferred riding line
  * The slow ride
  * Altering requirements for the controlled stop following the avoidance exercise
  * Flexibility of speed assessment
  * Rider faults
  * Summary
  * Revised sequence of set exercises for module one of motorcycle test
  * Motorcycle manoeuvring area (MMA) diagrams

## Change to the sequence of the manoeuvres (see revised order below)

So that all the slow speed elements will be carried out before the higher speed exercises. This will allow candidates to demonstrate the necessary competence in motorcycle control before moving onto the more demanding manoeuvres.

Back to top

* * *

## Controlled stop

This provides an opportunity for candidates to ride the circuit bend of the motorcycle manoeuvring area before coming to a controlled stop. There will not be a minimum speed requirement to this manoeuvre which will allow the candidates the opportunity to familiarise themselves with the layout before moving on to the emergency stop.

Back to top

* * *

## Emergency stop

This is to take place before the avoidance exercise. If candidates fail the emergency stop they will not be permitted to carry out the avoidance exercise. This is so that only sufficiently prepared candidates will undertake the avoidance exercise.

Back to top

* * *

## Choosing preferred riding line

Re-position cones on the exit of both left and right hand bends to allow the rider to choose their preferred riding line. 

Back to top

* * *

## The slow ride

This will now be conducted whilst the candidate rides between the figure of eight and the U-turn manoeuvres. The examiner will observe rather than walk beside the candidate. This will make for a smoother transition from one manoeuvre to another whilst compensating for the extra time required for the candidate to benefit from the additional ride around the circuit bend.

Back to top

* * *

## Altering requirements for the controlled stop following the avoidance exercise

The requirements for the controlled stop following the avoidance exercise will be altered. The first pair of blue cones that currently form the stopping box will be removed for this exercise. The examiner will ask the candidate to stop between the remaining two blue cones. This will allow the candidate a greater length to stop in and also allows flexibility in where they stop. Candidates will still be required to stop under control.

Back to top

* * *

## Flexibility of speed assessment

For the high speed manoeuvres, those candidates who reach 47 km/h or less will be asked to repeat the exercise providing they haven't committed a serious or dangerous fault and providing their riding doesn't indicate it would be unsafe to continue. A rider fault will be assessed as the candidate hasn't achieved the minimum speed.

If the candidate fails to achieve the required minimum speed at the second attempt, a serious fault will be recorded.

Candidates who fail to reach the minimum speed requirement but who achieve 48 or 49 km/h won't be asked to repeat the exercise; a rider fault will be assessed in addition to any other control or observation faults. No more than one fault can be recorded for these exercises.

Candidates will still be required to stop under control.

(This section was updated on 13 June 2011)

Back to top

* * *

## Rider faults

The maximum number of rider faults a successful candidate is allowed will remain at five; the number of attempts allowed for the higher speed exercises will also remain unchanged. 

Back to top

* * *

## Summary

To summarise, these changes are designed to address those aspects the motorcycle industry felt needed to be changed.

The key message is that the exercises will remain the same; it is mainly the order in which they are delivered that will change. This will give candidates more time to settle down and familiarise themselves with the updated layout. This will also give them the opportunity to build up their speed gradually, reducing the risk of candidates riding too fast.

Back to top

* * *

## Revised sequence of set exercises for module one of motorcycle test

  * manual handling
  * slow control steering (slalom and figure of eight)
  * slow ride: this will be observed as the candidate rides to the next exercise
  * U-turn
  * circuit bend and controlled stop carried out between 30 km/h and 50 km/h (about 20 mph to 30 mph) followed by a controlled stop in the area marked by the four blue cones; speed not measured
  * cornering and emergency stop; speed measured
  * cornering, avoidance exercise and controlled stop; speed measured

",Driving Standards Agency,"Roads, Road safety",2011-03-28,,Story,Find out about minor changes that DSA is making to the motorcycle module one test from 16 May 2011.
http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/stories/dsa-news-20110420,Changes to the way motorcycle related incidents are reported,"From Monday 16 May, there will be some changes implemented by DSA to improve the way that motorcycle related incidents are recorded, reported and dealt with.

This mainly affects DSA staff processes but also amends existing approved training bodies' (ATBs) responsibilities.

This revised procedure should allow DSA to make sure the right level of support is given to those individuals involved in serious or major incidents. More robust recording will allow the agency to establish any lessons learned which could help to develop improvements to procedures in the future.

## What this will cover

It will cover a range of motorcycle activities including both off road and on road testing and training.

### Off-road incidents

For incidents taking place off road, during:

  * module one testing
  * ATB activities on an motorcycle manoeuvring area (MMA)
  * compulsory basic training (CBT) activity at an ATB site
  * direct access scheme (DAS) activity at an ATB site

### On-road incidents

For incidents taking place on road, during:

  * module two testing
  * any motorcycle incident involving a member of staff on DSA business
  * CBT training during element E
  * DAS training

The revised procedure does not cover training activities for register of post-test motorcycle training or enhanced rider scheme.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/stories/dsa-news-20110506,Unofficial driving test booking websites,"Directgov is the only official driving test booking website. 

Other websites offer driving test booking services, but might charge extra administrative fees on top of the Driving Standards Agency's (DSA) fee. Those websites are not run by or connected to DSA or Directgov. 

DSA recommends that all learner drivers book their driving test through the official booking service on Directgov by visiting [direct.gov.uk/drivingtest.](http://www.direct.gov.uk/drivingtest)

## If you have used an unofficial website

DSA gets complaints from customers who have used unofficial booking websites. In most cases these websites are doing nothing illegal. This means that DSA's powers to respond may be limited. 

If you have used an unofficial booking website, you might have seven working days to cancel your order and get all your money back. However, this will depend on the terms and conditions of the website you used. 

You can find more information about your consumer rights on Directgov. You can also use template letters to complain to businesses. Each letter includes details of the law that you want the trader to follow.

## What DSA is doing about unofficial booking websites

DSA takes consumer protection very seriously. So, DSA is: 

  * protecting its trademarks to make sure they are not: 
    * used to advertise unofficial booking sites in search engine results 
    * used as part of website addresses for unofficial booking websites 
  * asking the Advertising Standards Authority to make sure unofficial booking websites are following the rules in the UK Code of Non-broadcast Advertising, Sales Promotion and Direct Marketing 
  * asking local Trading Standards to investigate those unofficial booking websites that appear to be misleading consumers

## What DSA is doing to promote the official booking service

DSA makes improvements based on learner drivers' feedback to promote the official booking service. For example DSA: 

  * made sure that the official Directgov website pages appear at the top of search engine results where possible 
  * created videos showing how to use the practical test booking service - videos are being developed for the theory test booking service too 
  * reminded learner drivers on Twitter and Facebook about using the official booking service on Directgov 

## What approved driving instructors (ADIs) can do

DSA is encouraging ADIs to remind their trainees to use the official booking service by visiting **direct.gov.uk/drivingtest**. 

If ADIs run their own websites they can also link to the official booking service. The best links to put on your website are:

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/stories/dsa-news-20110616,DSA reminds motorcycle test candidates to wear suitable clothing,"DSA is reminding learner motorcyclists to wear suitable clothing when they take their module one and two motorcycle tests.

While most motorcycle trainers encourage their pupils to wear the best protective motorcycle gear that they can afford, some candidates aren't following this advice. 

DSA doesn't want to restrict candidates to wearing the most expensive protective motorcycle clothing. However, DSA's examiners won't ignore or condone riding a motorcycle or scooter while wearing unsuitable clothing.

## Tests won't go ahead if you are inappropriately dressed

From 1 July, examiners might tell you that your test won't go ahead if you arrive inappropriately dressed. However, where possible, examiners will give you the chance to find suitable clothing within the time available. 

DSA won't pay out-of-pocket expenses if your test is cancelled because of inappropriate clothing.

## Guide to suitable clothing

As a general guide the following is an indication of the minimum level of clothing acceptable:

  * motorcycle boots 
  * sturdy footwear or boots that provide support and ankle protection
  * textile or leather motorcycle trousers
  * heavy denim trousers
  * heavy denim jacket with several layers underneath
  * textile or leather motorcycle jacket
  * motorcycle gloves

The following are examples of clothing that are not acceptable:

  * lightweight training shoes
  * canvas basket ball trainers
  * any form of clothing with areas of exposed skin
  * shell suit or lightweight tracksuit
  * distressed ripped jeans
  * lightweight fleece or hoody
  * no gloves or skiing gloves

In all cases it's a legal requirement that riders wear an approved and correctly fastened motorcycle helmet,* with suitable eye protection (*an exception is made for members of the Sikh religion wearing a turban).

## Cases of inappropriate clothing

Recently there have been cases where candidates have arrived unsuitably dressed for the practical test. This has included wearing lightweight nylon shell suits, lightweight canvas training shoes, or wearing no gloves. 

One of these cases resulted in the test not going ahead.

## More advice and guidance

Clothing is one of the subjects covered in element A of compulsory basic training (CBT).

Further advice and guidance for candidates on the right clothing to wear can be found:

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/stories/dsa-news-20110617,DSA searches for casual hire sites for module one motorcycle test,"To improve access for those candidates who have to travel long distances to take the module one test, DSA is looking for additional casual hire sites in the following areas:

  * Mid Wales
  * East and West Yorkshire
  * Cumbria
  * Stoke-on-Trent

DSA may also consider other areas for casual hire sites, but this will depend on location and demand. If you're a driver or rider trainer who knows of any suitable sites ready to use, then DSA would like to hear from you.

Any sites you suggest must:

  * have suitable examiner accommodation, so will require office space and toilets as a minimum
  * be available for weekday or weekend use
  * have a surface with little or no work needed to bring up to a suitable standard, so it must: 
    * be relatively flat
    * have a good quality tarmac surface with no significant hazards near the riding line such as drains, kerbs, posts, potholes or other damage

DSA won't consider any sites where the surface isn't suitable; for example, if it's made up of concrete, gravel, or compressed hardcore.

On road access for module two isn't necessary. You could also consider areas where road markings or paint need to be removed.

## Motorcycle test module one site size options

### A standard area:

  * an area of 125 metres long and 40 metres wide 

### A hockey stick shaped layout:

This may become an option. DSA uses these at VOSA sites:

  * the short end of the hockey stick needs to be around 40 metres long by at least five metres wide
  * the straight should lead in to a 20 to 30 metre radius bend, travelling through at least 90 degrees
  * after the bend a straight section of approximately 100 metres long by at least 12 metres wide is required, there should be 35 metres (plus or minus four metres) from the exit of the bend to the two red cones at the start of the speed measuring channel 
  * an area of about 40 by 20 metres should be available for the slower speed exercises

There's some flexibility in the above dimensions as they may have to be varied to suit the local area. Please bear these options in mind when considering potential sites.
