Sir,

Contrary to suggestions in Alice Thomson's article (Opinion, Sept 28) the coalition Government is firmly committed to supporting our town centres. Our planning reforms actually safeguard a ""town centre first"" policy for new retail development to help to protect the high street. It states clearly that councils should recognise town centres as the heart of their communities and should pursue policies to allow them to thrive.

Strengthening our town centres goes hand-in-hand with reforms to make the planning system work in the interests of all our communities.

Alex Welsh should be reassured that strong planning protections will safeguard London's playing fields ('We need to safeguard London's playing fields or suffer the consequences', 6 October 2011).

Communities will have new powers to protect green spaces special to them thanks to a new Local Green Spaces designation which can be used to protect playing fields, allotments, community gardens and other recreational spaces. And we are increasing planning protections for valued community facilities to save them from unnecessary loss.

The Government is also maintaining protection for the Green Belt, and the Mayor and London Boroughs will continue to be able to safeguard Metropolitan Open Land.

The planning reforms ensure communities are central to deciding the areas they wish to see developed and those to be protected, through their Local Plan.  It is these plans that will drive planning decisions.

We desperately need to bring about new homes and jobs but this will not be at the expense of our green spaces.  Making sure people can go on enjoying their local amenities is at the heart of the changes.

Dear Sir

By lumping together statistics on the evictions of homeowners, social tenants and private tenants your article (March of the Bailiffs, Monday 30 January) painted an inaccurate and misleading representation, which overlooks how Government action is ensuring struggling households get the support they need.

The numbers of mortgage repossessions are expected to be lower than the Council of Mortgage Lenders' original forecast of 40,000 for 2011 - also lower than the rate inherited from the previous Government.

We are committed to ensuring real help, support and advice is available to help ensure that even in tough times repossession remains the last resort. We have taken decisive action to tackle the record deficit we inherited, preventing the need for rapid increases in interest rates that would have put a strain on family budgets. We've maintained £400million preventing homelessness funding and put a further £200million towards the Mortgage Rescue Scheme.

I would urge anyone struggling to pay their mortgage to seek help as early as possible. The Directgov website as well as organisations such as Citizens Advice, Shelter and National Debtline are on hand to offer the advice and information that can help put people in the best possible position to keep their homes.

This follows constructive engagement with representatives of all four firefighter unions.

The Government pays tribute to the importance of the work undertaken by our fire and rescue service and the bravery, dedication and professionalism of the men and women who work in it. The Government is committed to providing public service pensions that are sustainable, fair and effective.

Building on the proposals brought forward by Lord Hutton, these proposals aim to strike a balanced deal between public service workers and the taxpayer. They will ensure that public service workers continue to have access to good pensions, while taxpayers benefit from greater control over their costs.

The Heads of Agreement presents a fair and affordable long-term reform package that means firefighters will look to their future retirement with certainty and with a pension to reflect their valuable years of service.

Public sector pensions will remain among the very best available - a guaranteed level and inflation proofed. Only 1 in 10 private sector workers have access to such schemes.'

This Heads of Agreement sets out the main elements of a scheme design that will form the basis for ongoing discussions about reforms to be introduced from 2015. Trades unions have agreed to take this package to their Executives and, if appropriate, their membership for further consideration.

Further discussions on the remaining detail will take place over the coming weeks.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/housing/1722128,Grant Shapps: Communities should prepare for their Right to Build,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today announced that local rural housing projects that secure the support of 75 per cent of voters will get the go-ahead without the need for a specific application for planning permission.

This is the next step in bringing forward a Community Right to Build, which will move power from Whitehall to residents to give the green light to new developments that have overwhelming local support and meet minimum planning criteria.

The Minister today urged rural communities to work together to prepare for this new Right to Build, and examine how it can be used to deliver the homes their areas need.

The Government had initially proposed a higher 90 per cent threshold for local Right to Build approval, but it was soon clear that there was a strong preference for a lower threshold across the board.

Mr Shapps believes this new support threshold strikes the right balance - enabling communities to bring forward the development they want while still ensuring that developments are supported by the overwhelming majority of the wider community.

The shift in power through Community Right to Build from Government to communities will be included in the forthcoming Localism Bill, to be introduced later this autumn. It will mean local people can deliver the homes they really want, rather than being told their own expansion doesn't fit in with the local council's plans and therefore cannot go ahead.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""No-one knows the challenges that rural communities face better than the people who live there. I want to give them the power and the freedom to tackle local issues with local solutions through the Community Right to Build, so they can give the go-ahead to the new homes their area needs.
> 
> ""That's why new Community Right to Build organisations will not need to make specific planning applications for new developments. Those plans that get 75 per cent support in local referendums will no longer need to go to the Town Hall for approval - instead, work can begin much more quickly.
> 
> ""I've listened to the views of the public that responded strongly to our consultation, and I believe this threshold strikes the right balance between enabling communities to go ahead with their plans for expansion, while at the same time ensuring the support of the overwhelming majority of the wider community. And I hope it gives rural towns and villages across the country the prompt they need to prepare for a new Right to Build as a solution to the housing challenges they face.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/housing/1766308,Grant Shapps: New common sense code to build greener homes,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today published an improved green rating for new homes that will help deliver the next generation of green properties, which are built to the highest standards of sustainable design, and could reduce future utility bills by up to £2,250 a year in the most energy efficient homes.

The Code for Sustainable Homes was introduced in April 2007 as a standard to improve the overall sustainability of new homes. The Code scores against a star rating system, using one to six stars depending on how the property performs against categories such as energy use, waste, materials and water.

Mr Shapps said the Code has been updated to take into account the tougher new rules for energy efficiency in buildings, and help developers make new homes greener without getting bogged down in unnecessary 'gold plated' design features.

The Code, which has been updated after an extensive consultation with housebuilders and industry experts, will also make it easier for consumers and homeowners who want to grade the standard of their properties.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""Over a quarter of the country's carbon emissions come from our homes, and if we're serious about tackling climate change we need to reduce this. So I welcome these changes to the Code that bring it in line with the tough new rules for energy efficiency in the Building Regulations.
> 
> ""We need greener homes, but I also want to make it easier to build the homes this country needs. Good building standards can only be effective if they are easy to understand, and only applied where they are appropriate. That's why the Code has been updated to iron out problems that have arisen over time, and streamlined so building standards can be used in a sensible way that suits the local situation.
> 
> ""It's important house builders meet the standards local communities demand, but I'm determined to simplify the complicated processes they have to go through to achieve this. That's why I've pledged to tackle the 'alphabet soup' of standards and red tape that blight efforts to start new developments, and I will be working with industry to get this done.""

The Code is rated from one to six, one being the entry level - above the level of the standard, mandatory Building Regulations - and six as highest, reflecting outstanding sustainable development.

In the first three years, nearly 8,000 homes have been completed to Code level standards. Ministers believe this figure is too low, partly because the current Code is too complicated and bureaucratic. The updated version will be a first step towards making it is easier for developers to deliver more green homes. The new Code's green rating system has been improved by:

  * **Aligning the Code with the latest developments in building regulations** - it will now take into account, and in some cases go beyond, the tougher new Building Regulations to reduce carbon emissions from buildings. For example, a Code level 4 home will now be 25 per cent above this minimum standard. The new Code will also strongly incentivise the introduction of 'fabric energy efficiency standards', so developers can use building materials and techniques that improve the energy efficiency of new homes.

  * **Streamlining the Code and associated processes** - to ensure that the Code is focused on the issues of greatest significance, instead of including unnecessary standards that duplicate existing regulations or create difficulties for developers. For example, there is now an exemption from the 'lifetime homes' standards for sites where it is too steep to apply, and the mandatory requirement for site waste management plans has been removed since it is required by other regulations.

  * **Resolving problems that have arisen in use of the Code** - for example, clarifying parts of the Code that set standards for reducing the risk of flooding. Clear surface water management standards have now been set, enabling developers to understand exactly what is required.

The new Code will have key role in helping people cut their carbon emissions and lead more sustainable lifestyles. The standards reflect the future goals for zero carbon homes and include measures for reducing energy consumption, minimising and recycling waste, reducing potable water demand, reducing the risk and impact of flooding, reducing carbon intensive travel by providing cycle storage as well as promoting facilities for working at home. It encourages a reduction in energy through the choice of building materials as well as the energy used during the construction.

### Notes to editors

1. The Code is a voluntary standard with flexibility for developers to determine the most cost-effective mix of issues to cover to achieve any particular level, subject to a limited number of mandatory requirements to secure particular Code levels. However, it is also used as a condition by local authorities when they want to set sustainability-based planning conditions on housing developments in their area. However, before setting such a condition, planning guidance (PPS1 Supplementary Guide) currently requires authorities to undertake a full viability assessment setting out the costs to industry, and the benefits. The new Code and technical guide can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/codeguidesummary2010.](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/codeguidesummary2010)

2. Compared to the current version of the Code, the changes being introduced today could result in an overall net present value benefit to the UK economy of nearly £110m. Full details are available in the Impact Assessment which is also being published today at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/codeimpactassessment2010.](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/codeimpactassessment2010)

3. A major potential saving for developers has been made by making requirements over rainwater management more sensitive, which was proposed by many developers. This, in conjunction with other measures, could reduce the cost of constructing Code homes by up to £50m, depending on the location.

4. Average savings for householders on utility bills are set out below. In 2010, taking into account feed in tariffs, households built to Code level 6 could save between £1250 for a flat and up to £2250 for a detached house in energy and water bills.

Annual Fuel bill and feed-in tariff revenue relative to a Part L compliant home in 2010  
  
  
  


5. Practical experience of working with the Code is also informing the development of other aspects of sustainability policy. For example the development of surface water management proposals in the current Floods and Water Management Bill.

6. The Government is committed to reduce the burden of regulation, and to reducing duplication. Future plans to review the future role of the Code are currently being considered, alongside a wider rationalisation of housing standards.

7. The rating standards in the Code are assessed against nine categories:

  * Pollution
  * Heath and Wellbeing
  * Management
  * Ecology
  * Energy and CO2 Emissions
  * Water
  * Materials
  * Surface Water Run-off
  * Waste

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/housing/1768247,Grant Shapps: Rewards for homes with the New Homes Bonus,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today pledged cash for communities who allow new homes to be built in their area. Almost £1bn Government funding has been set aside for councils that welcome new housing development, which they will be able to spend to benefit their local community.

In proposals published for consultation, the Minister has announced that the Government will match the council tax raised from new homes for the first six years through the New Homes Bonus. Councils and communities will work together to decide how to spend the extra funding - whether council tax discounts for local residents, boosting frontline services like rubbish collection or providing local facilities like swimming pools and leisure centres.

Mr Shapps said councils who have already set out their stall for growth are building up rewards for their local area, and all homes that are built now will benefit from the new funding. Councils will also receive a higher level of funding for building new affordable homes.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""We are ending the system where the Government can tell communities what and where to build - that top-down approach slowed housebuilding to a trickle, so we need to take action now to get the country building again. That's why we've set aside almost £1bn so councils who build more homes start benefiting immediately from the extra cash, which they can spend on improving the local area.
> 
> ""For too long communities have fought against development because they can't see how it does anything to improve their lives. I'm determined to change this. The New Homes Bonus will ensure that those communities that go for growth reap the benefits of development, not just the costs.
> 
> ""Councillors will now be able to lead a mature debate about the benefits of development. And rather than being punished for not meeting targets, local communities will now have a reason to say yes to new homes, because they will benefit from better local services, or perhaps the redevelopment of their town centre in return for backing new housing.""

Executive Chairman of the Home Builders Federation, Stewart Baseley said:

> ""The country is facing an acute housing crisis and it is imperative we have a planning system that delivers sufficient land for the homes we need. The New Homes Bonus is an essential part of the new incentive based structure and we welcome the commitment to a simple, easy to understand system.""

Councils will benefit from a higher level of funding for encouraging new affordable homes to be built in the local area, with council tax matched and then supplemented by £350 per home each year for six years. Today's announcement follows the Government's commitment to invest £4.5bn in affordable housing over the next four years, which will deliver up to 155,000 new affordable homes.

MS Word, 25 kb, 2 pages

### Notes to editors

1. The consultation on the New Homes Bonus seeks views on the implementation of a powerful, simple and transparent system for incentivising local authorities to increase their housing supply. This follows the Coalition Agreement to provide incentives for local authorities to deliver sustainable development, including for new homes and businesses. A copy of the consultation can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/newhomesbonusconsult](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/newhomesbonusconsult).

2. The long-term demand for housing is strong. Despite this, housing development has consistently fallen over the last decade. On average 26,000 fewer homes were built each year from 1997 to 2009, and in 2009 there were just 118,000 completions, the lowest level of house building in peacetime since 1924.

3. The previous Government tried to remedy falling levels of housebuilding by using centrally determined housing targets that local authorities and communities had to meet. These failed to deliver the housing this country needs. The Housing and Planning Delivery Grant (HPDG) that was introduced to support targets and improve housing delivery was ineffective and complicated, and local authorities could not rely on it as a sufficient and stable incentive.

4. A series of recent independent reviews by Sir Michael Lyons, Kate Barker and Professor Michael Ball highlighted the powerful role that local incentives could play in driving housing delivery. The current local government finance system does not provide the right incentive or rewards for councils to build new homes or bring long term empty properties back into use. If a local authority promotes the building of homes in the area it governs, little of the economic gain is captured by the local community. As a result existing residents see only further strain on public services and reduced amenity when new homes are built.

5. The proposed scheme will provide this incentive and return power back to local communities. £900m has been set aside to get the scheme up and running. Decisions on where and how housing development occurs will rest locally and ensure that the benefits of growth are returned to communities.

6. £946m has been set aside over the Spending Review period. In 2011-12 this is almost £200m and £250m in each of the remaining years. Funding beyond these levels will come from Formula Grant.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,12 November 2010
http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/housing/1795391,Grant Shapps: Next steps in delivering a better deal for council house tenants,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today announced the steps Government will take to overhaul the complex system of council house finance and return financial control to councils themselves - enabling them to offer a better deal to England's four million council tenants.

Today's route map to deliver a more transparent and accountable system of council house financing that places councils firmly in the driving seat is part of the Government's wider programme of devolving more financial freedom to councils.

As part of this Mr Shapps announced an extra £116million funding allocated each year for councils to pay for disabled adaptations to homes and an extra half a billion per year for councils to spend on their stock. He said that these reforms will ensure councils can plan effectively for the long term - enabling them to unlock over £6 billion estimated efficiency savings over 30 years which they will be able to plough into new investment.

Following the review announced in the Coalition Agreement, Ministers announced in October that they would replace the Housing Revenue Account subsidy system where councils are required to pay council house rents to Whitehall which decided how best to redistribute it. This meant that councils had no certainty about future income, no ability to plan long term and little incentive to be more efficient.

This opaque, centralised system will be replaced with one that provides a direct link between the rents councils charge, the money they spend, and the services they deliver. This means tenants and local taxpayers will be able to hold their landlord to account for the cost and quality of their housing. This will be achieved via a reallocation of housing debt after which councils will retain all the rental income they collect.

The Localism Bill, to be published today, will include measures to repeal the existing subsidy system and replace it with powers for the Secretary of State to introduce self-financing. Subject to Parliamentary approval these changes will begin in April 2012. The current system will continue to run during 2011/12.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""For far too long, councils have been frustrated in their efforts to meet the housing needs of their tenants by a discredited system for financing council housing. Our new approach will devolve power and sufficient resources to councils to enable them to offer a better service to tenants. And tenants and local taxpayers will be able to hold their landlord to account for the cost and quality of their housing.
> 
> ""Today I am setting out the steps we will take to deliver this more transparent and accountable system fairly and openly based on accurate valuations. These reforms are part of our wide-ranging programme of pushing power away from Whitehall to town halls and local areas. We estimate that by putting councils firmly in control of council house finance they can unlock over £6 billion of efficiency savings which they will be able to plough into new investment.
> 
> ""We are committed to helping the most vulnerable people in our communities so as part of this deal I am pleased to announce an extra £116 million a year to help councils prioritise adaptations for disabled residents. This will make a huge difference to thousands of people across the country - in many cases ensuring they can continue to live independent lives. We are also correcting decades of under-funding in the sector by providing around half a £ billion of extra funding for councils to spend on their stock each year.""

### Notes for editors

1. The precise details of the self-financing settlement will continue to be finalised over the next year to ensure they take account of any relevant changes in economic circumstances - for example up to date valuations of each councils housing stock. Government will then confirm that the settlement is fair and sustainable and should be implemented in 2012 (subject to Parliamentary approval).

2. The method for calculating the debt reallocation will be based on a 30 year notional business plan of income and expenditure for each landlord. A payment to or from each council will then be made to reflect the difference between the value of the business and the housing debt currently supported under the HRA. Income assumptions built into the valuation will be based on the existing social rent policy for councils that that their rents should converge with standard housing association rents in 2015/16.

3. How these reforms will work in practice, together with the underpinning model including updated indicative numbers per council will be set out in a policy document in the New Year. This will also set out the updated methodology in more detail and will incorporate the following parameters:

  * a discount rate of 6.5 per cent for calculating the net present value of each council's housing business;
  * providing for realistic expenditure for management, maintenance and major repairs as identified in independent research published last year, increasing the costs used in the valuation by an average of 11.7 per cent;
  * £116 million of extra funding each year for councils to pay for disabled adaptations to their stock;
  * funding for Treasury Management costs and to reflect planned demolitions;
  * Government continuing to pay subsidy to local authorities for the PFI schemes currently funded through the HRA;
  * 75 per cent of net receipts from any Right-to-Buy sales continuing to be returned to the Exchequer. Estimates of the loss of income from RTB sales will be built into the valuation of each council's housing business. Receipts from other disposals will continue to be held locally to spend on affordable housing or regeneration; and
  * Council landlords being subject to a cap on overall housing borrowing for each local authority. This cap will be linked to the opening debt level under self-financing.

4. Using today's figures, economic assumptions and these parameters, the net receipt to the Exchequer from these transactions is projected at approximately £6.5 billion. These will be updated in the model issued alongside the policy document expected in the New Year and before the implementation of self-financing using the latest data and economic assumptions.

5. This projected receipt includes £1.2 billion attributable to the decision to continue funding PFI separately. Local authorities with PFI schemes will share this extra amount but will continue to receive subsidy. This was the option preferred by all local authorities with PFI schemes.

In 2006, the previous Government introduced 'Empty Dwelling Management Orders'. They allow councils to take over properties that have been empty for as little as six months.

  * the home does not have to be blighted or boarded up to be taken over, just empty for six months - including homes of the deceased
  * councils have the right to seize furniture, fixtures and fittings, when the home is taken over, including where the home has been left empty for a period after the owner has died
  * homes already on the property market can be seized if councils believe the asking price is ""unrealistic"".

In order to protect civil liberties, Mr Pickles is today introducing powerful safeguards to restrict the use of Empty Dwelling Management Orders.

  * they will be limited to empty properties that have become magnets for vandalism, squatters and other forms of anti-social behaviour - blighting the local neighbourhood
  * a property will have to stand empty for at least two years before an Empty Dwelling Management Order can be obtained, and property owners will have to be given at least three months' notice before the order can be issued.

Mr Pickles is concerned that councils have used the Orders to instigate action against homeowners that is inappropriate, including against people in vulnerable situations. Councils have, for example, attempted to use the powers against a homeowner whilst she was caring for her injured daughter in France; to take over an Order being used against the house of a 96 year old as soon as he passed away in a nursing home; and against a divorcee, who faced action because he only lived in the property at weekends to visit his estranged children.

These new safeguards will ensure that responsible homeowners do not face having their properties seized. Mr Pickles said it is wrong that a bereaved family could face having their loved one's home seized for a period if there is a delay in them deciding what to do with it.

The move comes as the Government prepares to introduce wider plans to bring back into use many of the 300,000 properties in England that have been empty for a long period of time.

From next year, councils will have a new incentive to bring empty properties back into use through a New Homes Bonus, under which the Government will match the council tax raised from any council tax collected from a property that previously stood empty.

Communities and Local Government Secretary, Eric Pickles, said:

> ""There is a case for action to put boarded-up and blighted properties back into use. But these draconian and heavy-handed state powers have allowed councils to seize private homes in perfect condition, including their fixtures and fittings, just because the homes have been empty for a short while.
> 
> ""The Coalition Government is standing up for the civil liberties of law-abiding citizens. Fundamental human rights include the right to property. People suffering the loss of a loved one should not have to endure the added indignity of having their home seized because of a delay in them deciding what to do with it.
> 
> ""That's why the new Government is introducing new safeguards that mean the rights of responsible homeowners will be protected, while allowing action to be taken against genuine derelict buildings which blight neighbourhoods.""

### Notes to editors

1. The Government will use secondary legislation to introduce safeguards that restrict the use of Empty Dwelling Management Orders 2006, and will be engaging with interested parties on the extent of the changes.

2. In 2006, the previous Government introduced new 'Empty Dwelling Management Orders' (EDMO) that give town halls the power to take over the management of private homes which have been empty for as little as six months.

  * There are two types of EDMO - an interim EDMO which lasts for a year during which time the local authority must try to work with the owner to get the property back into use. If no agreement is reached the local authority can make a final EDMO which can last for up to seven years.

  * The home does not have to be run down or uninhabitable to be seized, merely empty for six months.

  * Homes of the deceased can be confiscated for up to seven years, even if inheritance issues are not yet finalised. The regulations allow for the home of a deceased person to be seized at any point after six months from the 'grant of representation' (the proof of legal authority allowing a personal representative to start administering an estate).

  * The council is not obliged to obtain a market rent, but in most cases can still deduct all their running costs from the rent.

  * Tenants in the home still have contractual and legal rights of occupancy, making it more difficult to return the property to the owner if the Order is revoked.

3. In guidance issued in 2009, the previous Government called for local authorities to make use of these powers. The guidance can be found at [http://www.emptyhomes.com/usefulresources/edmos.html](http://www.emptyhomes.com/usefulresources/edmos.html).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/housing/1813451,New incentives to tackle the blight of empty homes,"Communities Minister Andrew Stunell has set out how local people can bring back into use empty homes that attract anti-social behaviour and cause misery for neighbours.

The Government is offering powerful new incentives for councils to get empty homes lived in again, matching the council tax raised for every empty property brought back into use - which can be spent as they wish. Mr Stunell urged local communities to work with their council to identify where empty homes are blighting the neighbourhood, and start benefiting from extra cash that can be used to improve the local area.

There are around 300,000 long term empty properties across England. They can easily fall into disrepair, attracting squatters, vandalism and anti-social behaviour, bringing down the neighbourhood. So Mr Stunell is calling on residents to come forward and point out these properties to their local council so action can be taken to tackle the problem.

Under plans recently consulted on, the Government will match through the New Homes Bonus any council tax raised from a property that previously stood empty. The extra funding can be spent to benefit the local community - whether on council tax discounts, boosting local services, renovating more empty properties or improving local facilities.

The funding is part of a two pronged attack to get to grips with the issue of empty homes, and will supplement the £100 million already announced as part of the Spending Review for Housing Associations to bring empty properties back into use.

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""Long-term empty properties easily fall into disrepair, and attract the squatters, vandalism and anti-social behaviour that bring down our local neighbourhoods. With as many as 300,000 long-term empty properties across the UK this precious resource is being squandered.
> 
> ""Empty properties should instead be treated as an asset and brought back into use for those families that need somewhere to live.
> 
> ""That's why we're giving local councils powerful new incentives to tackle the problem. The Coalition government is pledging to match the council tax raised for every property brought back into use to help these properties become homes for thousands of families in need.
> 
> ""It's vital that local communities, councils and owners of empty properties work together to bring properties back into use and begin to tackle this problem that is blighting our local communities.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/housing/1829922,Social landlords ready to pass down people power,"Housing associations will have an increasingly prominent role in helping local people to take control of their neighbourhoods, Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark said.

Mr Clark said the founding ethos of housing associations was about helping local people to come together to improve their communities.

In a major speech to the National Housing Federation, Mr Clark said associations were a perfect example of the type of grass roots organisations who show that the principles of local control can take root in all communities.

The Localism Bill is all about putting power into the hands of local people, and housing associations will be well placed to use their expertise and relationships to encourage and enable people to act on new freedoms, Mr Clark said.

Mr Clark added that the new rights and opportunities in the Bill to exercise power should in no way be seen as confined to ""well off communities"", and it was patronising to suggest that some people, depending on their background or walk of life, were not capable of making good decisions for themselves and their neighbourhood.

Mr Clark said:

> ""The best housing associations have been embodiments of localism for many years. They engage with their tenants and their communities every day in hundreds of different ways beyond providing high quality accommodation, to being closely involved in the life of their communities.
> 
> ""They are the perfect example of the kind of grass roots organisations who show that the principles of local control can take root in deprived areas as well as well-heeled ones.
> 
> ""The Housing Association movement shows that with the right help, every community can be empowered to express itself and help shape their areas.""

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,31 January 2011
http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/housing/1831664,Grant Shapps - new financial deal for council housing,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has fired the starting gun on a council housing revolution that for the first time puts councils and communities in control - allowing them to make long term plans to offer a better deal to England's four million council tenants.

Under this new localist approach councils will have the tools and incentives to more effectively manage their housing stock over the long term, they will be free to make their own decisions about housing assets and through greater transparency tenants and local taxpayers will be better placed to hold their landlord to account.

The Minister today published details of the new financial deal for council housing - a key measure of the Localism Bill currently before Parliament. This includes a detailed description of how each council's opening financial position will be determined and the process for implementing these reforms in April 2012. By providing councils with clarity on funding for the future they can now begin detailed preparations on how they plan to better meet the housing needs of their communities over the long term.

This new approach, developed in partnership with local government, will bring an end to the Housing Revenue Account subsidy system where councils were required to pay council rents to Whitehall which decided how to redistribute it meaning they had no certainty about future income, no ability to plan long term and little incentive to be more efficient.

The new self-financing approach puts councils firmly in control with the tools and incentives they need to manage their housing stock over the long term rather than on a year by year basis. This will be achieved by a one-off adjustment to each council's housing debt after which councils will retain all the rental income they collect. And they will be free to make decisions about their housing assets without first having to get permission from Ministers in Whitehall.

By introducing a direct link between rents councils charge, the money they spend and the services they deliver tenants and local tax payers will be better able to hold their landlords to account. Councils will now for the first time be able to make information about how money is raised and spent publicly available in an easily accessible format. This will include how landlords are improving value for money to their tenants and local tax payers.

The deal includes an extra half a billion per year for councils to spend on their housing stock and extra £116 million funding for councils to pay for disabled adaptations to homes. In total, funding for management, maintenance, repairs and adaptations under the new approach will be 14 per cent higher than under the current subsidy system.

The Localism Bill, that begins its Committee Stage in the House of Commons today, 1 February 2011, includes these measures to repeal the existing subsidy system and replace it with powers for the Secretary of State to introduce self-financing.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""This deal brings to an end a centralised system which meant councils didn't know what funding they would get for housing from one year to the next and were unable to take key decisions about their housing stock. It prevented them from delivering the best possible services for their tenants in the most efficient way.
> 
> ""I am setting councils free to better meet the needs of their tenants. Today I am outlining these new freedoms as well as how each council's opening financial position will be calculated. By giving them clarity on their future revenue and the freedom they have to decide what is best in their local area they can now start preparing for this council house revolution that will begin next year. They now have the tools and incentives to radically overhaul the housing services they provide and deliver better value for money.
> 
> ""And by putting councils in control and making the decisions they take more transparent tenants and local tax payers will be better placed to hold their landlords to account.""

### Notes for editors

#### Introduction

The department has published a policy document on the future financial arrangements for council housing entitled 'Implementing Self-financing'. This is accompanied by:

i. A model which applies the settlement methodology to local authority data to provide indicative figures per council  
ii. A user guide to accompany this model  
iii. A report on the model inputs, assumptions and outputs

These reforms only have implications for each stock-retaining local authority's ring-fenced Housing Revenue Account, and will not impact on their general finances, or on other local authorities. Chapter 5 of 'Implementing Self-financing' has more information on the arrangements which keep money for housing separate from money spent on other services.

Abolition of the subsidy system does not end the requirement for local authorities to maintain a statutory, ring-fenced Housing Revenue Account. Local authorities will still be required to account to their tenants for income from and expenditure to council housing separately from income and spending on other functions and services. This ensures that council taxpayers do not subsidise services specifically for the benefit of tenants and that rent is not used to subsidise functions which are for the benefit of the wider local community.

#### The overall methodology

Valuations will be based on assumptions about each local authority's income and need to spend over 30 years. Assumptions about income will follow from the Government's social rent policy. The assumptions about expenditure needs will reflect evidence commissioned by Government in 2009 and 2010 about the costs of managing, maintaining and repairing the stock. This 30-year cash flow of income and expenditure will then be converted into a capital sum using standard discounted cash flow techniques.

The self-financing valuation will assume that local authorities will follow national social rent policy, which comprises a number of different components:

(i) A 'formula rent' for each property, based on property values, property size and local earnings. Over time, all social landlords are expected to move their rents in line with this formula. At present most housing associations set rents at or close to the formula level, but council rents were on average approximately 8 per cent below this in 2010/11.

(ii) A 'guideline rent' which converges with the formula rent by 2015/16. The valuation will assume convergence with formula rents by 2015/16, followed by rental increase of just above inflation year on year - set at the Retail Price Index + 0.5 per cent per annum.

(iii) A limit on individual rent rises of RPI + 0.5 per cent + £2 each year. This cap prevents excessively high increases in the rents of individual properties as they are moved over time to the formula rent. An estimate will be made for each landlord about the number of tenants whose rents could not move to the formula by 2015/16 without breaching this element of rent policy. The assumed income in the valuation will be reduced by this amount.

The spending needs built into the valuation are based on independent research about actual unit costs (by BRE, HQN and PwC) which are significantly higher than those under the present subsidy system. This approach to costs will give all local authorities more money to spend on managing, maintaining and repairing their stock than under the current system. In aggregate this works out at an increase to £545 million per year for 30 years or a national average Major Repairs Allowance of £956 per dwelling per year and average management and maintenance allowances of £2,061 per dwelling per year.

The assumed rents and costs will be used to produce a notional 30 year business plan of income and expenditure for each local authority landlord's business. This will be converted into a stock valuation using standard discounted cash flow principles, using a 6.5 per cent discount rate.

In order to calculate the payment to or from Government, the valuation will be compared with the notional amount of housing debt supported by Housing Revenue Account subsidy. If the valuation is higher than this assumed debt figure, the local authority will be required to pay Government the difference. If the valuation is lower, the Government will pay the difference to the local authority. Payments from central Government will in most cases not go to local authorities directly, but will be used to redeem debt held by the local authority.

#### The key figure

The key national figures are:

  * the estimated aggregate value of local authorities' housing businesses in 2012 at a discount rate of 6.5 per cent is £28.138 billion
  * the forecast for national Housing Revenue Account debt at April 2012 is £21,428 billion
  * the forecast receipt to the Exchequer is £6.711 billion.

For more information on these national figures including how the valuation, debt levels and receipt have altered since the figures published in March 2010 consultation see Annex A of 'Implementing Self-financing'.

#### The existing system

The existing subsidy system will continue unchanged for 2011/12.  Arrangements for this year are contained in 'Implementing Self-financing'.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/housing/1845046,Grant Shapps: More help on the way for first time buyers,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today called on key players in the housing industry to work more closely together to help aspiring first time buyers get a foot on the property ladder.

Leading industry figures representing house builders, lenders, insurers, councils and consumer groups attended a summit today held by Mr Shapps, to discuss how they could step up their efforts to help young people who aspire to own their own home.

Ministers called the meeting so there could be a frank and open discussion about all the issues. Practical work that will now be taken forward includes:

  * working with homebuilders and lenders to understand the current barriers to the availability of mortgages, and encouraging them to devise new mortgage products that address the challenges faced by first time buyers - such as innovative schemes for parents to support their children into home ownership - for example, the Lloyds Lend a Hand scheme or the Hitachi loan deal, or the new mortgage guarantee scheme launched today by Taylor Wimpey
  * increasing new and creative local approaches to shared ownership or equity loans - there are a number of providers looking to expand or facilitate the expansion of the shared ownership or equity loan provision; and
  * exploring the barriers to the take-up of mortgage insurance, and looking at the role of mortgage indemnity guarantees for increasing lending to first time buyers.

A key issue to emerge from the meeting is that there is a communication problem between different sectors of the housing industry. Mr Shapps said better communication within the housing industry, including building on the work of the Home Finance Forum, would be vital to helping first time buyers.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""I called on key figures from across industry to come together today, because we must do more to help aspiring first time buyers - the average age of the first time buyer with no support from their family is now 37, and there are 1.4 million households who aspire to own a home but are simply unable to do so because of house prices and mortgage availability.
> 
> ""I wanted to hear a first hand account of the problems the sector faces, but I also wanted to knock heads together so the needs of young people who want to buy a home are put first. The Government is working with industry to improve the availability of mortgages - but there also needs to be a much more unified effort from across the board to work together, so we can ensure that young people are not locked out of the housing market.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/housing/1882271,Tenant Cashback set to reward house proud council tenants,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today offered tenants a Cashback deal worth billions to take control of their own homes.

Launching Tenant Cashback, Mr Shapps said there are millions of social housing tenants who take great pride in looking after their homes - and that he thinks ""it's about time we make it worthwhile for many more tenants to show this kind of responsibility"".

Social housing landlords responsible for England's more than 4 million social homes spend an average of £1000 per property annually on repairs - maintenance that tenants could, very often, do themselves, saving landlords money in the process.

Tenant Cashback will allow residents to take more control of their repairs budgets for their homes, for example carry out their own DIY, or commission it locally and pocket any savings made. Cash they could use however they want - for example, towards a deposit on their own house.

With maintenance and repair costing £4billion a year, the move could see a bonanza for small businesses - local painters, plumbers or carpenters - as more of the money is spent locally.

Community groups will also be able to take on the repairs on a particular street or neighbourhood, helping out those who cannot take on the responsibility themselves. Tenants will be able to pool their resources, creating a 'Community Cashback' account which could be used to fund improvements to the local area for the benefit of all residents.

The Government wants all landlords to offer their tenants the chance to manage more of their repairs budgets - and will consult on bringing forward changes to regulations to give all tenants the option to request it from their landlord.

But no tenant will be obliged to take on any more responsibility than they choose and the scheme won't place any new cap on maintenance budgets.

Greater involvement of tenants can only be a good thing for landlords too - who look to benefit from cutting out routine tasks that cost them a lot in administrative time and money. Good landlords also see the benefits from encouraging more tenants to stand on their own two feet, and to work closely with their neighbours and wider community.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Social housing should act as a springboard to help people make better lives for themselves. When residents take pride in their homes it saves their landlords cash, so I think it's right that tenants should benefit too.
> 
> ""Tenant Cashback will do just that, giving house-proud residents more control over looking after their own homes. Doing your own DIY or choosing a local handyman to do the work - will allow tenants to pocket any savings they make.
> 
> ""And if house proud tenants drive down the total cost of maintenance then this could lead to tenants receiving cheques in the post worth thousands of pounds, for them to use however they wish.""

### Notes to editors

Mark Henderson, Chief Executive, Home Group - one of the country's largest social landlords, managing 52,000 homes, said:

> ""We believe this scheme offers a real chance for customers to take responsibility for the upkeep of their homes and neighbourhoods, while making savings and potentially gaining practical and transferable employment skills. It is certainly a proposal that could radically change the way organisations like ours operate and rewarding customers for taking on aspects of maintenance is an idea which we have for some time agreed merits exploration. For this reason, we are happy to pilot the scheme and help assess what benefits it could deliver for our customers.""

Sue Chalkley, Chief Executive of Hastoe Housing Association - a landlord of over 4000 properties, commented:

> ""This initiative fits well with our strategy to find new ways of providing value for money and, with our combination of a young resident profile, low turnover and local community strategies; we are expecting the pilot to be a success. I am sure there are residents who will welcome this opportunity to work with us to keep their homes in good repair.""

Green Vale Homes, who manage 3700 homes, said:

> ""Green Vale Homes, alongside our partner organisations within the Together Housing Group, welcome the opportunity to develop the tenant cash back idea.
> 
> ""This initiative builds on the work we already undertake with tenants to improve skills, provide training and develop employment opportunities.
> 
> ""Our Reward Empowerment and Participation scheme, now in its second year, has proved a success with tenants collecting points for participating in a range of events or meetings for cash reward.
> 
> ""We will be working with our tenants to develop the new scheme further and encourage them to undertake certain repairs within their own homes and communities and to develop skills that may lead to employment.
> 
> ""We believe that this scheme has the potential to benefit tenants, their families and to make a difference to their community.""

Cllr Clyde Loakes Vice Chairman of the Local Government Association's Housing and Environment Board said:

> ""The vast majority of people living in council homes are responsible and sensible tenants, and landlords are glad to let them take proper responsibility for the upkeep of their homes. It is right that the approach should be piloted so risks can be identified and responded to.
> 
> ""Like any other landlord, local authorities need to be able to ensure that maintenance work on their properties continues to be done safely and to a high standard. So landlords need to be able to ensure work affecting gas, electric and fire safety is done properly.
> 
> ""This is vital to making sure this scheme achieves its aim of rewarding tenants and driving down costs without inadvertently exposing councils to a tidal wave of law suits and hefty repair bills for rectifying DIY disasters.""

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7 April 2011
http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/housing/1909121,Andrew Stunell: new online toolkits to tackle scandal of empty homes,"Communities Minister Andrew Stunell today launched two new online toolkits to help local councils and communities better identify the empty homes in their area and bring them back into use.

The launch is part of a week of intensive action by the Minister, to step up work across the country to tackle the 'scandal' of the country's 300,000 empty homes, which if occupied by average sized families would give around 700,000 more people a home of their own.

The Geographical Information System (GIS) Empty Homes Mapping Toolkit, which plots the location of long term empty homes in private ownership across the country, has been developed to allow councils to pinpoint empty homes 'hot spots' in their area, and work with the landlords and local community to bring the derelict properties back into use.

The Empty Homes Knowledge Toolkit will be a new 'one-stop shop', giving local authorities, housing associations, empty property owners, landlords and the wider community access to everything they need to know about bringing properties back into use, including the legislative frameworks, partnership building and investment mechanisms.

Communities Minister, Andrew Stunell said:

> ""Long term empty properties easily fall into disrepair, attracting squatters, vandalism and anti-social behaviour, bringing down the neighbourhood and causing misery for neighbours.
> 
> ""Local communities hold the keys to bringing these empty homes back into use and I hope these new toolkits encourage councils to work with them and the landlords to end the scandal of empty homes.
> 
> ""They will sit alongside the new £100 million fund we have announced for refurbishing properties, and our commitment to match the council tax raised for every empty property brought back into use for six years. Together these are powerful incentives to encourage local areas to bring more properties back into use, and create new homes for thousands of families.""

The mapping toolkit will also include information on the surroundings of empty homes, such as levels of housing needs, numbers of households in temporary accommodation, housing stock by tenure, households on waiting lists, local housing allowance levels, crime, arson, antisocial behaviour data and data on local socio-economic indices - allowing councils to prioritise areas in need of attention.

Both toolkits can be found on the Homes and Communities Agency website: [www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/empty-homes-toolkit?page_id=&page=1](http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/empty-homes-toolkit?page_id=&page=1) (external link).

The knowledge toolkit is available to everyone, and the online mapping toolkit to all local authority and central government partners who are covered by the Public Sector mapping Agreement.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,23 May 2011
http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/housing/1917730,"Government plans release of public land to build 100,000 homes","Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today announced Government plans to release enough public land to build as many as 100,000 new, much-needed homes and support as many as 25,000 jobs by 2015.

The amount of previously-developed land owned by the public sector is more than twice the size of Leicester.

So the Minister today confirmed that by this Autumn, every Government department with significant landbanks will publish plans to release thousands of acres of previously-developed land to housebuilders, so they can get on and build the homes the country needs - supporting thousands of jobs and releasing funds to help in the vital work of bringing down the Budget deficit.

To make this radical ambition a reality by 2015 the Public Expenditure Committee, a Cabinet Committee chaired by Francis Maude, will go through each department's plans with a fine tooth comb, to make sure every possible site is made available for housebuilding.

Alongside this, property specialists from across Government will work with each department and challenge them to release as much land as they can for new homes.

Ministers are also encouraging councils to follow the lead set by central Government and make their unused land available for development.

Later this year, a new map will be launched to show land and buildings owned by public bodies in each area. A new Community Right to Reclaim Land has been introduced enabling residents to apply to organisations including central Government departments and councils to bring their sites back into use - opening up the books so local people can see for themselves the assets held by central and local Government alike.

Grant Shapps also outlined his own department's contribution, as the Homes and Communities Agency publishes its plans to release more land for redevelopment. This includes through a radical Build Now, Pay Later deal, which offers a boost to housebuilders who only pay for the land once work has started on the new homes - providing a lifeline to those struggling with cashflow problems, and enabling them to start building straight away.

Publicly owned sites such as the following have been, and are being, made available for new housing developments across the country:

  * **Fairmile, Oxfordshire** - A 40-hectare former hospital site owned by the Homes and Communities Agency, beside the river Thames in Cholsey, Oxfordshire. Fairmile is being transformed with the creation of 354 new homes including refurbished houses and apartments within the retained Grade II hospital buildings. There will be a mix of commercial, community and leisure facilities as well as landscaped grounds that will be made accessible to the public. The first new homes are due to be completed by developer Linden Homes this month and it is expected that the whole scheme will be complete by 2014. This will also serve as an early pilot for 'Build Now, Pay Later'.
  * **New Covent Garden Market** - a 57 acre site, in Vauxhall, South London, will be redeveloped at no cost to tax payers to provide a new modern market, 2300 apartments, a hotel, shops, a major grocery store and community facilities including a food industry training suite. The market hosts 200 businesses with more than 2500 people employed on the site, the largest single employment site in Wandsworth. New Covent Garden Market is part of the Nine Elms Opportunity area which includes Battersea Power Station and the future home of the American Embassy. To provide additional transport links for the area, which when completed will include 16,000 homes including affordable housing, the developers are funding London Underground's Northern Line Extension. Covent Garden Market's redevelopment project includes the start of the new Green Linear park which will link the Nine Elms Opportunity area and provide additional outdoor and community space for Londoners and visitors; and
  * **Bath** - The rationalisation of office accommodation owned by the Ministry of Defence will free up sites in Bath, which will be brought forward for disposal over the next few years. Subject to planning, the sites have the potential for around 1000 new homes. Bath and North East Somerset's Core Strategy is going to Enquiry in Public in September 2011 and it is anticipated that the Inspector's report is due in spring 2012.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""As one of the country's biggest landlords, the Government has a critical role to play in making sites available for developers so we can get the homes this country needs built.
> 
> ""So today, I can confirm an ambitious challenge across Government to release enough land from Whitehall's grip for 100,000 new homes across the country. Over the coming months, property specialists will work to make sure no stone is left unturned and no site is left unused, and every department's plans will come under the close scrutiny of a Cabinet committee.
> 
> ""The work starts today, with sites already being brought forward by three different departments, including my own, some of which will be available on new terms so developers can start building straight away. So we are already off to a flying start - it is now for developers to come forward, make the most of this unique opportunity, and help contribute to our country-wide efforts to help get the homes this country needs built.""

Chief Secretary to Treasury Danny Alexander said:

> ""This is a double dose of good news, creating and sustaining thousands of jobs by boosting housebuilders while also creating thousands of new homes for people to live in. Getting the economy growing is the Government's top priority and this move, combined with other measures set out in the Plan for Growth to ease planning restrictions, are a key part of helping the private sector led recovery.""

Mark Clare, Chief Executive of Barratt Developments PLC, said:

> ""This is a big step in the right direction. The rapid release of publicly owned land has the potential to be an effective catalyst for increasing the supply of land for new homes in this country during the next few years.""
> 
> ""Barratt has an established track record of working with public sector partners to build out important sites and deliver desperately needed new homes. We are already working on a number of Build Now Pay Later sites with the public sector and, in the wake of today's announcement, will be looking at ways to expand and deepen that partnership.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/housing/1922475,Andrew Stunell: New green revolution needed to cut carbon emissions from existing buildings,"Andrew Stunell has today insisted that carbon reduction measures must be taken to ""green-up"" the country's existing housing stock to reduce its carbon footprint and save households considerable sums of money on their energy bills.

Speaking at the Policy Exchange, the Minister said that around three quarters of the housing stock that will exist in 2050 has already been built, making it vital to tackle emissions from existing buildings, as well as new build properties, to meet the country's tough carbon reduction targets.

Buildings account for over 40 per cent of the UK's CO2 emissions - a figure that needs to fall to almost zero by 2050, which is the equivalent to refurbishing a city the size of Cambridge every month.

Mr. Stunell said that the Government is putting in place a package of measures to enable a step change in domestic retrofit activity that will cut carbon and stimulate jobs and growth, but that Whitehall alone cannot deliver the necessary improvements. He argued that power must be shifted down to local people, businesses and community groups and empower them to shape their environment and promote local economic growth.

The Green Deal which will become available in 2012 will help householders improve the energy efficiency of their homes at no upfront cost. By allowing them to pay for green home improvements over time rather than upfront, through the savings in energy bills, it will remove one of the biggest barriers they currently face to retrofitting - being able to afford the initial investment.

Feed-in Tariffs are available to support homes in generating their own renewable electricity, and support for renewable heat will be available for homes. Looking to the future, the Government's policy on Zero Carbon means that from 2016, new homes will need to be built to a zero carbon standard (and all non-domestic buildings from 2019).

Andrew Stunell said:

> ""Buildings are responsible for over 40 per cent of the carbon emissions we produce each year. If we are serious about a revolution in the energy efficiency of homes, it is vital that we ensure that existing as well as new homes have significantly lower carbon emissions.
> 
> ""A strong programme of retrofitting will green-up our existing homes through the Green Deal, part of our clear strategy for delivering not only more homes, but crucially more sustainable housing.
> 
> ""We need a green revolution in housing that transforms our homes and becomes the central pillar in meeting our commitments to slashing carbon emissions. The Government will put in place measures to help households green their houses - but industry and community need to step up to the plate and deliver them.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/housing/1926278,Shapps asks lenders to back Britain's self-builders,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps will today call on the country's biggest mortgage lenders to back a 'self build revolution' by lending more to those aspiring to build their own home.

In the letter, prepared following discussion with industry and the Building Societies Association and to be sent to key players in the mortgage market, he says that he wants to see building your own house become much more common, to generate much needed supply of affordable and sustainable homes, and calls on them to make more specialist finance products available for self builders.

He says that few people realise that the self-build movement provides more homes than any individual housebuilder, but is still far smaller than in many other countries, and that he believes it could double in size over the next decade.

Lenders often shy away from the self build lending market due to the higher perceived exposure to risk, but with typical interest rates on self build products at around six per cent, Mr.Shapps says that the self builder is an attractive prospective customer and with the self build market relatively undeveloped provided an opportunity for lenders to tap into a new market.

And he says that lenders should not be put off by self build development as that in reality the majority of self build projects are not ""DIY builds"" but involve professional builders, architects and project managers.

He encourages lenders to make more widespread use of indemnity insurance and 'build out' cover to mitigate the risks of self build projects not being finished. He also cited experience from one specialist self build intermediary which indicates that of the 15,000 funded self-build projects started over the past decade, less than 50 have been repossessed.

The UK has one of the smallest proportions of self builders in Europe - today's letter comes as part of the Government's ambitious work programme to encourage growth in the self build sector. He said that whilst Government would play its part, the future growth of the sector depends on lenders themselves backing the country's aspiring builders.

Earlier this year, Mr.Shapps launched a new Industry-Government working group - led by the National Self-Build Association - to generate ideas on how to reduce the barriers faced by prospective builders, including the burden of regulation and the lack of access to land and development finance, which for too long, Mr.Shapps argues, have thwarted the aspirations of people who want to build their own home.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps will say:

> ""Self builders deliver affordable, greener and more innovatively-designed homes; and make a big contribution to the number of new homes built in this country, yet there is scope to significantly increase the number of self built homes in the UK - both for individual households and for community-driven projects.
> 
> ""I want to create a self build revolution where building your own home is not just the preserve of the privileged few and as the mortgage market continues its recovery, lenders have ideal opportunity to diversity lending into areas such as this. With expert knowledge from established intermediaries lenders can make a profit at low risk.
> 
> ""I think there are real business opportunities for lenders here - as the market grows - and I call on them to help make this important housing sector more mainstream.""

As well as proving much needed new housing, there are significant associated benefits to the economy with a stronger self build sector, such as creating local employment opportunities for building professionals, contractors and other property professionals, and helping individuals acquire new skills.

The Government is leading the way by reducing the burden of regulation on the house building industry and putting power in the hands of communities up and down the country, enabling them to give the green light to new developments through the Community Right to Build, and by identifying appropriate opportunities for self-builders when public sector sites are marketed.

### Supportive quotes

Raymond Connor, Chief Executive of BuildStore Financial Services, said:

> ""Compared to the wider housing market, demand for self build finance is continuing to grow, so we would like to see more lenders respond to the self build market, and offer more practical products in order to serve the sector appropriately. The self build market offers high quality lending, and with our development of systems and products which reduce lender's exposure to risk, this presents a great opportunity to provide funding in a growing market, currently worth £2bn annually. As well as enabling more people to build the homes they want and need, funding the self build sector also helps to boost local economies and supports the construction supply chain.""

Martin Bell, Head of customer lending at Norwich and Peterborough Building Society, said:

> ""N&P (Norwich and Peterborough Building Society) is proud to offer self build mortgages and support those who choose to go down the self build route. Building your own home could make perfect financial sense for very many people, and we welcome Grants Shapps' promotion of the self build sector, highlighting the possibilities that are out there. While many may think a self build project is beyond them, it is likely to be much cheaper than buying an existing property and the satisfaction of living in a home that you have seen built from scratch is difficult to match. We are more than happy to talk people through the options available.""

David Lownds, Head of Marketing at the Hanley Economic Building Society, said:

> ""Hanley Economic Building Society has proudly supported Self Build initiatives for the last 3 years. We recognise that there is a need for growth in the self build sector and have demonstrated our commitment to the Self Build proposition through our range of innovative products.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/housing/1933403,Grant Shapps welcomes new group to clear minefield of building standards,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today welcomed the appointment of Sir John Harman to a key group looking at reducing the complexity of home building standards and the impact regulations have on the industry.

Sir John, a former Environment Agency Chairman, will now run a new steering group, established jointly by the Home Builders Federation and the Local Government Group, to:

  * oversee work to simplify, harmonise and declutter the 'minefield' of building standards applied to new housing
  * provide advice to councils and developers on the best way to conduct plan level viability studies, so as to ensure necessary housing development is not blocked by unrealistic expectations or policies.

This work will support the new National Planning Policy Framework, due to be published early in 2012.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Over the past 13 years, housebuilding fell to its lowest levels for any peacetime year since 1924. Working with the industry, councils must do everything they can to ensure that any new developments both meet the needs of the local community, but also remain viable to enable projects to get off the ground.
> 
> ""That's why I'm delighted that the Local Government Association and Home Builders Federation have agreed to appoint Sir John Harman to chair a valuable steering group on this issue and in its examination of how to clear the minefield of housing standards that currently exists. I have no doubt that he will provide the robust independent role to oversee this important work.
> 
> ""I look forward to seeing the recommendations of this new group, and working with them as we continue to make radical reforms to the planning system so communities can have more of a say and see the benefits of growth in their neighbourhoods.""

Stewart Baseley, executive chairman at the Home Builders Federation said:

> ""This is an important first step as we look to reduce the red tape and regulation levied on house building sites. At a time of significant housing shortages it is crucial that the cumulative impact of regulations and standards is scrutinised properly, to help ensure more housing is viable, and unnecessary burdens are avoided. The Steering Group will help Government, Local Authorities and the industry work together to create a realistic understanding that will allow us to build the quality homes the country needs.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/housing/1944644,Government announces new Affordable Homes Programme set to exceed expectations,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today hailed the progress of Government plans to build thousands of new affordable homes over the next four years.

Ministers revealed that their original aspiration to deliver 150,000 new homes by 2015 will not only be met, but exceeded. Appetite for the Affordable Homes Programme has surpassed expectations, with 146 providers sharing almost £1.8 billion to build 80,000 homes under the programme - putting the Government on track to deliver up to 170,000 new homes by 2015, and safeguarding some 80,000 jobs in construction and related trades.

The programme allows social housing providers to charge a rent of up to 80 per cent of the local market level, and use the additional income to support delivery of more affordable homes. Providers may also offer flexible tenancies to new tenants.

Demand from affordable housing providers to be involved in the programme has been huge, and today's announcement confirms every part of England will benefit. The new homes will be delivered in both rural and urban communities, and will include family homes.

Mr Shapps said that funding for the scheme, which is part of a £4.5 billion Government investment in affordable housing, will provide a major boost to people on housing waiting lists, and give a shot in the arm to the construction industry.

Subject to contract, these landlords will now be able to start developing much-needed new affordable homes. This is one of a number of efforts being made to move away from the 'one size fits all' system of social housing to one where a range of options are available to meet local housing needs.

Ministers believe that for years millions of people have been on waiting lists with little hope of ever getting a home. That's why the Government has pledged to do things differently, radically reforming social housing in order to give councils and housing associations more control so they can better meet the needs of the people they serve and build more homes.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""The Affordable Homes Programme has received a ringing endorsement from the sector and confounded the critics, who said the programme would not deliver in the current climate. So I'm pleased to announce that 146 providers are in line to share almost £1.8 billion cash to develop 80,000 new homes, many of which will be larger homes for families.
> 
> ""There were some who predicted doom and said very few would want to be involved in this radical new approach. Others said it would work in the south east but nowhere else. But we now have a wealth of strong proposals, putting us on track to deliver up to 170,000 new affordable homes across the country over the next four years.""

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""To have millions of people stuck on social housing waiting lists is wrong, and denies homes to those who need them. The thousands of new affordable homes that will be delivered under this programme will start to put things right. The new homes will be in towns, cities and rural areas right across the country, and include many homes for families. They'll provide a lifeline to those on waiting lists, and a shot in the arm for the construction industry.""

Pat Ritchie, chief executive of the Homes and Communities Agency, which is delivering the Affordable Homes Programme, added:

> ""The extremely strong response to the new Affordable Homes Programme shows the appetite among the agency's partners to deliver. Through our bidding process our local teams have worked with partners to achieve value for money and the best outcome for communities, the result being that we are now on course to deliver around 80,000 new homes far exceeding expectations.""

The flexible tenancies under the Affordable Homes Programme will be for new tenants only - the lifetime tenancies and succession rights of existing council and housing association tenants will not be affected.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/housing/1954137,Three priorities for delivering community action - Baroness Newlove,"The Government's Champion for Active Safer Communities today set out her top three priorities to help people make a difference to their neighbourhoods. In a new report, Baroness Newlove pinpoints the availability of easy to access online information, a new drive for public sector volunteering and the tackling of binge and underage drinking, as key to achieving her goals.

In March this year, Baroness Newlove published her report _Our vision for safe and active communities_, which called for neighbourhoods to be seen as equal partners in resolving crime, antisocial behaviour and disorder. Today's update highlights where she is focusing her energies and also the Government's progress in meeting the challenges raised by her earlier report.

Working across Government and with community groups and activists, the three areas Baroness Newlove will concentrate on are:

  * Creating an online 'home' for community activism. Building on existing online services, these easy to find and simple to use 'hubs' will provide community activist 'starter kits', together with useful links, contact details, up-to-date funding information and the ability to recruit potential volunteers online.
  * Creating a thriving 'civic service'. Encouraging public servants (like Whitehall civil servants, council staff and the wider public sector), who want to volunteer their skills and time to grass roots activists, providing a range of specialist support from IT, to project management to simply dealing with often complex bureaucracy.
  * Improving the prevention and tackling of underage drinking. Baroness Newlove is positive that more can be done to help communities get on top of problems tied to drugs and alcohol. She is working with the drinks industry and Government to address problem drinking and chairs an Advisory Board leading the roll-out of Community Alcohol Partnerships which bring together local retailers, trading standards and police to eradicate the problem of underage drinking and associated anti-social behaviour.

Baroness Newlove said:

> ""I promised that my report would be a springboard for further action, supporting those inspirational people who, having seen their neighbourhoods deteriorate, have decided to do something themselves rather than sit back and let someone else 'fix it'.
> 
> ""From meeting committed people up and down the country, I know there is more Government can do to unlock the system and bust the barriers that get in the way of successful community activism.
> 
> ""I am delighted that two sources of government funding will support this work and I encourage grassroots activists everywhere to apply. Choices and the Innovation Fund from the Home Office are there to supply £14million of 'fuel' to set this country alight with innovative, inspirational local projects and activities to bring fun and friendship, and in turn safety and security to our neighbourhoods everywhere.
> 
> ""And I am grateful that the private sector is also rallying round. The £800,000 pledged for the extension of Community Alcohol Partnerships will help drive down crime and disorder associated with alcohol abuse and make life safer and more pleasant for everyone.
> 
> ""We need to build on the excellent work already out there and replicate it elsewhere. One of the biggest hurdles to getting things done is the complex public sector language and bureaucracy that locks ordinary people out with jargon and regulations. That's why I am working with government to tip the scales. Government should be there to help communities to help themselves, not complicate things and so frustrate and alienate good citizens.
> 
> ""The new home for community activism will mean no one will be more than two clicks away from simple, easy to use practical help and resources. Our great public servants will be able to get out of Whitehall and the town halls, and use their experience to help in their communities. We're all in this together.""

Writing in the foreword to the report the Prime Minister said:

> ""Helen Newlove is a remarkable person. She brings a special brand of passion, determination and common sense to public life. She has demonstrated true courage in turning a tragic act of violence into a force for good.
> 
> ""Grassroots community activists across the country can take confidence from having such a strong voice in Whitehall and Westminster.
> 
> ""I'm delighted therefore with the progress she continues to make, as set out in this report. Like Helen, I am passionate that we work in partnership with communities across the country to develop strong families and strong neighbourhoods as the foundation of a bigger, stronger society.""

In addition to the three priorities Baroness Newlove has identified, a range of activity is underway across Government to drive up community activism, build safer neighbourhoods and allow communities greater control or influence over the budgets used to tackle crime.

Baroness Newlove intends to publish a review of progress on delivering her priorities and on championing active, safer communities more widely in Spring 2012.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/housing/1959069,Grant Shapps: Swifter justice for victims of 'neighbours from hell',"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today announced plans to speed up the process for evicting persistent 'neighbours from hell' from their homes when all other efforts to curb their anti-social behaviour have failed.

He will propose to introduce a new mandatory power for possession, which will speed up the possession process by allowing previous convictions for serious anti-social behaviour to trigger eviction proceedings and short-cut the often long and expensive process which often requires landlords to prove again the 'yobbish' actions of their nightmare tenants.

Trigger offences are likely to include:

  * a conviction for a serious housing-related offence - including violence against neighbours, drug dealing and criminal damage
  * breach of an injunction for anti-social behaviour - where the social landlord has obtained, or is party to, the injunction; and
  * closure of a premises under a closure order - for example where a property has been used for drug dealing.

The Minister made clear that eviction should only ever be the last resort - but that too often the rights of victims have come second to those of the people making their lives a misery.

It is estimated that the Courts make 3,000 eviction orders for anti-social behaviour against social tenants each year. Most of the others are resolved through other support or enforcement measures such as mediation, acceptable behaviour agreements, Family Intervention Projects or injunctions.

But where landlords reach the last resort of eviction, survey data indicates that it takes on average seven months from applying for a possession order to being granted one. And with some defendants deciding to not turn up or cases being adjourned several times, it can sometimes take much longer.

The costs to landlords, and by extension their tenants, of evicting a 'neighbour from hell' can be well over £20,000 in complex cases.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""All too often, efforts to tackle neighbours from hell take far too long, and it seems the needs and right of the victims play second fiddle to those of the perpetrators.
> 
> ""That's why I'm looking to speed up the process, so where a social housing tenant already has a conviction for anti-social behaviour and the situation has not improved this can be taken into account and landlords can act swiftly to bring an end to the day-to-day misery that is inflicted for too long on those simply seeking to quietly enjoy their homes.
> 
> ""Of course eviction is a drastic step and should be the last resort that landlords take to tackle this menace - but when all other options have failed to stop this yobbish behaviour, victims should not have to wait months or even years to see justice done.""

Baroness Newlove, victims campaigner and the Government's Champion for Active Safer Communities, welcomed this new announcement, which she argued demonstrates clearly that the Government is on the side of victims not offenders.

She said:

> ""My postbag is filled with heartbreaking stories of law-abiding families whose lives are made a living hell by the actions of a few uncaring, selfish individuals whose thoughtlessness or ruthless criminal actions blight and intimidate whole neighbourhoods.
> 
> ""These victims of anti-social behaviour live in abject misery begging in vain for help from one agency or another and sometimes spend years, powerless to do anything about it. If they are owner occupiers they cannot sell their homes and move, such is the trap they are in. This has got to stop.
> 
> ""This action will go a long way to redress the balance in their favour.
> 
> ""We must empower social landlords to back the quiet suffering majority and deal swiftly with the criminal minority. I shall ensure my work gives maximum exposure so any citizen finding themselves in the same situation living next door to the neighbour from hell will have the knowledge and tools to finally see swift redress. Perhaps the very real threat of losing their home may bring to heel those who deny the right of a peaceful life to others.""

Baroness Browning, Minister for Crime Prevention and Antisocial Behaviour Reduction, said:

> ""I welcome these proposals. They build on those outlined in our recent 'More Effective Responses to Anti-social Behaviour' consultation and support the cross-government action on tackling anti-social behaviour, which is a key priority for us.
> 
> ""Our aim is to ensure that, in future, where a community or victim is suffering anti-social behaviour - particularly the sort of targeted, persistent harassment apparent in a number of high-profile recent cases - the police and other local agencies take the problem seriously, deal with it swiftly, and protect vulnerable victims.""

### Notes to editors

1. Today's consultation, _A new mandatory power of possession for anti-social behaviour_, has been published today and can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/antisocialbehaviourconsult](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/antisocialbehaviourconsult). The deadline for responses is 5pm on Thursday 27 October.

2. Examples of recent eviction cases include:

#### Poplar Housing and Regeneration Community Association

Two tenants of Poplar Housing and Regeneration Community Association carried out an extensive campaign of anti-social behaviour targeting their neighbour's family for many years. This included excessive noise, which was witnessed by relevant officers and the police.

As a result of the seriousness of the anti-social behaviour and the impact on the neighbour's young family, a Premises Closure Order was granted on their property in September 2009 - one of the first where drugs were not an issue. The order was later extended but the tenant appealed against the order. The appeal was finally dismissed by the Court of Appeal in October 2010.

In the meantime, the landlord had filed for possession order in the court on 27 October 2009. A directions hearing was held in January 2010 and a trial date was set for 19 November 2010. Pending the determination of the appeal against the closure order and the outcome of the possession case, the landlord took out an injunction excluding the tenants from the property in March 2010.

A possession order was granted on 7 April 2011, 18 months after the process began. Despite the evidence being proven to a criminal standard through to the High Court for the closure order, the landlord had to prove the case all over again for the possession order, putting the witnesses through another trial. Now the tenants have appealed against the possession granted. The total cost of the whole process so far to the landlord has been in excess of £38,000.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/housing/2033453,Grant Shapps: New rules will help end prejudices about social housing,"New flexible tenancies will help end long-held prejudices about social housing and ensure it once again becomes a springboard for success, Housing Minister Grant Shapps said today.

Mr Shapps said the flexible tenancies will end the lazy and patronising perception that social housing is a dead-end option for life.

Instructions published this week by the Minister will ensure that councils and housing associations will, for the first time, have genuine freedom to ensure that more people benefit from social housing.

Starting next year, new tenants will now get the helping hand they need for as long as they need it, rather than a single option of a home for life, ensuring more social homes are available to people who need them. Mr Shapps said for too long social housing has been seen by many as a second-class option, and these changes would restore its original purpose - to provide a flexible alternative to help tenants achieve their aspirations.

Ministers believe the current system has failed, and are introducing the most radical and fundamental reforms to social housing for a generation. The new instructions published this week are a key step in delivering that reform, and will make social housing fairer by striking a sensible balance between the needs of new and existing tenants, whose tenancies will not be affected.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""For too long social housing has been seen by many people as a byword for failure, a home for life in a dead-end street. I want to restore pride to social housing, so a social tenancy is once again seen as a launch pad to fulfil aspirations.
> 
> ""That's why I have published new instructions for councils and housing associations so, for the first time, they have genuine freedom to ensure more people benefit from living in a social home.
>

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,23 November 2011
http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/housing/2033734,New strategy to deliver homes and strengthen the economy,"An ambitious new strategy to tackle the housing shortage, boost the economy, create jobs and give people the opportunity to get on the housing ladder was announced today (21 November 2011) by the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister.

The Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister said the Government has inherited a broken housing market and a devastating collapse in construction from the era of top down targets, but new plans will give the housing market a shot in the arm by boosting supply, easing financial pressures and helping with demand. The action we take will drive up the level of housebuilding, ensure we are helping new home owners and boost consumer confidence.

The Strategy will break the current cycle in which lenders won't lend, builders can't build and buyers can't buy. We'll be making it easier for people to secure mortgages on new homes, help people get on the property ladder, address unfairness in social housing and ensure homes that have been left empty for years are lived in once again.

### Help for home buyers

At the heart of the strategy is a new build indemnity scheme that will give a helping hand for up to 100,000 prospective buyers who are currently frozen out of the housing market because of the need for large deposits.

Under the proposals, homebuyers will be able to secure loans on newly built homes - the bedrock of the first time buyer market - with only a five per cent deposit.

The Government and housebuilders will help provide security for the loan, so if the house is then sold for less than the outstanding mortgage total the lender will be able to recover its loss.

Through the scheme lenders will be encouraged to offer mortgages with smaller deposits, increasing demand for new homes and giving a welcome boost to the housing market.  
   
The Government will also consult shortly on proposals to increase discounts under the Right to Buy, giving social tenants the opportunity to buy the homes they live in. The discount will be improved dramatically and will be up to half the value of the home, making home ownership ever more achievable.

For the first time, the receipts from additional Right to Buy sales will be used to support the funding of new affordable homes for rent on a 'one for one' basis, which is expected to deliver up to 100,000 new homes and support 200,000 jobs.

### Help for housebuilders

Assistance for people buying homes will be matched by support for the people who build them, from the largest housebuilder to people who want to build their own homes.

Affordable housing providers are in line to share almost £1.8bn cash to develop new affordable homes. The first £1bn worth of contracts  under the Affordable Homes Programme  have just been confirmed, putting the Government on track to deliver up to 170,000 new affordable homes across the country over the next four years.

The Government will give more support for local areas that want to deliver new, larger-scale developments that meet the needs of their growing communities. A new prospectus will be published shortly inviting councils and communities to identify opportunities for locally planned large scale development, which will take advantage of streamlined planning processes, giving communities a stronger say and developers greater certainty.

The new plots could vary in size, from a small expansion of a few hundred homes through to a new market town with up to 10,000 homes. Viable schemes that are sustainable and have strong local support will be given financial assistance to get the work going, and will be prioritised for future infrastructure spending.

Where there are existing building sites that have stalled, a £400m Get Britain Building funding pot will enable housebuilders to restart construction, helping to deliver up to 16,000 new homes on sites that already have planning permission, but have been shut down because of economic conditions.

The new support on offer will also benefit self builders, an industry often assumed to be out of reach for some, but one that is increasingly popular and already worth £3.6 billion for the national economy. We are announcing £30 million additional funding to support provision of short term project finance on a repayable basis.

Councils will receive support to work with local people and bring forward plans for larger custom-built housing projects, similar to the successful project in Almere in the Netherlands.

All these measures will be supported through the New Homes Bonus, which will ensure that those areas which are growing have the resources to meet the needs of their new residents and existing communities.

### Improving fairness in social housing

Efforts to boost the supply of new homes and help homebuyers will be matched by improving fairness for those living in social homes.

Measures in the strategy will support the radical programme of reform to the system for social housing that is already underway. The Government will consult on 'Pay to Stay' proposals. This will mean that those social tenants on high salaries, such as household incomes of over £100,000 a year, will pay up to market rents if they want to continue living in taxpayer-subsidised homes.

Councils will be given new powers to reject applications for social housing from people who own a perfectly acceptable home of their own. And there will be stronger measures to help tackle the outrage of 50,000 unlawfully-occupied social homes - with a more detailed consultation to be published later this year.

The overly bureaucratic and complex model of council housing finance will be scrapped too so councils can manage their social housing stock more effectively.

Instead of the revenue generated from social housing being handed over to central Government and redistributed, councils will be able to keep their own receipts, giving them freedom to maintain their housing stock with more efficiency and transparency, in a way that meets local needs.

### Support for the private rented sector

The Strategy will also support greater investment in the private rented sector, a sector which accounts for around 16 per cent of all households.  
Large scale investment will be driven through changes to the tax rules affecting bulk purchases of buy-to-let homes, as well as through measures to encourage the growth of Real Estate Investment Trusts - the globally recognised model for real estate investment that provides low cost access to capital.

An independent review will also consider whether there are barriers to greater large-scale investment in rented housing.

### Action on empty homes

The Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister said that the fact that for years so little has been done to bring the nation's empty homes back into use is a ""national scandal"". Tackling the 700,000 empty homes across the country is a top priority in the strategy, and a key feature in the drive to increase the provision of affordable housing.

Housing Associations and councils will be able to apply for part of £100m of Government funding to bring empty homes that blight neighbourhoods back into use. The money will be used for innovative housing schemes that will ensure empty properties that ruin neighbourhoods are lived in once again, communities are regenerated and at the same time more affordable housing is provided. Government is also announcing £50 million of further funding to tackle some of the worst concentrations of empty homes.

The schemes will be backed by cash rewards through the New Homes Bonus for councils bringing empty homes back into use, and many schemes will also have wider benefits such as providing excellent training opportunities for local people.

The Government is also consulting on plans to allow councils local discretion to introduce a council tax premium on homes in their area that have been empty for more than two years, to provide a stronger incentive for empty homes' owners to bring them back into use.

### Supporting older people to live independently

The Strategy also focuses on the needs of older people and includes a deal to improve the quality and choice of housing available for older people, which aims to help them to stay independent for longer.

Nearly a third of all homes are occupied by the elderly, and nearly two thirds of the projected increase in the number of households over the next twenty years will be headed by someone aged 65 or over.

So a package of measures will help the elderly adapt their homes, or move into alternative housing, to meet their changing needs. As part of this package the Government will work to develop simple and attractive financial products that help older home owners safely release equity that they can then use to maintain or adapt their homes.

Other reforms set out in the strategy include:

  * transferring housing and planning powers from central government to councils and local people, so that they can shape development in their areas
  * replacing top down targets with powerful cash incentives through the New Homes Bonus, so instead of simply feeling the strain that new building projects place on existing services, communities have a reason to support new development
  * supporting private sector growth by reducing regulation and other burdens on house-builders
  * accelerating the release of public sector land with capacity to build up to 100,000 new homes by 2015, and support up to 200,000 construction and related jobs during development.

### Notes to editors

Laying the Foundations: a housing strategy for England can be found at: [http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/housingstrategy2011](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/housingstrategy2011)

Using previously-developed land owned by the public sector to deliver new homes could support as many as 200,000 construction and related jobs, 50,000 in every year of the spending review period.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/housing/2056429,Grant Shapps: First-ever fund will offer £20million support for single homeless people,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today announced a further £20 million to provide single people facing homelessness the help they need to get back on their feet and ensure that they don't have to spend time on the streets.

Mr Shapps said that under homelessness legislation, single people are often not classed as ""priority need"" cases because they have no dependents. Most local authorities do not therefore offer as much support for single homeless people. This means they can often be left with fewer housing options - forced to spend nights 'sofa surfing' at friends' houses, in their car or even on the street.

The minister wants to ensure that nobody is turned away when they are most in need. This extra £20 million will help councils to provide a helping hand to single homeless people in their areas.

Possible uses include:

  * Providing a **dedicated homelessness prevention officer** for lower priority cases to give them the advice and support they need to get their lives in order and find a new home.
  * Funding more provision of **short term emergency accommodation** to prevent them sleeping rough.
  * Improving access to suitable **privately rented accommodation** through rent bond schemes, tenancy support or specialist reconnection services.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""The plight of homeless people should be on our minds all year round - not just at Christmas.
> 
> ""We're fortunate to have some of the toughest laws in the world to prevent people from ending up on our streets, and while homelessness remains lower than in 28 of the last 30 years I'm always anxious to do more.
> 
> ""That's why today I'm announcing £20million of new funding which for the first time will specifically help single homeless people, who all too often slip through the safety net. This money will be used to help prevent homelessness at an earlier stage.""

Mr Shapps is asking councils to work together locally to decide how best to use this cash to meet local needs in the most effective way possible.

A new programme of support will also be introduced to help local authorities improve their homeless prevention process for single people. Local authority homeless practitioners will offer active training on innovative ways to prevent single homelessness as part of existing services. And Homeless Link, working with other voluntary organisations, are developing a best practice letter for local authorities to help provide clear and useful advice and assistance to someone not in priority need.

The £20 million funding is in addition to the existing £400 million Preventing Homelessness Grant over the next four years and will be made available in the New Year. Further details of allocations to each partnership and regional split will be confirmed in due course.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/housing/2057839,Grant Shapps: Funding boost towards national No Second Night Out pledge,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has hailed the first steps toward a national network of homelessness support as £8 million grant funding was allocated to communities across the country to help them adopt London's flagship 'No Second Night Out' initiative.  
  
Mr Shapps recently announced plans to establish a single new national phone line and website so that people across the country will know where to go and who to call to get help for rough sleepers in their area.  
  
London's No Second Night Out pilot, introduced by the Mayor, works with members of the public to quickly identify people sleeping rough in the capital and provides them with the accommodation and support they need to get themselves off the streets.  
  
The Minister said this £8 million allocation will help local communities get the services in place to support a national roll-out of the scheme, helping to ensure that nobody across the country will be forced to sleep on the streets for more than one night.  
  
Welcoming the news, Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""When economic times are tough, protecting the most vulnerable in society becomes even more important.  
  
""That's why we have dedicated £8 million to extend No Second Night Out outside the capital and make sure that anyone who finds themselves on the streets quickly gets the help they need.  
  
""A safe, warm place to stay is something that everyone should be able to rely on, so I'm delighted that 19 more areas will each receive this cash boost to help make sure that no-one will need to spend more than one night sleeping rough.""

Nineteen communities across England are to get up to £250,000 each, delivered through the £20 million Homelessness Transition Fund, which was set up to help support the national rough sleeping strategy, [Vision to end rough sleeping: No Second Night Out nationwide](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/visionendroughsleeping).  
  
Commenting, Sharon Allen, Chair of the Fund's Grants Panel said:

> ""In these difficult times, the funding announced today will help charities provide the vital support that many homeless people need to get back on their feet.  
  
""The quality of applications and demand for help was extremely high. However, I am pleased that these grants will help protect essential services and develop new, more effective ways to stop people living on our streets.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/housing/2064124,Up to two years behind bars proposed for tenancy cheats,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today made proposals to help ensure tenancy cheats who deny social homes to families in need will face justice.

The Minister set out proposals to criminalise the abuse of social homes - such as unlawful subletting and key-selling - with a possible two year jail sentence. He said the plans could free up thousands of homes for housing waiting lists.

Tenancy cheats can earn thousands of pounds a year renting their social homes out to private tenants - but if caught, may currently face no greater penalty than losing their tenancy.

Mr Shapps wants to see much greater legal consequences for these cheats - and so is consulting on proposals that would introduce specific criminal offences for tenancy fraud, such as those which already exist for social security fraud. 

Some estimates suggest that between 50,000 and 160,000 social homes are currently being unlawfully occupied across the country.

The Minister said the plans would also strengthen councils' legal rights as landlords to help them detect and prosecute tenancy fraud more effectively and return lost revenue back to local coffers.

Proposals include:

  * **a new criminal offence** with a maximum sentence of two years' imprisonment and a fine of up to £50,000 if the case goes to the Crown court
  * proceeds of tenancy fraud to be **reimbursed to the social landlord** in whose stock the fraud was committed rather than being confiscated by the State
  * more **powers for local authorities to investigate** social tenancy fraud through better access to data from banks and utility companies. While councils can currently request data, organisations can refuse to provide it. The proposed changes would oblige them to comply.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Tenancy cheats are taking advantage of a vital support system for some of the most vulnerable people in our society and getting away with a slap on the wrist while our waiting lists continue to grow. It's time for these swindlers to pay the price. 
> 
> ""It would cost us billions of pounds to replace the huge number of unlawfully occupied social homes across the country. Meanwhile tenancy cheats can earn thousands of pounds letting out their property, which was given to them in good faith and which could instead be offering a stable home to a family in need.
> 
> ""The proposals I've announced today would not only deliver justice to these fraudsters, but will also act as a deterrent to those who think they can earn a fast buck from this precious resource. I want everyone to know that our country's social homes are going to those in genuine need, not providing a 'nice little earner' to someone who could afford to live elsewhere.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/housing/2084753,Housing and construction champions announced,"After launching the Department's Red Tape Challenge 'Housing and Construction' theme last month, the Secretary of State is pleased to announce the appointment of Simon Randall CBE and Councillor Stephen Greenhalgh as Sector Champions.

The review of regulations will reflect the approach taken in the Housing Strategy published in November last year. The Strategy outlines how the Government is committed to better environmental standards, more affordable housing, security of tenure, legal protection for tenants and leaseholders, and support for the elderly, vulnerable households and those on low incomes.

The Government has already taken a series of steps to cut unnecessary red tape, including abolishing Home Information Packs, reducing burdens on short-term holiday lets, removing blanket regulation on Houses of Multiple Occupation that would have reduced choice for tenants, and introduced new freedoms and flexibilities for social landlords via the Localism Act. This review will help inform the scope for further reductions of unnecessary and disproportionate red tape.

The Sector Champions will be supporting the review by using their experience and industry contacts to help shine the spotlight on our Red Tape Challenge theme.

Simon Randall CBE is a solicitor specialising in housing and also has a strong background in local government having served as a Councillor and through his work with Housing Associations such as chairing Broomleigh Housing Association. In his spare time, he is also actively involved in supporting mutuals and co-operatives.

Stephen Greenhalgh is Councillor for Town Ward in Fulham and Leader of Hammersmith and Fulham Council. He has extensive experience of the local government and housing sector. He is a successful entrepreneur and, as a landlord himself also understands the business perspective.

Both champions are keen to be involved in the Red Tape Challenge and to support the Department.

Simon Randall said:

> ""The housing and construction sectors are arguably the most highly regulated in the UK. There is enormous scope for reducing red tape which could both increase and speed up the supply of private rented and social housing without in any way compromising on quality, security or sustainability. This will be the overall challenge for the sectors and I look forward to their suggestions for abolition or simplification of existing regulations.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/housing/2095538,Andrew Stunell offers £100m boost to breathe life back into empty homes,"Neighbourhoods suffering the blight of empty homes could benefit from a £100 million boost to bring these properties back into use and provide stable homes for families in need, Communities Andrew Stunell announced today.

Seeking expressions of interest for the scheme, the Minister stressed that the funding was to breathe new life into the country's abandoned streets by bringing back into use clusters of empty homes that can often attract anti-social behaviour, vandalism and fly-tipping to neighbourhoods.

There are more than 700,000 empty homes across the country - with around 280,000 unused and under-maintained for six months or more.

Since the introduction of the New Homes Bonus the number of long term empty homes has been reduced by nearly 38,000 since October 2009, with rewards to local authorities of £64 million as a result.

Today Mr Stunell offered £50 million Government funding to areas with clusters of empty homes which have good market prospects, such as access to transport links, but require intensive refurbishment to return them to a liveable standard.

Councils who wish to apply will match the funding they receive - bringing the total investment to £100 million. Every successful bid must have strong local support and aim to bring at least 100 homes back into use.

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""It's shocking that hundreds of thousands of houses sit unoccupied while people across the country are in need of a home of their own. Thousands of homes have already been brought back into use in the last year - but there are still many areas where there are whole streets of abandoned homes.
> 
> ""That's why today I'm offering Government cash, backed up by the investment of communities themselves, for a £100 million boost to breathe new life into these areas and providing homes to those in need.
> 
> ""I want my ambition to be matched by the communities that apply for this cash injection, with local people backing locally-led efforts to bring at least 100 empty homes in their area back into use. And in addition, these areas will receive further financial recognition for their efforts through the New Homes Bonus.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/housing/2107157,Grant Shapps: Helping tenants take control,"Plans to make it easier for council tenants to take control of their local neighbourhood and services were announced today by Housing Minister Grant Shapps.

Mr Shapps challenged tenants who feel their landlords have neglected their neighbourhood to exercise their rights and take matters into their own hands in the spirit of last year's riot clean-up crews.

The Minister today published plans to strengthen and streamline two key rights that can help tenants achieve this.

The Right to Manage gives tenants the chance to take over the day-to-day management of housing services such as cleaning, repairs, refurbishment and security to deliver a more responsive, better quality and value for money service for their community.

New proposals will streamline the piles of paperwork involved in transferring management responsibilities to a tenant organisation, speeding up the handover process.

The Right to Transfer allows tenants to request the ownership of council homes in their neighbourhood to be transferred from the council to a local housing association. This could be because tenants believe this new landlord could provide better services like cleaning and security or bring more investment into their area such as improvement to peoples homes and the environment.

At the moment tenants can put forward a case for transfer, but councils have no obligation to consider their proposals. The changes proposed today will strengthen these rights, requiring councils to work with tenants to explore transfer requests.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Last year's 'broom army' action in the aftermath of the riots demonstrated the real difference a community can make when they come together for the good of their area. The rights I'm strengthening today can put decision making power into the hands of the tenants who know their neighbourhoods best.
> 
> ""I want to make it easier than ever for council tenants to take charge of local services, from minor repairs to major regeneration. And it will no longer be acceptable for councils to dismiss tenants' proposals for improvement out of hand.
> 
> ""Nobody knows the needs of a neighbourhood better than the local community. Now I want to see tenants use these powers to prove us right.""

Communities across the country are already taking advantage of their Right to Manage their area:

  * The 1960s Bloomsbury Estate in Birmingham has been transformed by the tenants themselves, through using their Right to Manage. The tenant-led management board set a local 'Bloomsbury Standard' for improvement to homes that exceeds the Decent Homes Standard. They have also rebuilt a number of homes and a new Lottery-funded leisure complex. Since taking responsibility for the estate, the Board has boosted rent arrears recovery and saved £750,000 over five years through better productivity.

  * Tenants took up management of Childwall Valley Estate, South Liverpool, in 2000 in response to the council's 'emergency repairs only' policy. They are working to reduce anti-social behaviour with the police and Citizens Advice Bureau, and community wardens now work with work with local young people. They have also demolished the unpopular high rise blocks in the area to make way for new homes, and demand for properties on the estate now far exceeds supply.

  * In New Barracks, Salford the Tenant Management Cooperative have introduced community activities including street parties and children's playschemes, raised funds for installing play equipment, maintained the local park area, and contributed half the cost to installing CCTV on the estate.

  * And since the Pembrooke Estate Plymouth was taken over by tenants in 1994, crime rates have fallen, a Youth Service has been set up to train excluded school pupils and other vulnerable youngsters, and residents consider the estate to be well managed, clean and safe. They are now in charge of a £5 million refurbishment programme.

### Notes to editors

1. The consultation runs until 23 May 2012, and comments are being invited from a wide range of consultees from across the local authority, housing and tenant sectors.

2. Today's consultation, _Giving Tenants Control: Right to Transfer and Right to Manage Regulations_, introduces new regulations on Right to Transfer and proposes streamlining the existing Right to Manage regulations. Details can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/transfermanageconsult](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/transfermanageconsult).

3. Right to Transfer Regulations would put a duty on local authorities to co-operate with tenant groups in following a process for exploring transfer options, and if, after this exploration there is evidence of support for a transfer, to consult all the affected tenants.

4. By following the procedures set out in Right to Manage Regulations, a tenant management organisation can enter into an agreement with their local housing authority to take over responsibility for managing local services.

5. _Giving Tenants Control: Right to Transfer and Right to Manage Regulations - Consultation_ proposes streamlining these regulations so that it is easier for tenant management organisations to take over responsibility for delivering local services from their local authority landlord.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/housing/2110099,Grant Shapps: 'Invest to save' and offer support to vulnerable people,"Councils must 'invest to save' and protect their most disadvantaged residents, Housing Minister Grant Shapps said today.

The Minister urged town halls to follow Whitehall's example and protect Supporting People funding to help the most vulnerable in their communities.

In a letter to council leaders, he reminded councils as they set their budgets they should consider evidence showing that every pound spent through this housing support services saves £3 - in reduced costs in homelessness, tenancy failure, crime, health and residential care packages.

So the £1.6 billion invested annually in Supporting People can save as much as £3.41 billion in the costs of alternative help for vulnerable people in our communities.

#### Funding protected

The Government protected £6.5 billion funding for Supporting People over the course of the Spending Review - representing a less than one per cent cash reduction in funding each year.

The funding helps people across the country to live independently in their own homes.

These can include:

  * older and disabled people
  * single homeless people
  * people with mental health problems; and
  * women at risk of domestic violence.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""Local taxpayers will rightly expect their councils to do their utmost to protect the services that help the most vulnerable residents in their communities - and so do I.
> 
> ""That's why, despite the need to cut the record deficit we inherited, we've protected the £6.5 billion Supporting People funding which each year helps approximately a million people to live independent lives.
> 
> ""As councils look to set their budgets, I would urge them to consider the evidence that with each pound spent through Supporting People saving £3 by avoiding more costly alternatives, and invest to save to ensure help continues for those most in need.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/housing/2137639,Grant Shapps: Surge of interest in national home swap scheme,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today hailed the national home swap scheme, _HomeSwap Direct_, as inquiries via the new scheme passed the million mark.

Since its launch in October 2011, over a million searches for properties have been made through _HomeSwap Direct_. The new scheme allows social housing tenants wanting to swap their home to see, for the first time, every available property in the country.

Mr Shapps said the surge of interest from tenants testified to a dramatic improvement since the failure of the centrally-prescribed MoveUK service. Started in 2004, within two years the number of moves had collapsed by half, and there was no clear strategy to improve the situation.

Now with over 5,500 searches a day, it is clear the greater choice offered through _HomeSwap Direct_ is proving popular with tenants who want to move house, whether to be closer to a new job or their family, or to find a property that better suits their needs.

Until now tenants have been restricted to swapping properties with other tenants in a scheme chosen by their landlord - effectively meaning only a partial swap scheme existed, and often an uphill battle for tenants if they wanted to move anywhere other than the neighbourhood where they already lived. _HomeSwap Direct_ is now giving tenants access to a much wider selection of properties than ever before and boosting their prospects of moving.

The scheme is online, so advertised swaps are much more accessible for tenants and the possibility of moving house is 'just a click away'.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""It's plain wrong that social tenants are barred from the same life opportunities as everyone else. Social housing is supposed to be a springboard to success - but under the old system tenants who wanted to make a longer-distance move had no realistic opportunity of ever swapping their home.
> 
> ""It's just one example of the lazy consensus that condemned social tenants to be trapped in homes that didn't meet their needs, and blocked their path to aspiration.
> 
> ""So I'm delighted that _HomeSwap Direct_ is at last giving tenants the opportunities they deserve. Instead of being pushed to the back of the queue, tenants now have more power to arrange their own home swaps and the chance to move anywhere in the country, whether to be closer to a new job or their family, or to find a property that better suits their needs.
> 
> ""There are some who have criticised the scheme, who'd rather see tenants stay put and make do. But the surge of interest by social tenants has confounded the critics, and proved they are no longer prepared to accept the old way of doing things.""

### Notes to editors

_HomeSwap Direct_ brings together four internet-based providers of mutual exchange services (HomeSwapper, House Exchange, Abritas and LHS (Locata)) to offer tenants more choice over where they live.

A membership agreement which has been developed by Government and joined by these providers is available on the Department for Communities and Local Government website. This sets out the framework under which information will be shared by providers, the technical requirements of the scheme and the processes by which new members can apply to join. A copy can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/documents/corporate/pdf/2016632.pdf](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/corporate/pdf/2016632.pdf).

A new Tenancy Standard came into force on 1 April 2012 and places a requirement on social landlords in England to subscribe to an internet-based mutual exchange service. The provider of the service must be a signatory to an agreement such as _HomeSwap Direct_ under which tenants can access matches across all (or the greatest practicable number of) internet based mutual exchange services.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/housing/2145333,Grant Shapps: Revamped Right to Buy to deliver thousands of new homes,"Details of how thousands of new affordable homes will be built using the cash proceeds from the Government's reinvigorated Right to Buy scheme were today unveiled by Housing Minister Grant Shapps.

The Minister said he was responding to appeals by local authorities for more time to take advantage of the new scheme by allowing them three years to reinvest the funds they gain from additional sales into hew housing. He said councils now have a ""prime opportunity"" to refresh their housing stock and help meet the housing needs of hard-working families currently languishing on the waiting list.

The revamped Right to Buy, which will give 2.5 million social tenants the opportunity to buy their home with discounts of up to £75,000 was launched last month.

Mr Shapps has said his ambition is that, for the first time, every extra Right to Buy home sold will be replaced by a new affordable home to rent nationally. He said he had listened to views raised by councils on how they would deliver this ambition, and has agreed to extend their timeframe for spending the receipts from two years to three.

Under the new, light touch agreement between Whitehall and Town Halls published today, councils will have the opportunity to keep receipts from additional Right to Buy sales and the freedom to spend the cash as they see fit to meet local housing demand.

Councils will have the freedom to:

  * decide on the type, size and location of the new homes they build according to local needs
  * work with other organisations such as housing associations to finance and deliver affordable homes for their area; or
  * pass the cash to Whitehall to help deliver one-for-one replacement at a national level.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""By upping the Right to Buy discount to a maximum of £75,000 we've given hope back to thousands of council tenants who want to own their home, and for the first time in years, social housing is on the move.
> 
> ""For every extra property sold under Right to Buy we're giving councils the flexibility to build the homes they need, where they need them - or to work with us to ensure every penny raised through the scheme goes towards housebuilding. I've listened to their views, and they now have three years to make the most of the extra funds the scheme will bring.
> 
> ""This is a prime opportunity for councils across the country to refresh their housing stock, handing the keys to thousands of tenants who want to cross the threshold to home ownership and building new affordable properties to rent for local families who for too long have been left languishing on the waiting lists.""

To ensure best value for taxpayers' money, Mr Shapps said Right to Buy funds should account for no more than 30 per cent of total investment in new homes - in place of Government funding. This is in line with the highly successful Affordable Homes Programme, which has exceeded expectations and is expected to deliver up to 170,000 new affordable homes by 2015.

However, the Minister was clear that the new homes must be delivered as quickly as possible, which is why councils must spend the cash on new affordable homes for rent within three years of first receiving it. This has been extended from the original proposal of two years in response to feedback from councils.

And if additional Right to Buy receipts remain unspent after three years they will be returned to Whitehall to be reinvested in housebuilding nationally.

### Notes to editors

1. Additional Right to Buy receipts for councils that have not signed the Right to Buy agreement will immediately be passed on to the Homes and Communities Agency or the Greater London Authority for investment. Councils will then be able to bid for funding for investment in affordable housing from this pot.

2. Councils that wish to retain additional Right to Buy receipts for the first quarter of 2012/13, must sign up to the Right to Buy agreement by Wednesday 27 June 2012. Agreements can be signed after this date but will not cover receipts for Q1.

3. The agreement being issued today follows a short technical consultation in April 2012.

4. If Right to Buy receipts remain unspent at the end of three years they must be returned to central Government for investment by the Homes and Communities Agency or Greater London Authority. Similarly, if receipts constitute more than 30 per cent of total investment, then a sum equivalent to the overspend should be returned to central Government.

5. The remaining 70 per cent invested in new affordable homes must come from authorities' or housing associations' own resources, which could include borrowing supported by the additional rental income. (For local authorities this will be possible only if they have sufficient headroom to borrow under the recent Self-Financing settlement.)

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/localgovernment/1600805,"Pickles stops unitary councils in Exeter, Norwich and Suffolk","Wasteful and unnecessary restructuring plans for Exeter, Norwich and Suffolk Councils are to be stopped immediately the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Eric Pickles announced today.

Stopping these changes will save the taxpayer £40m in restructuring costs, remove the risk of further pressure on local council tax bills, and avoid a costly distraction from the priority of delivering local services and genuine efficiency gains.

An urgent Bill is being introduced in Parliament today by the coalition Government to revoke the orders that create the new unitary councils. Subject to Parliament the aim is to enact the Bill by the summer to give certainty and stability for councils' budgets.

The independent Boundary Committee recommended last December that the unitary plans for Exeter and Norwich should not be implemented. There were concerns about affordability, the risk of fragmenting local services, and the lack of widespread local support.

Mr Pickles said:

> ""When the priority must be to tackle the immense public deficit we have inherited, it is ludicrous that taxpayers' money is being wasted imposing a council reorganisation in Exeter and Norwich.
> 
> This Government made it clear in its Coalition Agreement that reducing unnecessary spending would be part of how we cut the deficit. Today I am pulling the plug on this expensive distraction and saving the taxpayer £40m of restructuring costs.
> 
> Councils in Devon, Norfolk and Suffolk will now be able to concentrate on delivering services to their communities and achieving genuine savings for the local people who elected them.""

The Secretary of State also called a halt to the consultation on proposed changes to Suffolk. Councils in Suffolk had been asked to establish a county constitutional convention to reach a consensus on a unitary structure for Suffolk. This will now be cancelled and all restructuring plans for Suffolk will be stopped.

### Notes to Editors

1. The October 2006 Local Government White Paper invited councils to submit proposals for unitary restructuring. In January 2007, Exeter and Norwich City Councils and Ipswich Borough Council submitted proposals. In December 2007, the then ministers judged that these did not meet the full criteria, and asked the Boundary Committee to look at alternative proposals for the whole or part of Devon, Norfolk and Suffolk.

2. The Committee provided their advice in December last year recommending a single unitary council for Devon, a single unitary council for Norfolk, and made two proposals in Suffolk - a single unitary council for Suffolk (the Committee's preferred option) or a two-unitary pattern comprising an Ipswich and Felixstowe authority and a Rural Suffolk authority. This was followed by a six week period of representations about the advice and the original proposals from the city and borough councils.

3. The then ministers received over 2,700 representations and had meetings with many of the councils concerned and MPs for the areas. They concluded that the Boundary Committee's recommendations for Norfolk and Devon did not have the support of any of the areas' principal councils and they decided to take no action on the Committee's proposals for those councils. Whilst acknowledging that the original proposals for Exeter and Norwich did not meet all the criteria, the then ministers decided nevertheless to go ahead with them and create unitary councils for those cities from 1 April 2011.

4. Implementing these unitary proposals was estimated to involve £40m restructuring costs to be incurred up to 2014-15. In that period, it was forecast that savings of £39.4m could also be achieved. From 2015-16 annual savings of £6.5m were forecast. Councils should be able to make savings of this scale and more including through sensible co-operation between each other and with partners, without the need for any reorganisation.

5. This decision was challenged in Judicial Review proceedings by Devon and Norfolk county councils. There was a hearing on 28th and 29th April 2010 and a judgment is awaited. The proposed legislation will bring certainty whatever the outcome of Court proceedings.

6. In Suffolk, the then ministers concluded that none of the proposals commanded support from all the Councils, and the Government proposed a County Constitutional Convention comprising the principal local authorities in Suffolk and their MPs to reach a consensus on a possible unitary solution.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/localgovernment/1608032,How 'Fabio' is your footie food?,"Do you know the score when you order takeaway?

With England's World Cup campaign due to kick off this Saturday millions of England fans are expected to settle down in front of a big screen TV with their takeaway or pub grub without knowing how clean the kitchen that made it is.

Ministers are urging councils to expose the official food hygiene ratings for every fast-food outlet, pub or restaurant in Britain. Every year councils inspect thousands of food outlets but the information is not always made easily available.

As part of the new Coalition Government's pledge to open up officially held information, ministers want people to be able to see at the touch of a button whether their favourite takeaway is up to the mark or falling short.

Under The Food Safety Act 1990 any establishment making food is routinely inspected every six months to three years, but so far just ninety four councils routinely release that data through the [www.scoresonthedoors.org.uk](http://www.scoresonthedoors.org.uk/) (external link) website but the data isn't necessarily openly available for use even then. Now ministers are encouraging every council to share what they know about food outlets in an open-data format that could be used by third-party websites or to create an iPhone app to help fans decide where find 'top-notch footie-food'.

Local Government Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""With England's World Cup kicking off on Saturday, takeaway orders will go through the roof. In future it should be possible to quickly and easily check the food hygiene record of your favourite 'chippy' or pizza delivery service from your mobile phone without even leaving the sofa. This is data which is already collected, but by making it freely available the so called 'wisdom of crowds' could drive hygiene standards much higher.
> 
> ""Nowadays people who book a family holiday are used to checking on sites like Trip Advisor to find out what others thought of their hotel. If councils now release their food hygiene information in an open-data format then restaurant reviews could routinely reference it. Nothing would do more to drive up hygiene standards than shining a bright light on this information which is already gathered.""

Ninety four councils have already worked with the Food Standards Agency _Scores on the Doors_ scheme to get reports online. Ministers are urging all councils to do the same and for that data to be more open to other services like popular phone based applications including Google Maps which already provides user restaurant reviews, but could in the future easily include hygiene rating information too.

Councils are being encouraged to go further by throwing open all their files. The idea is that if information is subject to Freedom of Information it is information that should be provided for free.

Mr Shapps is calling for councils to think right across the piece. Not presuming to know what people need to see but letting local people decide for themselves.

### Notes to Editors

1. _Scores on the Doors_ already lists over 100,000 premises and gets around 50,000 requests a month via text or internet for council hygiene star ratings. Ministers are urging that the data be opened up so that third-parties can include the information alongside restaurant reviews online and on iPhone style apps.

2. The move comes as part of Communities Secretary Eric Pickles' new drive for greater transparency in town hall openness accountability, where councils are being encouraged to publish details of all spending over £500 in full and online.

3. Councils are being encouraged to throw open their files and alongside spending info, publish a wide range of data online including:

  * information on senior salaries, names and job descriptions;
  * councillor allowances and expenses;
  * minutes and papers of council meetings;
  * job vacancies that will enable people to see why council wage bills are so high and how many of the positions are for key local services;
  * frontline service data - including rubbish and recycling rates, council tax collection rates and detail of major planned projects;
  * data such as food hygiene reports for food outlets - information which is routinely collected and of interest to residents, but not currently shared in an easily accessible format.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/localgovernment/1616240,Eric Pickles - councils must become savvy shoppers,"Too often councils are getting ripped off when procuring goods or services even though the nation's deficit is running at £156bn.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles is calling on councils to buy smarter and make every pound go further. Local Government spends £42bn a year on outside contracts including everything from construction and IT to telecoms and catering. That is more than the national GDP of ninety countries including Luxembourg, Jordan and Albania.

There are massive (in some cases up to 745 per cent) differences between what parts of the public sector, including councils, are paying.

Ministers believe that a fortune could be saved if more councils use their collective buying power and innovative technology like e-auctions to bring the full weight of the public pound to bear on driving down costs and getting better value for taxpayers money.

If councils work together to jointly buy goods and services they can achieve major economies of scale through better deals from suppliers.

The Office of Government Commerce (OGC) found that only 12 per cent of local government used approved collaborative deals, way below the recommended level of fifty per cent.

Next week the Local Government Association will host an 'enhancing productivity' meeting chaired by Eric Pickles and Baroness Eaton to help councils improve value for money, procurement practices and collaboration in an effort to protect services.

Councils own and maintain a lot of assets. For example 470,000 civic buildings; over 50,000 vehicles including more than 6,000 bin lorries; over 1 million (1.27m) computers. The National Audit Office found that what the public sector was paying varied dramatically:

  * The cost of toner varied widely by 745 per cent between the lowest and highest prices (£0.0022 to £0.0186 per sheet) paid for the same broad specification of laser printer black toner.
  * The cost of envelopes varied by 348 per cent between the lowest and highest prices (£2.04 to £9.13) paid for the same broad specification of manila envelopes.
  * The cost of paper varied by 116 per cent between the lowest and highest prices (£6.84 to £14.79) paid for the same broad specification of paper.

Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Eric Pickles said:

> ""Some councils have a supermarket sized budget but a cornershop mentality. This has got to change. Local authorities need to look at where every penny is going and what that money is delivering.
> 
> ""Shining a light on spending will help to put savings before cuts. Whilst councils have already delivered significant efficiencies there is still more excess waste to cut back.
> 
> ""A renewed and concerted focus on better procurement, greater transparency and shared services that puts the emphasis on productivity above processes will end duplication, wasteful spending and wasteful working.""

The Secretary of State has written to councils to tell them that transparency and openness must be the default setting for the way they do their business and called on local government to move at speed to adopt plans to publish details of all spending over £500 in full and online.

Greater transparency will root out wild overspending, expensive mistakes and waste and could be the key to saving the public purse millions of pounds.

For example, the Audit Commission has abandoned plans to appoint a new Chief Executive after Eric Pickles, the Communities Secretary, said the proposed remuneration deal on offer was against the spirit of public sector austerity and that it would send a signal to councils across the country that they too can stop paying ridiculous sums to chief executives.

The expectation is that councils will see the benefits for residents and grasp this agenda. Increased scrutiny is not just about savings. It is about new approaches to the way services are delivered. Efforts to deal with some of the most complex problems in communities are too often approached in a separate rather than joined up way.

Police, social services and health work are too often approaching the same problem from a different perspective rather than working together to achieve a shared result. This duplication of spending, targets, reports and paperwork are costly, time intensive and do not provide the solutions that are needed.

There is real scope for joint working between agencies and between authorities that could transform the way that services are delivered and make the challenge of doing more for less a reality.

### Notes to editors

The LGA's Improvement and Development Agency suggest in total councils spend:

  * Over £2bn each year on waste management procurement
  * £1.4bn each year on electricity and gas
  * £2.2bn per annum on the procurement of temporary agency staff and £1.8bn on external consultants
  * Over £4bn each year on ICT equipment and related services - they own over 1 million (1.27m) computers
  * £16.2bn each year on construction
  * About £18bn each year on adult social care including £11.6bn on external providers.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/localgovernment/1633608,Eric Pickles unveils radical plan for town halls to help cut red tape,"A radical plan to banish nonsense red tape and repeal unnecessary laws was unveiled by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles today.

In a speech to a local government audience Mr Pickles invited council workers and sector experts to suggest CLG sponsored statutory guidance, secondary legislation or regulations they think should be removed so councils can get on with their job.

Piles of regulatory red tape are a traditional part of law making. But the Government has made it clear that it would shun the bureaucratic levers of the past imposed on councils and help encourage, local people to take control themselves. All 'Cut Red Tape' ideas that are put forward will be considered.

Ministers are already earmarking pages of unnecessary regulations, ridiculous micromanagement or outdated laws that need to be re-examined. For example the 1919 law that required the Secretary of State's consent if councils wanted to buy new land for allotments; three different sets of regulation governing tree protection; and guidance on the duty to carry out an economic assessment.

The coalition programme for government committed to giving the public the opportunity to challenge the worst regulations and to introducing a 'one-in, one-out' rule whereby no new regulation is brought in without other regulation being cut by a greater amount. And 'sunset clauses' will ensure regulation is regularly reviewed.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""Too much power has been sucked out of communities into Westminster eroding trust in politics, and sapping responsibility and initiative with stifling bureaucracy.
> 
> ""More often than not over legislating simply lead to bureaucrats ticking extra sets of boxes on forms but none of the real changes that are needed. We need a sensible new approach that makes clear laws are intended to protect people, not overwhelm them with red tape.
> 
> ""Today I am asking councils to put localism into action and help us cut back red tape, wrest control away from the bureaucrats, reverse the years of creeping state control and return power to people, communities and councils.
> 
> ""Up and down the country there are thousands of town hall workers and sector experts who want to make a real difference in their communities. But for far too long they have been tied up in needless bureaucracy that has been a burden on the important work they want to do.""

The Deputy Prime Minister is spearheading the coalition's push to restore power to individuals creating a more open politics where the public are more engaged in Government where as many people as possible submit ideas for change.  The Government launched the 'Your Freedom' public debate and website last Thursday.

Councils are already welcoming the chance to reduce burdens with over 240 having coming forward already. All ideas should be sent to: [cutredtape@communities.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:%20cutredtape@communities.gsi.gov.uk).

1. List of CLG secondary legislation being considered for revocation can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/localgovernment/about/helpcutredtape](http://www.communities.gov.uk/localgovernment/about/helpcutredtape/).

The coalition has already begun to roll back on swathes of unnecessary red tape:

  * called time on the Regional Spatial Strategy putting power back in the hands of local people and scrapped housing targets. Soon I will be announcing the full list of incentives to local authorities that will encourage development

  * made HIPS history and already the number of homes being put up for sale has gone up by 35 per cent

  * put an end to unwanted 'garden grabbing' putting the decision back in the hands of local people

  * cut the ring fencing and red tape which comes attached to hundreds of millions pounds worth of central government grants

  * abolished Comprehensive Area Assessments where town halls report back to Whitehall

  * handed over more power to councils so they can manage high concentrations of shared housing in their area, without putting off landlords from renting the homes people need

  * Vince Cable has announced an immediate review of all regulation in the pipeline for implementation which has been inherited from the last Government

  * Lord Young of Graffham has been appointed as advisor to the prime minister on health and safety law and practice to reduce the compensation culture.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/localgovernment/1634337,Don't waste money on excessive consultation says Shapps,"The new Government has today stripped away another layer of costly red tape by freeing councils to improve how they are run without holding expensive local talking shops.

Laws passed in 2007 mean that all councils have to choose whether to have a locally elected mayor or a council leader, but are required to consult their residents before any changes can be made. District councils are the only ones yet to make this decision.

The Government has pledged to scrap the need for councils to change how they are run so they will no longer have to go through this costly and time-consuming process.

But before that can happen, Local Government Minister Grant Shapps has today [written](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/letterconsultationrequirements) to all these councils, highlighting their freedom to take a light touch approach to the consultations, at minimal cost to council taxpayers.

Councils could choose to hold expensive talking shops - or they could use a newspaper article, press release, or their website, to get local views.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""The path to change is too often littered with hoops and hurdles, form filling and cost. I want us to cut out the paperwork and get on with making a difference.
> 
> ""Of course it is important that local people have a say over how their council is run. But as council taxpayers they will not expect their councils to spend a fortune trying to ask for their opinions.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/localgovernment/1682973,Grant Shapps calls time on the Town Hall pollsters,"Local Government Minister Grant Shapps has today scrapped the Place Survey, one of the largest surveys in Europe that was due to be conducted by local authorities this autumn.

Today's move to scrap the survey is part of concerted efforts by the new Government to release councils from Whitehall control - leaving them free to respond flexibly and effectively to the needs of their residents.

It follows the scrapping of Comprehensive Area Assessments by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles in June, instead making councils more accountable to residents rather than ministers in Whitehall.

The announcement also follows on from the new Government's plans to require councils to publish online their spending over £500; to stop Town Hall publications which compete with local newspapers; and to block the practice of councils and quangos hiring agencies to lobby Government.

The Place Survey is a postal survey conducted by every council in England. Introduced in 2008, it involves over half a million residents and is estimated to cost more than £5 million to run.

Results have been fed back to central Government and used to measure councils' performance on a range of centrally-imposed targets.

Fieldwork for this year's survey was due to take place by all councils between September and December this year - but the Minister has today scrapped this to prevent the cash being diverted from vital public services.

Mr Shapps believes that the Place Survey was an example of wasteful municipal spending - which required council officials to ask residents a range of intrusive personal questions.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""These surveys are a cosmetic exercise which never change anything. Let's give real power back to the people - such as letting taxpayers veto high council tax rises.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/localgovernment/1695250,Minister praises Dartford for binning fortnightly collections,"Local Government Minister Bob Neill praised Dartford Council for listening to the public on keeping weekly bin collections alive on a visit to the area today.

Mr Neill applauded the innovative public poll that showed 94.5 per cent of residents who took part wanted to keep weekly collections, and urged other councils to follow suit. Councils across the country have been moving to fortnightly collections over the past few years despite public support for weekly rounds.

Mr Neill today pledged that the Government will be legislating in November's Localism Bill to allow local residents to initiate local referendums.

The Government is currently carrying out a comprehensive review of all waste policy from product package to waste collection. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has already withdrawn Audit Commission guidance encouraging councils to switch to fortnightly collections and laid out plans to remove the bin tax laws from the statute books.

Mr Neill met refuse collectors on their collection round in Joydens Wood today and spoke to some of the residents who voted to keep weekly collections in the 'Big Bin Vote'.

Mr Neill said:

> ""The binman has never been so welcome as now with so many councils cutting weekly collections. Fortnightly collections cause problems with fly-tipping, odour and vermin as well as forcing people to drive to their local dump to get rid of their rubbish, increasing congestion and pollution from the traffic.
> 
> ""It's good to see here in Dartford the council listens to local people and keeps the weekly bin collections they value. It was fantastic to meet the refuse collectors who are doing such an important job as well and hear directly from residents.
> 
> ""I hope other Councils will follow Dartford's example in the difficult times ahead as we work together to cut the deficit and listen to local people about what services matter the most.""

The council received further praise for publicly ruling out the practice of 'bin snooping' - secretive bin searches to find out what the public are throwing away. Ministers believe the best way to encourage responsible waste disposal is to incentivise recycling rather than punish families with taxes, and reward them for going green.

Environment Ministers have axed the funding for 'pilot' schemes for the bin taxes. Under the bin tax laws, once a pilot scheme had been introduced, it could be rolled out across the country without a substantive vote in Parliament.

With council finances due to be tightened as the Government tackles reducing the deficit, Ministers are urging councils to increase their use of local referendums to find out what services people want to protect.

The coalition Government set out plans in its Programme for Government to encourage the use of local referendums on any local issue.

### Notes to editor

1. The Waste review will look at what policies are needed to reduce the amount of waste generated and to maximise reuse and recycling, while also considering how waste policies affect local communities, individual households and businesses.

2. The Waste review includes looking at how government can work with local councils to increase the frequency and quality of rubbish collections and make it easier to recycle, to tackle measures which encourage councils specifically to cut the scope of collections; and to address public concerns over the civil liberty aspects of inappropriate enforcement practices associated with household collections.

3. People can contribute to the review through the Defra website, by responding to the call for evidence or taking part in an interactive debate on waste policies. Information about the Review, including the Terms of Reference and call for evidence, can be found at: [www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/consult/waste-review/index.htm](http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/consult/waste-review/index.htm) (external link).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/localgovernment/1723670,No council tax revaluation tax rises pledge ministers,"Local taxpayers have been reassured that there will be no unexpected wave of council tax revaluation hikes in the next five years.

Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles and Treasury Minister David Gauke have today confirmed that the Government will not carry out a council tax revaluation in England during the lifetime of this Parliament.

In addition an independent Data Protection Audit of the Valuation Office Agency's (VOA) council tax database is to be carried out to make sure people's privacy is protected when the Agency assesses properties and stores data. This takes forward the Coalition's desire to defend civil liberties, restore the rights of individuals and in keeping with Britain's tradition of freedom and fairness.

There are also plans for a broader local government resource review that will examine the way councils are funded, to provide greater financial freedoms and decrease dependency on Whitehall funding, which has previously pushed up council tax in many local authorities due to so-called 'gearing' effects.

Eric Pickles, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, said:

> ""We are today confirming that there will be no council tax revaluation which could have pushed up taxes on people's homes. The new Government will protect the privacy of law-abiding citizens and halt state inspectors from unnecessary intrusion.
> 
> ""We are standing up for people who have pride in their home, and calling time on the surveillance state.
> 
> ""Hefty council tax bills are a constant financial worry for many people. Today we are setting their minds at ease, and protecting the interests of the less well-off in particular.""

David Gauke, Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, added:

> ""We want fairness in the tax system. Therefore this Government will avoid an unnecessary and expensive revaluation that could lead to increased council tax bills. The Government is committed to being open about its work while protecting the privacy of personal data. To provide assurance on this point, the Valuation Office Agency is commissioning an independent Data Protection Audit of the council tax database.""

### Notes to editors

1. The Coalition Government is committed to undertaking a full review of local government finance. This is due to report in summer 2012.

2. On 23 September the Valuation Office Agency (VOA) published statistics on the numbers of dwellings by Council Tax band and by property attributes, as at 13 September 2010. Data was published for all billing authorities in England and Wales, including national and regional totals.

3. The publication of properties by band is the next release of an ongoing annual series showing the number of properties in each council tax band. This information was previously published by Communities and Local Government. The count of properties with each of the VOA's Property Attribute Codes is newly published as an official statistic. These statistics are published in compliance with the code of practice for official statistics set out in the Statistics and Registration Act 2007.

4. While the VOA aims to be as open and transparent as possible about the data it holds and continually looks for ways to improve the understanding of its work, it takes the protection of personal data extremely seriously. As an Executive Agency of HM Revenue & Customs, the VOA is subject to taxpayer confidentiality laws.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/localgovernment/1736418,Bedfordshire flag to fly at Department for Communities and Local Government,"The flag representing the historic county of Bedfordshire has been hoisted above the offices of the Department for Communities and Local Government.

To celebrate the important place counties play in the nation's cultural heritage Secretary of State Eric Pickles has asked that English county standards be flown alongside the Union Flag outside the Department's Eland House headquarters in Victoria.

Mr Pickles raised the first flag - for his adopted home county of Essex - in a ceremony also attended earlier this month by celebrity astrologer and long-time English county campaigner Russell Grant.

Flags are being flown for a week at a time in alphabetical order or - in cases such as Cornwall and Yorkshire - to coincide with particular county days.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""The Union Flag rightly has pride of place outside the Department but I'm delighted it will now be flown alongside our traditional and ceremonial county flags.
> 
> ""English counties continue to form an important part of our cultural and local identity in this country and many people remain deeply attached to their home county - both the traditional 'cricket' counties and in some cases their more modern administrative successors. This sense of pride and shared identity is one of the things that binds communities together and it's right that the Government department responsible for communities and local government should be actively recognising the important role they play.""

Sir Samuel Whitbread KCVO, Lord Lieutenant for Bedfordshire, said:

> ""I am delighted to hear that Bedfordshire's County flag is to fly above the offices of the Department for Communities and Local Government alongside the Union Flag. Bedfordshire is very proud of its long history and the demise of the County Council in 2009 is regretted by many in the County.""

### Notes to editors

The Department is obliged to fly the European Union flag during Europe Week (w/c 9 May) under Article 7(2) of EC Regulation 1828/2006.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/localgovernment/1778436,Eric Pickles - Help to lift small business tax break take up,"Small businesses and local shops will find it easier to get their tax cuts as the Government scraps form filling rules to help increase take up, Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles announced today.

The normal tax discount for small businesses, known as Small Business Rate Relief, has already been doubled this year, but the Government also wants to help as many as possible claim the discounts they are eligible for.

Mr Pickles is clear that helping small shops and businesses grow is a crucial part of rebalancing and rebuilding the economy.

> ""We have already doubled the rate discount small businesses get, but we want to see as many small business ratepayers as possible to claim their tax cuts so we will change the rules so councils can administer the scheme without being caught up in unnecessary Government red tape.""

To help eligible businesses claim their tax cut in the future new measures in the upcoming Localism Bill will end the legal requirement for ratepayers to fill in an application form first. Councils will be free to administer Small Business Rate Relief in a way that best serves local businesses and local needs.

The Government will also amend secondary legislation to ensure that all eligible businesses automatically have their discounted bills calculated using the small business multiplier.

The Government is already helping an estimated 500,000 ratepayers who are eligible for Small Business Rate Relief by doubling the normal discount for next year, worth £390 million. Approximately 345,000 of those could pay no rates at all.

Mr Pickles said:

> ""Small shops and businesses are crucial to the country's economy and we know they were hit hard by the financial legacy left us. All too often the tax support Government offers is tied up in so much red tape small businesses are put off from getting it. As we rebalance the economy we are determined to give them a helping hand.
> 
> ""We have already doubled the rate discount small businesses get, but we want to see as many small business ratepayers as possible to claim their tax cuts so we will change the rules so councils can administer the scheme without being caught up in unnecessary Government red tape.
> 
> ""We shall also let councils set discounts locally and we are considering proposals to let them keep what they collect. This will give councils a genuine financial stake in their local economy and let them target their support at local shops, pubs, post offices and start-up enterprises.""

The Government has set out radical new proposals to look at ways for Local Authorities to keep the business rates they collect locally. These would give councils genuine incentives to promote local economic growth, and give them a greater stake in their local economies.

The Government will also give councils the power to set local discounts on business rates, provided that they are funded locally. This will give councils the ability to respond to local circumstances such as supporting the local pub or post office if they are struggling or encouraging new start-up enterprises.

Other measures to support business in the upcoming Localism Bill will include increased powers for businesses to hold a ballot on Business Rate Supplements. This will allow liable businesses to vote for and in effect approve the planned economic development project that they will be funding. Legislation will also be introduced to officially cancel the frozen backdated ports taxes. This will help many port-based businesses that faced the threat of balance sheet insolvency after being hit with significant and unexpected backdated business rates bills in 2008.

### Notes to editors

1. Currently, small businesses in England are generally entitled to small business rate relief if they occupy only one property and the rateable value of that property is less than £18,000 (£25,500 in London).

2. All businesses meeting that criteria are eligible to have their rates calculated using the small business rates multiplier. Additionally, properties with rateable values of less than £6,000 are entitled to fifty per cent relief. Properties with rateable values between £6,000 and £12,000 receive tapered relief.

3. Legislation will be introduced through the localism bill to remove the legal requirement for eligible ratepayers to submit an application form. Secondary legislation will also be amended to ensure that all eligible ratepayers below the £18,000 (£25,500 in London) rateable value threshold have their bills calculated using the small business multiplier, regardless of the number of properties that they occupy. The legislation applies to England only.

4. The Budget announced that between 1 October 2010 and 30 September 2011, eligible ratepayers will receive small business rate relief at one hundred per cent on properties up to £6,000 (rather than fifty per cent), and a tapering relief from one hundred per cent to zero per cent for properties up to £12,000 in rateable value for that period.

5. The Government will amend the Business Rate Supplement Act 2009 to ensure that all future Business Rate Supplement projects, both where they fund more or less than a third of the overall project, will have to be put to the ballot so that liable businesses can decide whether to impose the Business Rate Supplement upon themselves. Currently projects where the Business Rate Supplement funds less than one third of the overall costs do not require a ballot - over one third a ballot is required. To ensure all Business Rate Supplement projects have to ballot businesses - primary legislation is required to alter the 2009 Act which will ensure that projects where Business Rate Supplement funds less than on third have to ballot businesses.

Other relief:

6. Legislation will also be introduced to cancel backdated business rates bills for newly assessed properties split from larger rateable properties that are eligible for the eight year payment schedule.

7. Charities and community amateur sports clubs can get their business rates bills reduced by at least eighty per cent - which can be toped up to one hundred per cent at the discretion of the relevant local authority. Other non-profit organisations can apply for up to one hundred per cent discretionary relief and certain rural businesses may be able to claim rural rate relief.  Further details can be found at the following link: [http://www.businesslink.gov.uk](http://www.businesslink.gov.uk).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/localgovernment/1789722,Grant Shapps: Councillors being given more powers than ever to become local champions,"Local Government Minister Grant Shapps today outlined how radical new legislation will make councillors more powerful than ever before and help them become local champions.

He launched a national search for talented 'school gate mums and dads' to step forward and make real change to real lives in their communities.

![embed: ](http://www.youtube.com/v/dYNGsL4JYjM?fs=1&hl=en_GB&rel=0)

The Localism Bill, to be published shortly, will help place councillors centre stage in their communities with more clout than ever before to get things done for the people they serve on a whole range of issues. Measures will include freeing councillors from restrictions that prevent them from championing local issues, allowing councils to return to the Committee system meaning all councillors are directly involved in decision-making and a new simpler and transparent standards regime ending the system that Ministers believe fuelled petty and malicious complaints.

So Mr Shapps launched a new talent show called 'Your Community Needs You' - a search for community champions, people with the X Factor who have a track record of getting things done in their area. He is encouraging them to put their names on the ballot papers for next year's local elections.

He today kicked off this search for local stars by encouraging 'school gate mums and dads' - people with energy and passion, people who know what needs doing and are used to going out and doing it - to bring their skills and experience to bear and consider standing for election.

Mr Shapps argued that for many, becoming a councillor is the last thing on their mind, and that they will have previously been put off by the steady erosion of power of councillors and the endless restrictions placed on them in recent years.

But with the pressing need to get the nation's finances back on track every community faces tough choices and needs talented people who are part of their community to make these decisions. Mr Shapps said there has never been a better reason or time for these talented people to put themselves forward.

Mr Shapps made clear his admiration for those existing councillors who despite the restrictions placed on them have continued to champion their communities. But with these restrictions set to become a thing of the past, the Minister said he wants to see a new generation to join this army of community champions.

In a speech to parents and students at Bishop's Hatfield School Grant Shapps said:

> ""There are tens of thousands of people across the country - like the 'school gate mums and dads' - already doing great things for their local area. They have a track record of getting things done - whether fundraising, volunteering as Governors or running clubs.
> 
> ""They have energy, passion, know what needs doing and go out and do it, and are networked like never before. But many would have never considered being a councillor and would be put off by the petty rules and mindless bureaucracy too often associated with being a councillor.
> 
> ""Times are changing and Government is ending Whitehall's iron grip over local communities - pushing power down from Whitehall to your Town Hall and from Downing Street to your street.
> 
> ""Local councillors will be placed centre stage with more clout than ever before to get things done for the communities they serve. After years of tying the hands of local councillors we are now setting them free.
> 
> ""But we need talented people who can seize the opportunities this seismic shift in the balance of power presents. So my message to school gate mums and dads and other community champions is clear. Your Community Needs You. I know this talent show might be less glamorous than the X Factor but if you win the prize is huge. You will be able to make real changes to real lives in your own community.""

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7 December 2010
http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/localgovernment/1794159,Eric Pickles: Revolutionary new rights for communities will protect and transform local services,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles today announced a package of powerful new rights for communities to challenge services and preserve local assets.

The new Community Rights measures are yet another leap towards localism and the decentralisation of power from Whitehall.

The Localism Bill, due to be announced on Monday (13 December), will enshrine in law rights for community and voluntary groups to draw on when determining what happens in their local area.

They are:

  * **Community Right to Buy**. Local groups will have a legal right to nominate any vital community asset including local shops, pubs, libraries and leisure centres to be assessed for recording on a 'most wanted' list by the local council. If a listed asset goes on the open market, its sale will be delayed triggering a 'community countdown' that will give people time to prepare their business plan and raise the funds they need to bid.
  * **Community Right to Challenge**. Opening the door to a transformation in the way that local public services are run, Right to Challenge gives community or voluntary sector groups, as well as parish councils and council employees delivering the service, new powers to challenge and take over a local service. This could include running children's centres, social care services and even improving local transport links. Under the new law, councils must respond to this challenge and consider the positive impact the proposal could have on the community. If the proposal is turned down the council must publish the reasons for this. This new right puts voluntary and charity groups on the front foot when it comes to running public services and has the potential to open up new revenue for them.

Last week, Mr Pickles announced new rights for communities to shape the development of the communities in which they live, through the creation of neighbourhood plans. The Localism Bill will radically reform the planning system so local people have a greater say and influence over what their home town will look like in the future.  
   
Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, said:

> ""This powerful series of measures puts new rights in law for people to protect, improve and even run important frontline services. For too long people have been powerless to intervene as vital community resources disappear from their areas. The Community Rights measures will put control back where it belongs - with the people at the heart of our villages, towns and cities.
> 
> ""The Rights are also a massive opportunity for the community and voluntary sector to demonstrate their innovation and the new ideas they can bring to the table for better, cost effective services.""

Local facilities have been closing down all over the country, leaving towns and villages without vital amenities. Small community groups that are willing to take over local assets often find that they lack the time and resources to get a plan together and compete with the might and muscle of big business and developers, who can throw significant time and resource behind projects.

Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark, added:

> ""Voluntary and community groups already successfully provide services including education, social care and tackling worklessness. But there are many more groups who have been locked out or passed over in favour of the same old way of doing things. The government wants to see councils making the most of the talents and ingenuity of these organisations and this new measure will make sure that good ideas get a proper hearing.
> 
> ""The new rights intend to level the playing field and make it easier for voluntary groups to move from the sidelines to centre stage when it comes to delivering services as part of the Big Society"".

The Right to Challenge legislation gives voluntary, community and charitable groups, as well social enterprises, parish councils and local authority employees, the legal right to express an interest to run a service. Councils must respond to these challenges and consider the positive impact the proposal could have on the community. Councils can then put the proposals to the test about how the service would work. 

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell, said:

> ""These groundbreaking measures puts communities at the heart of decision making for protecting vital frontline services and puts them on the front foot for putting in an offer if they come up for closure.""

### Notes to editors

1. For examples of community groups and civic societies who have already taken action in their local areas, please contact the DCLG press office.

2. These measures will be included in the Localism Bill, due to be announced on Monday 13 December. Further details on the measures will be set out in secondary legislation.

3. The Community Right to Buy will require local authorities to maintain a list of sites of community value put forward for consideration by communities. The local authority will assess the suggestions before recording on the list. When listed land comes up for disposal (either the freehold or a long leasehold), communities will be given the chance to develop a bid and raise the capital to buy the asset.  They will then be in a better position to bid to buy the asset when it comes on the market at the end of the moratorium.

4. This will help local communities to save sites which are important to the community, which will contribute to tackling social need and building up resources in their neighbourhood. The Bill will provide the framework for the Right, the detail of which will be set out in secondary legislation, and subject to public consultation in the new year.

5. The Community Right to Challenge will enable voluntary, community and charitable groups, as well social enterprises, mutuals, co-operatives, parish councils and local authority employees looking to deliver the service as a new employee-led organisation, to express an interest in running a local authority service. This may trigger a procurement exercise for the service in which the challenging organisation can participate alongside other bidders.

6. The measure includes a minimum period (to be set out in secondary legislation) between an expression of interest being accepted and a procurement exercise starting. This will enable public sector workers, where they are not the challengers, to decide whether they want to bid to run the service, and to organise themselves to do this. This should also assist smaller and new voluntary sector organisations. We are also proposing that we require local authorities to consider the relevant and proportionate social impacts of both expressions of interest and bids.

7. These measures ensure that the right to challenge better supports the Government's work on public sector workers and its objectives to increase the involvement of the voluntary sector in delivering public services.

8. The local authority will need to publish its response to the expression of interest and set out reasons where it decides not to take a proposal forward. This will ensure that decision making is transparent and the council is accountable to local people for its decision.

9. Right to Challenge follows from the Right to Provide announcement by the Cabinet Office on Wednesday 17 November. Right to Provide means that public service employers will be expected to accept suitable proposals from front line staff who want to take over and run their services as mutual organisations.  
[www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/news/big-society-plans-better-public-services](http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/news/big-society-plans-better-public-services) (external link).

10. The Government will introduce a new right for communities to shape their local areas by creating neighbourhood plans, and introduce powerful new incentives to encourage local communities to approve sustainable development. The new neighbourhood plans will be flexible so communities will be able to determine the issues or areas to cover and what level of detail they want to go into.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/localgovernment/1837203,Town Hall transparency: Pickles' code to decipher middle management maze,"A second radical phase in the Government's drive for greater openness will shine the torch of transparency on Town Hall middle management across the country, Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles will announce today.

Over ninety five per cent of councils have published their spending data over £500 online. Latest reports to the Department show 346 councils in England are now online. Mr Pickles praised them for leading the transformation to transparent Town Halls. Eight are still to reveal data to the public.

A draft Code of Recommended Practice for Local Government Data Transparency is being published today for consultation, offering all councils, including those yet to comply, a clear outline of what will be expected of them.

In the new push for transparency, councils will be now be asked to publish an organisational chart including the names and responsibilities of staff paid over £58,200 - equivalent to the lowest Senior Civil Service pay band. Ministers believe this will give the public the full picture of a council's management composition.

The document also lays out core principles of data transparency, which Ministers believe all local authorities should embrace as part of the new era of accountability, including the expectation that they should publish information on salaries, voluntary funding, licensing, contracts or tenders, expenses and performance.

Councils will also be expected to respond to public demand for more information, where residents decide what data is important, so they can see exactly where their tax pounds go and how their council is performing.

The code also recommends a public inventory should be registered at [www.data.gov.uk](http://data.gov.uk/home) (external link), the Government's central information hub, in an accessible format so that it is easy to locate or reuse.

Secretary of State Eric Pickles said:

> ""The taxpayer has a right to look under the bonnet of their Town Hall and see what decisions are being made on their behalf and where their money is being spent.
> 
> ""I asked all councils to put online everything they spend over £500 and I commend the majority have had the good sense to lead this transformation in transparency. Today I'm publishing a new code that will help decipher the Town Hall maze of middle management, bringing more public information to light. This will also give the few remaining refuseniks a clear game plan to follow.
> 
> ""Transparency must be the underlying principal behind everything councils do. Every aspect of council business should be open to public scrutiny including senior pay, councillor expenses, local services and voluntary sector funding. This can help save money in tough times, protecting the frontline by cutting waste and unnecessary costs.""

### Notes to editor

1. Consultation on the draft Code of Recommended Practice for Local Government data transparency will close on 14 March 2011. It applies to England only. Local Authorities will be expected to comply with data protection law and to take a risk management approach to payment fraud. Suitable approaches are included. The Code is available for comment at: [http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/codepracticeladataconsult](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/codepracticeladataconsult).

2. The Code proposes the minimum datasets that should be released, openly and for reuse, by local authorities are:

  * expenditure over £500, (including costs, supplier and transaction information)

  * grants and payments under contract to the voluntary community and social enterprise sector

  * names, budgets and responsibilities of staff paid over £58,200 - equivalent to the lowest Senior Civil Service pay band

  * an organisational chart

  * councillor allowances and expenses

  * copies of contracts and tenders to businesses and to the voluntary community and social enterprise sector

  * policies, performance, audits and key indicators on the authorities' fiscal and financial position

  * data of democratic running of the local authority including the constitution, election results, committee minutes, decision - making processes and records of decisions.

3. The Code is published under the Local Government, Planning and Land Act 1980, which gives the Secretary of State the power to issue a code about the publication of information by local authorities about the discharge of their function. The Act also empowers the Secretary of State to introduce subsequent regulation should that be necessary to enforce greater transparency.

4. An A - Z of all the council that have told DCLG they have put their spending data online can be found at: [http://www.communities.gov.uk/localgovernment/transparency/localgovernmentexpenditure/](http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/localgovernment/1837203).

5. Experian research suggests councils could be overpaying by as much as £150m a year in duplicated bills. Publishing spend data online can help reduce this trend: [http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/corporate/1738897](http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1738897).

6. The Department for Communities is leading the way across Whitehall and Local Government by publishing all its expenditure over £500 online too.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/localgovernment/1841578,New publicity rules for councils published,"New rules to stop taxpayers' money being spent on town hall newspapers or hired lobbyists have been put before Parliament, Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles announced today.

In recent years there has been a marked growth in the frequency and scope of council publicity techniques funded by taxpayers' money, whilst local papers have struggled in a saturated news environment.

Mr Pickles has raised strong concerns over the frequency of council papers, politically contentious advertising and use of lobbyists, pledging to rewrite the rule book. He believes councils should redirect resources into protecting front line services.

The new 'publicity code' for English councils tightens up the rules to protect the use of taxpayers' money being spent inappropriately. Following consultation it sets out specific rules to stop municipal newspapers being published more often than four times a year and to prevent the hiring of lobbyists.

Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, Eric Pickles, said:

> ""An independent local press is an essential part of our open democracy and it is a vital part of local accountability, but the rules around council publicity have been too weak for too long squandering public funds and pushing local newspapers out into the abyss.

> ""Some councils have pushed this to the limits and were effectively lobbying on the rates. The changes will end the weekly Town Hall freesheets, stop professional lobbyists being hired and make advertising guidelines crystal clear so councils know exactly when misuse of public funds is a breach of the code.

The revised Code of Recommended Practice on Local Authority Publicity includes seven new central principles that make sure that council publicity is lawful, cost effective, objective, even handed and appropriate, and that it has regard to equality and diversity and is issued with care during periods of heightened sensitivity.

In particular, the new rules would define 'appropriate use of publicity' in relation to council newspapers and use of lobbyists:

  * Advertising should be balanced, factually accurate and not likely to be perceived by the public as a political statement or a commentary on contentious areas of public policy.
  * Councils should not publish newspapers in direct competition to local press. They should not appear more than quarterly and should only include material directly related to local services.
  * Councils should not spend taxpayers' money to lobby government through private sector lobbyists or through publicity stalls at party conferences.

### Notes to editors

  1. Full details of new Government Code of Recommended Practice on Local Authority Publicity can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/publicitycode2011](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/publicitycode2011).
  2. The Code was originally introduced in 1988 and amended by the last Government in 2001. The revised Code applies to England only. The purpose of the Code was to ensure proper use of public funds for publicity. Effective, efficient publicity that successfully tells the public what they need to know about the services and activities of their council is legitimate; the public need information to hold their authority to account. The Publicity Code is statutory guidance to which local authorities have to have regard in the production of their publicity.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/localgovernment/1848583,Norfolk flag flies at Department for Communities and Local Government,"The flag representing the historic county of Norfolk has been hoisted above the offices of the Department for Communities and Local Government.

To celebrate the important place counties play in the nation's cultural heritage Secretary of State Eric Pickles has asked that English county standards be flown alongside the Union Flag outside the Department's Eland House headquarters in Victoria.

Mr Pickles raised the first flag - for his adopted home county of Essex - in a ceremony also attended in September by celebrity astrologer and long-time English county campaigner Russell Grant.

Flags are being flown for a week at a time in alphabetical order or - in cases such as Cornwall and Yorkshire - to coincide with particular county days.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""The Union Flag rightly has pride of place outside the Department but I'm delighted it will now be flown alongside our traditional and ceremonial county flags.
> 
> ""England's counties continue to form an important part of our cultural and local identity in this country and many people remain deeply attached to their home county - both the traditional 'cricket' counties and in some cases their more modern administrative successors. This sense of pride and shared identity is one of the things that binds communities together and it's right that the Government department responsible for communities and local government should be actively recognising the important role they play.""

The Lord-Lieutenant of Norfolk, Richard Jewson, said:

> ""We are very proud that Norfolk follows the City of London in having its flag flown outside the Department for Communities and Local Government. Norfolk is second to none when it comes to combining a strong county identity while being staunchly English. Norfolk always has a presence in the heart of London - it is a Norfolk man that stands atop Nelson's column in Trafalgar Square, honoured as this country's greatest naval hero.""

The Leader of Norfolk County Council, Derrick Murphy, said:

> ""It is fitting that one of England's great shire counties should follow the City of London in having its flag flown outside the Department for Communities and Local Government. Norfolk is in its own way extraordinary, boasting a Royal residence at Sandringham, rich history and heritage, outstanding coast, countryside and waterways with the fine city of Norwich at its heart.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/localgovernment/1861957,Grant Shapps: Byker success story 'the embodiment of the Big Society',"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today put power firmly in residents' hands by giving the green light for the iconic Byker Estate in Newcastle to be put into community control.

Visiting the Grade II listed estate, Mr Shapps applauded the efforts of tenants who ""never took no for an answer"" and campaigned for control of their neighbourhood, describing them as ""the embodiment of the Big Society"", paying tribute to Newcastle City Council and the Homes and Communities Agency who supported their efforts.

And he welcomed efforts to ensure that, as residents work to secure Byker's future for generations to come, they benefit from the Government's Green Deal to make their homes greener and cheaper to run.

The Byker Estate was designed by Ralph Erskine, and won international acclaim as a prime example of 1970s social housing development. Byker gained Grade II listed status in 2006, but investment is now needed to bring the estate up to modern standards.

Under the plans, a Community Trust will be established to manage this investment, creating training and employment opportunities for local people. Residents would play a key role in the trust, and would work alongside Your Homes Newcastle, which would provide support and management services.

The Government will support this by writing off a local housing debt associated with the estate of up to £42m.

Mr Shapps also welcomed efforts for Byker residents to benefit from cheaper energy bills through the new Green Deal, and other green initiatives.

Plans under consideration include a new heating system so that, rather than controlling the heating centrally, tenants will be able to control their own heating in their properties and benefit from cheaper energy bills. This particular scheme is expected to cost £16m - with £11m coming from private investment.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Byker residents are rightly proud of their iconic estate, but have recognised the need for investment to secure it for generations to come. For years, they have refused to take no for an answer and have campaigned to take control of their own neighbourhood.
> 
> ""These residents are the embodiment of the Big Society in action and today, I can confirm that I am giving the green light for Byker to be put under community control, giving the power to tenants who have wanted for years to be able to determine their own future.
> 
> ""Newcastle City Council and the Homes and Communities Agency have also been instrumental in making this happen, and I would like to pay tribute to the work that they have put in. But for me, the story of Byker doesn't end there. As the community looks to get the funding it needs to maintain their estate, they will also benefit from the Government's Green Deal - making their homes greener, and cheaper to run with lower energy bills.""

David Faulkner, Leader of Newcastle City Council, said:

> ""Everybody, including local residents, has worked incredibly hard to put together a package which offers investment, security, and a real voice for local people. The decision will be theirs, but we welcome the support of government.
> 
> ""This announcement recognises the national importance of the estate and is a result of much hard work on behalf by our partners the Homes and Communities Agency and the Byker Investment Task Group in delivering an innovative solution to the investment challenges of the estate.""

Professor Peter Roberts, Chair of the Byker Taskforce and a member of the Homes and Communities Agency's Board, said:

> ""Byker is an excellent example of how to put the community in the driving seat and deliver local solutions.
> 
> ""It brings together local people with the Council, the Homes and Communities Agency and central Government in a productive and positive partnership. It also builds on the deep-rooted tradition of community ownership of 'their' place: Byker people delivering a future for Byker.""

David Curtis, executive director at the Homes and Communities Agency, said:

> ""I'm delighted that the hard work of the Homes and Communities Agency, the Council and local people, which has led to a proposal representing good value for money for the whole community, has now been approved.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/localgovernment/1866867,Councils to get final performance reward grant,"The Government is honouring the final instalment of performance reward grants, Local Government Minister Bob Neill said today.

£150m will be shared between 81 local authorities for meeting past targets and in line with the Government's commitment to give councils more spending freedom the payments will be unringfenced so they can use it in the best way to protect frontline services.

The Government is ending the era of top-down central control. By cutting targets and driving more open transparent government local authorities will be accountable to the residents they serve rather than to central bureaucratic systems.

Performance reward grants were set up under the previous Government as a way of rewarding councils for meeting centrally set targets. In October 2010 the Government announced it would end the bureaucratic and complex framework including rewards grant, National Indictors and Local Area Agreements, which made councils accountable to Whitehall rather than local people.

As part of this the Government announced that performance reward grants would not be paid for 2008-2011 Local Area Agreements. The reward grant being paid today is for agreements made before June 2008 and is being paid at a 50 per cent reduction.

In making these payments in this way the Government has struck a balance between the urgent need to cut the national deficit and secure economic recovery, whilst also recognising the achievements of councils and their partners who have worked together for their area.

Bob Neill said:

> ""It is right that we give councils the money they expected from delivering previously held central target commitments, but a system that prescribes that their performance is judged by ticking bureaucratic boxes is outdated and facing the wrong way.
> 
> ""Councils should be focused on meeting the expectations of residents not on meeting bureaucratic targets to get extra funding. We trust local authorities enough to not micromanage every inch of the way - we want local government to be accountable to local people.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/localgovernment/1903470,Freedom to fly: Pickles to cut red tape that stops the public from flying flags,"Eric Pickles today announced proposals to make it easier for people to fly flags of their choice without facing costly restrictions and red tape. The moves are intended to boost England's local and national identities and strengthen community cohesion.

Under current planning rules, only a select few flags are allowed to be flown without express permission from town hall officials. Getting this approval can incur fees of up to £335. In a speech to the Flag Institute, the Communities and Local Government Secretary is today announcing his intention to launch a consultation to allow a wider variety of important and historic flags to be flown by people keen to celebrate their local and national heritage and culture.

The last Government changed planning rules to allow the European Union flag to be flown without permission. The coalition Government will make it easier for communities wanting to celebrate the contribution of our armed forces by easing rules on flying local regimental flags. Other local flags, and projects like environmental awards, could also all be freed up from existing bureaucratic restrictions.

Mr Pickles said:

> ""If people want to celebrate something that is important to them by flying a flag they should be able to do so without having to fill in forms or paying town hall officials for the privilege. We will make it easier for people to celebrate their allegiance to a cause, a county or a local organisation if they choose to do so.""

Mr Pickles also used his speech to warn against misplaced political correctness stopping flags being flown:

> ""Local and national flags unite people of every creed, class and colour. Community cohesion is strengthened - not undermined - by flying the flag.""

Over the past year, the Department for Communities and Local Government has been flying county flags as a means of championing England's diverse local identities. Mr Pickles will stress the important of England's historic counties which were wiped off the administrative map in previous local government restructuring exercises.

On Monday, the Middlesex flag will be flown from the Department to mark Middlesex Day - and acknowledge the continuing role and identity of England's long-standing counties. Mr Pickles said:

> ""The historic English counties are one of the oldest forms of local government in Western Europe. Their roots run deep. And no amount of administrative reshuffling can delete those longstanding and cherished local identities…""

### Notes to editors

Currently the only flags allowed to be flown without consent are any country's national flag; the European Union; the United Nations; the flag of the Commonwealth; the flag of any English county; and the flag of a patron saint which can be displayed only in the county with which the saint is associated.

Other flags can be flown with deemed consent. These are a person or organisation's own flag or one advertising an event taking place in the building it is being flown from. These flags must be flown from a vertical flagpole on the roof of the building.

The department's approach is to extend the categories of flags that may be flown either without consent or with deemed consent. Any flags outside these categories will continue to be prohibited without express consent.

Flags are deemed to be advertisements and their display is therefore controlled by the Town and Country Planning (Control of Advertisements) (England) Regulations 2007 (SI 2007 No. 783). Certain flags can be flown without consent (see Schedule 1 Class H) and others can be flown with deemed consent (see Schedule 3 Class 7A). The difference is that deemed consent can be discontinued or restricted in certain circumstances.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/localgovernment/1918997,More support for voluntary and community groups campaigning to save local assets - Greg Clark,"Planning Minister Greg Clark today outlined more support for voluntary and community groups campaigning to save much-loved local assets such as historic pubs, seaside piers or precious market halls, under threat when their owners refuse to sell.

A compulsory purchase order by a council and future development as a community asset can often be the ideal solution. But community groups with viable, fully financed schemes can feel shut out of the process, left without a voice in shaping local plans, as councils do not have to engage with them or acknowledge their contribution. In revised guidance issued today, Greg Clark calls on local authorities to take seriously all viable requests from voluntary and community groups put to them for the compulsory purchase of a threatened community asset.

The Right to Buy, being introduced through the Department for Communities and Local Government's Localism Bill, will give people a foot in the door when assets come up for sale. But some groups can't wait that long and are living in communities blighted by abandoned buildings and derelict sites spoiling the look, feel and safety of their area. Communities often have good ideas for making better use of these buildings or assets but are thwarted by negligent owners interested only in rising land prices. The revised guidance could help them to take action quickly.

If communities want to bring a valued local asset back to use - for example turning a boarded up building into a community centre - they can contact their council and ask them to use a compulsory purchase order to buy the asset. Mr Clark is urging councils to give greater attention to applications from voluntary and community groups who know their area and often have innovative ideas to make the best of local assets. That doesn't mean special treatment or an automatic green light but it might mean that communities know that their hard work and enthusiasm will not simply be met by a blank face or stuck at the bottom of a never ending in-tray.

Under the new guidance, local authorities would also have to respond formally, outlining the reasons behind their decisions. This will shine the light of transparency on council decisions about assets in their local area.

The revised guidance builds on the proposed new 'social responsibility' deal for councils, announced by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, which asks them to give them greater support to voluntary and community groups and treat them with the full respect they deserve.

Greg Clark said:

> ""Communities often feel powerless when they see local assets going to waste.
> 
> ""Voluntary and community groups who know their area best should have more of a say in determining how their neighbourhoods develop and local authorities - acting in the best interests of local people - should take seriously all viable requests put to them for the compulsory purchase of a threatened community asset.
> 
> ""Community groups would of course have to pay a fair price for the asset, as well as the costs incurred by the local authority. But they should be given the opportunity to save their village shop, the last remaining pub or bring dilapidated buildings back to life to help preserve the character and social fabric of their neighbourhood.""

The new guidance to local authorities builds on the Government's determination to hand power back to local people.

The Localism Bill will give bold new powers to local people to protect and improve their community assets and will enshrine in law the opportunity for community and voluntary groups to have a greater say over what happens in their local area including the running of local services.

### Notes to editors

1. Local authorities have wide powers to acquire land by compulsory purchase, for instance to secure the proper planning of their area and grant public access to land for recreation.

2. Current guidance to local authorities in England is contained in an Office of the Deputy Prime Minister Circular 06/2004 Compulsory Purchase and the Crichel Down Rules. A new Appendix to the Circular relating specifically to requests from voluntary and community organisations, and other third parties is available at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/circularcompulsorypurchase2](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/circularcompulsorypurchase2).

3. The guidance will remind authorities that, as with any compulsory purchase, they must be able to finance the cost of the scheme (including the compensation to the owner) and the Compulsory Purchase Order process either from their own resources, or with a partial or full contribution from the requesting organisation.

4. In order to assess whether there is a compelling case in the public interest for a compulsory purchase order, councils will have to ensure (as they must for all orders) that there is a viable scheme for the asset and that there are no other impediments to the scheme going forward. Local authorities should ask those making the request for such information that is necessary for them to do so.

5. This could include:

  * the value of the asset to the community

  * the perceived threat to the asset

  * the future use of the asset and who would manage it (including a business plan where appropriate)

  * any planning issues; and

  * how the acquisition would be financed.

6. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles announced a new fair deal for voluntary and community groups, to the National Council of Voluntary Organisations on April 13 2011.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/localgovernment/1925289,Shining a light on council spending could save up to £450 per household,"Councils could save £10 billion every year if they improve the way they buy, source and pay for goods and services new research reveals today.

New, cutting edge analysis of council spending data by procurement experts Opera Solutions has revealed that greater transparency coupled with improved analysis is the key to unlocking massive savings by driving down costs.

The report gives the highest estimate yet of potential savings that could be achieved if councils secure better value for the £50 billion of public money they spend on procurement every year. The £10 billion figure is equal to £452 per household every year and equivalent to the salaries of almost half a million bin men or 650,000 dinner ladies.

Opera looked at spending on energy, mobile phone and legal services across three separate local authorities. The bill for these services totalled £13.6 million pounds. By consolidating that spend in order to boost buying power and get better prices Opera  estimated the three councils could shave a collective £1.44 million off their bills - a 10 per cent reduction.

The report argues that Local Government, by adopting new processes and making better use of spending analysis, could replicate these kind of savings across a wide range of back office functions, with no impact on quality of service and reduce spending by up to £10 billion a year. Even if only half of those savings were achieved local government could still realise significant reductions in spending. The report recommends that councils:

  * **Make better use of data** - greater transparency of council spending data has made it much easier to identify incorrect payments, eliminate duplicate spending and fraud, reduce multiple suppliers and spot where different prices are being paid for similar services. The report argues that the next stage in driving out waste must be making more intelligent use of this information, compare spending within and across different councils to find opportunities to drive down costs.
  * **Bulk buy** - at the moment spending is fragmented both within and across councils. By joining forces with neighbouring authorities councils can drive down overheads and secure significantly better economies of scale.
  * **Shop around** - to secure better prices increase competition between suppliers, negotiate harder on contracts and end over-reliance on a small number of vendors to provide a large numbers of services.

Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""Householders trying to balance their bills are advised to look closely at where all their money is going, change suppliers, shop around and hunt out the bargains. Town halls need to follow exactly the same advice.""
> 
> ""Let there be no doubt whatsoever - today's figures show that there is significant scope for councils to make taxpayers' money work even harder. We've always said that sunlight is the best disinfectant, and the availability of financial data has helped identify numerous ways that councils can reduce expenditure while offering the same or better services to residents. If councils improved their procurement and joint working on waste services, councils could afford to offer more frequent and regular rubbish collections. There's no excuse for cutting the front line when there are so many savings to be found in the way back office services and run and paid for.""

Ray Eitel-Porter, Executive Director - Europe at Opera Solutions added:

> ""As local government are asked to find ways to spend public money as efficiently as possible, we have found that procurement optimisation is one avenue that quickly delivers ongoing savings that can be redirected to critical programs and services.""

This year, as part of urgent plans to drive down the nation's deficit, central government has reduced the spending power of local authorities by £2.6 billion. Today's report, which identifies up to £10 billion of potential savings reinforces the argument for councils being able to reduce expenditure, protect the frontline and avoid a ""slash and burn"" approach if they concentrate on the savings found in back office spending and processes.

The research by Opera Solutions suggests that a lack of procurement expertise amongst council staff, lack of buy-in from senior executives and fears that joining forces with other councils to collectively buy goods and services will result in less control are putting the brakes on simple changes that could drive out waste, drive down cost and save the public purse billions of pounds.

In contrast some councils are showing the way, saving money by revisiting contracts, reducing overheads and increasing efficiency:

  * **Cornwall** council streamlined their waste collection contracts from six to one council wide contract cutting a £25 million cost by £3 million and providing a better service.

  * In the **South East** there is already a 'Best Deals Service', which enables authorities to benefit from deals on a range of products from pens to refuse collection vehicles. The service has already achieved savings for the region in excess of £3 million; and for this financial year in excess of £1 million and now intend to look at a wider range of services including telecommunications, vehicle maintenance, training and utilities.

  * In **Essex** a number of local authorities have joined together to form a shared services hub for procurement,  enabling procurement arrangements arrived at for one authority in the group to be made available to all other members - and to a wider group wherever possible - the hub also provides access to expert procurement advice.

  * **Trafford** is saving £4.3 million on smarter procurement and £2.3 million on management.

The Local Government Group's own [productivity programme](http://local.gov.uk/lgv2/core/page.do?pageId=579930) (external link) is also supporting councils to do things differently starting with quick wins like e-auctions and recovering duplicated payments.

2. The Opera report confirms what Cllr Paul Bettison,of Bracknell Forest Borough Council, and Andrew Smith, Chief Executive of Hampshire, who are leading the Local Productivity Programme's work on Capital, Assets and Procurement have been saying for some time. They've already published a 'Quick Wins' and, more recently, a 'Big Wins' strategy calling councils to collaborate to unlock 10-20 per cent savings in areas like construction. They advocate the use of collaborative frameworks to help councils join up their spending power. Baroness Hanham has championed the Local Productivity Programme, which aims to help local authorities enhance the productivity of local authority procurement spend and transform services to ensure that every penny of tax payers money goes towards preserving front line services.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/localgovernment/1937776,Somerset flag flies at Department for Communities and Local Government,"The flag representing the historic county of Somerset has been hoisted outside the offices of the Department for Communities and Local Government.

To celebrate the important place counties play in the nation's cultural heritage Secretary of State Eric Pickles has asked that English county standards be flown alongside the Union Flag outside the Department's Eland House headquarters in Victoria.

The county of Somerset was a Norman creation. Following the defeat of the Saxons by the Normans in 1066, various castles were set up in Somerset by the new lords such as that at Dunster, and the manors was awarded to followers of William the Conquerer such as William de Moyon and Walter of Douai.

Somerset today has only two small cities, Bath and Wells, and only small towns in comparison with other areas of England. Tourism is a major source of employment along the coast, and in Bath and Cheddar. Other attractions include Exmoor, West Somerset Railway, Haynes Motor Museum and the Fleet Air Arm Museum as well as the churches and the various National Trust and English Heritage properties in Somerset.

Flags are being flown for a week at a time in alphabetical order or - in cases such as Cornwall and Yorkshire - to coincide with particular county days.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""England's counties continue to form an important part of our cultural and local identity in this country and many people remain deeply attached to their home county. This sense of pride and shared identity is one of the things that binds communities together.
> 
> ""The historic English counties are one of the oldest forms of local government in Western Europe. Their roots run deep. And no amount of administrative reshuffling can delete these longstanding and cherished local identities.""

Lord Lieutenant of Somerset, Lady Gass said:

> ""Somerset people can take pride in their local and national achievements. It is encouraging to know that the Somerset flag will be flying in London this week.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/localgovernment/1940278,The Audit Commission - Appointment of new commissioners,"Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles has today announced that Sir David Williams has been appointed to the Audit Commission Board, as the Government presses ahead with the disbandment of the Commission and transferring the work of its audit practice to private firms. Options are being considered for this transfer, that include the possibility of a bid from an in-house mutual.

Sir David joins as the Liberal Democrat representative on the Board and brings considerable knowledge and experience which should assist the Commission during this period of change.

Eric Pickles the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government said:

> ""I am pleased to announce the appointment of Sir David Williams. He brings significant practical public sector knowledge to the Board. His previous experience of the Audit Commission will assist them through this period of change.""

The Communities Secretary Eric Pickles announced in August 2010 plans to disband the Commission and refocus audit on helping local people hold councils and local public bodies to account for local spending decisions.

Subject to Parliament enacting the necessary legislation, local audits will be regulated within a statutory framework overseen by the National Audit Office and the profession. Councils will appoint their own independent external auditors and there will be new audit arrangements for local health bodies.

The work of the Audit Commission's in-house audit practice, which is the fifth largest audit practice in the country, will be transferred out of public ownership after 2012.

### Notes to editors

1. Sir David Williams has been a member for Richmond Upon Thames since 1974, and was Leader of the Council from 1983 to 2001. Sir David served as Chair to the Local Government Association between 1996 to 2001, and sat on the Audit Commission Board from 1997 to 2003.

2. The appointments and extension will cover the period from 11 July 2011 to 31 December 2012. The Commissioners will be paid £14,358 per annum based on a time commitment of 3 days per month.

3. DCLG launched a consultation on the _Future of Local Audit_ on 30 March: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/localpublicauditconsult](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/localpublicauditconsult).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/localgovernment/1947298,Councils freed from begging bowl put on path to growth: Boost to local jobs and local firms under radical new plans,"Councils will get to keep their own business rates under new local government financing proposals that will be fair and benefit those that grow financially, Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles announced today.

The Government is today publishing proposals to allow the local retention of business rates by councils and to let them borrow against future rate income. Legislation will be set out later this year so changes start as soon as possible.

Today's consultation is the outcome of a review into local government funding that sought to repatriate rates; create a financial incentive for councils to promote local growth; reduce dependency upon central Government grant; and maintain protections for business and vulnerable areas.

The proposals will fundamentally shift councils away from their dependence on Government grant, where pleas of poverty earned a bigger share. Any council that grows it's business base would see increased business rates that they would keep. Importantly, there will be no change to the way business pays the tax, who is eligible for discount, or the way it is set nationally.

A system of new 'tariffs or top ups' would be put in place to ensure a fair starting point for all councils - north, south, metropolitan or district - by balancing out those with business rates income above a baseline funding level and those with income falling below it. A safety net levy on disproportionate gain will also provide extra protection where needed. The detailed mechanism will be set out later this year following consultation.

Ministers believe a new system is needed to end a long-standing problem where councils have no direct growth incentive, to build stronger relationships with business and to put councils in charge of their own financial circumstances.

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) ranked England's local government finance system as one of the most centralised in the world. With less than half of spending raised locally councils have less autonomy than Germany, Spain, Italy, USA, France or Japan. Last year £19 billion in business rates collected by councils was recovered by Government and redistributed back out through a complex grant.

Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Eric Pickles said:

> ""Our proposals to repatriate business rate income are balanced, fair and equitable creating self-sufficiency, the right incentives for all areas to grow and protecting the most vulnerable places. This is what councils want and precisely what we mean by localism.
> 
> ""It will be much more straightforward, by letting councils keep the products of enterprise we will end their disparaging dependence on government handouts, finally start rewarding economic growth and support local firms and new jobs.
> 
> ""The top up and tariff measures will safeguard those places that have relied on grant by making sure successful areas share a slice of their income - from the offset no area will see less funding than they would have got under the old grant system.
> 
> ""Central redistribution weakened local accountability, gave councils no reason to promote business growth and meant local funding was dictated by bureaucratic formula not local need.""

A plain English guide to accompany the consultation has been produced. The core components of the proposed rate retention scheme are summarised as follows:

  * A baseline level with top ups and tariffs to create a fair starting point for all: Government would establish a baseline, which could be based on next year's Formula Grant allocations, for each council in the first year of the scheme (2013-14) so no council is worse off at the outset. Councils that collect more than that baseline would pay an individually set tariff to Government, while those below it would get an individually set top up grant from Government.
  * An incentive so all councils can grow: Tariffs and top up grants would remain fixed during future years meaning councils would retain any business rate growth it generates. Councils such as those in local enterprise partnerships, or districts and counties, will be allowed to voluntarily pool business rates to enable the wider economic area to benefit from growth and reduce any volatility.
  * A levy to recoup disproportionate gain: Government would create a levy to recoup a share of any disproportionate financial gain. It could vary according to each individual council's own circumstances and would be used to manage significant unforeseen falls in a council's business rates income.
  * A reset button to ensure stability: This will allow the Government to adjust top ups and tariffs to balance out changes in local circumstance. A longer period between resets, for example 10 years, would create a greater incentive effect, while a shorter one would allow frequent reassessment of budgets. This reset could be fixed or decided by Government.
  * No change for business: There will be no difference in the way business pay tax or the way the tax is set. Rate setting powers will remain under Central Government control and the revaluation process will stay unchanged. Rate relief to the needy will be unaffected. National discounts and rate relief will continue to be supported, meaning no adverse change to such groups as charities, amateur sports clubs, voluntary groups, those in hardship, and eligible rural or small firms.
  * Tax Increment Financing: This will allow councils to pay for future infrastructure developments by allowing them to borrow against projected rate growth. Councils are not currently permitted to retain their rates so cannot borrow against them. Rate retention would remove this barrier. The consultation sets out two options. An open structure that lets councils invest and take on the risks alone or one with stronger Government controls that guarantees revenue and disregards the levy or reset processes.

### Notes to editors

1. Spending Review funding levels for local authorities for 2013/14 and 2014/15 will remain the same. At the next Spending Review, the Government will review the total spending figures for local government with a view to more closely aligning local authority functions and responsibilities with business rates income from 2015/16.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/localgovernment/1957108,Yorkshire flag flies at Department for Communities and Local Government,"The flag representing the historic county of Yorkshire has been hoisted outside the offices of the Department for Communities and Local Government to celebrate Yorkshire Day.

The Battle of Minden was fought on the 1 August 1759 and soldiers from the 51st Regiment of foot (a Yorkshire regiment, first raised in Leeds in 1755), played a significant part in the victory gained. Reports from the period suggest that the soldiers picked roses and wore them on their uniforms, either during the battle or afterwards.

The white rose has long been a badge associated with Yorkshire. Some regiments still remember the battle, on its anniversary, as Minden Day and wear roses on their uniforms. Those with Yorkshire connections wear white roses on their uniforms.

When the Yorkshire Ridings Society first promoted Yorkshire Day, in 1975, it highlighted the link with Minden Day, also 1 August, because of the use of the rose by the Yorkshire soldiers who fought in the battle.

Within the borders of the historic county of Yorkshire are areas which are widely considered to be among the greenest in England, due to the vast stretches of unspoiled countryside in the Yorkshire Dales and North York Moors and to the open aspect of some of the major cities. This has led to Yorkshire sometimes being dubbed 'God's Own County'.

To celebrate the important place counties play in the nation's cultural heritage Secretary of State Eric Pickles has asked that English county standards be flown alongside the Union Flag outside the Department's Eland House headquarters in Victoria.

Flags are being flown for a week at a time in alphabetical order or - in cases such as Yorkshire and Cornwall - to coincide with particular county days.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""England's counties continue to form an important part of our cultural and local identity in this country and many people remain deeply attached to their home county. This sense of pride and shared identity is one of the things that bind communities together.
> 
> ""I began this initiative by raising the flag of my adopted county of Essex and it gives me immense pleasure to see the flag of the county of my birth, Yorkshire, raised as the final county flag to be flown.
> 
> ""The historic English counties are one of the oldest forms of local government in Western Europe. Their roots run deep. And no amount of administrative reshuffling can delete these longstanding and cherished local identities.""

Councillor David Horton, the Lord Mayor of York, said:

> ""As a proud Yorkshireman, by both birth and upbringing, I am more than happy to support any event in that recognises 1 August - Yorkshire Day. As have City of York Lord Mayors in the past, I will be celebrating Yorkshire Day with many Yorkshire Civic Parties with a church service and lunch in the City of Wakefield this year. I send everyone in Yorkshire best wishes in their celebrations on 1 August.""

Roger Sewell, Chairman of the Yorkshire Ridings Society said:

> ""The flying of county flags outside the Department for Communities is a timely reminder of the importance of counties to the people who live in them.
> 
> ""Counties are widely used to identify locations in radio, TV and newspaper reporting. However, maps which show the counties are few and far between.  Similarly, county boundary signs have often been removed where they do not coincide with modern administrative boundaries.
> 
> ""Societies such as the Yorkshire Ridings Society and the Association of British Counties continue to campaign for the marking of county boundaries on maps and on the ground.
> 
> ""Older than many of the monuments and historic buildings on which money is lavished to preserve them, our counties require only that they are recognised for them to remain an important part of our heritage and our daily lives.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/localgovernment/1996842,Pickles hails next wave of council transparency,"The next wave of council openness was hailed today by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles as he published the final Code of Recommended Practice for council transparency which will help reveal the fine details of authorities' daily business, including senior salaries and contracts.

Already every council in England except Nottingham City Council publishes data on all their spending over £500 on a regular basis.

Ministers believe that data transparency should extend beyond local spending and that full disclosure should be every council's default position. Councils will now be expected to have regard to the Code in all their data publications. Subject to consultation, ministers are minded to make the Code a legally binding requirement to ensure authorities can be held fully accountable to the local people they serve.

The code of practice calls on local authorities such as councils and fire and rescue services to shine a light on every part of their business, from employees' salaries over £58,200 and details of all their contracts and tenders to details of grants to voluntary organisations, performance information and the locations of public land and building assets. It also establishes three key principles behind council transparency; timeliness, openness and mindfulness of local demand.

Releasing this information to the public could provide a wealth of local knowledge and spark more improvements in the way services are delivered. Faster publication and easier access for the public and companies could open new possibilities for real-time analysis and response and opportunities for small businesses to enter new markets.

The best local authorities have already adopted the code of practice into their normal publishing routines. Councils like Northamptonshire County Council, Hammersmith and Fulham and Windsor and Maidenhead for example have long ago thrown their books wide open for public scrutiny and publish much of the data specified in the code already.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""We have always maintained that the best local leaders, those with control of the public purse strings, should be open and accountable for every one of their decisions. We have abolished top down inspection making local accountability more important than ever. Central Government has a role in ensuring that local people can exercise their right to know how their money is being spent and have the information they need to question that spending.
> 
> ""But spending data is just one aspect of transparency. There is a wealth of information on the inner workings of councils across the country - from senior salaries and council assets to everyday decision making processes - and we shouldn't have to be data experts to see and understand it.
> 
> ""The code sets out clear expectations. It will help unlock more information and increase accessibility for everyone, taking us one step closer to our ambition to be the most transparent government in the world.""

In June the Prime Minister wrote an open letter to the Cabinet outlining what the Government has achieved in terms of transparency over the past year and what it intends to do over the next (see link right).

In the spirit of transparency the Department for Communities and Local Government has already released a vast amount of its data, including spending figures, contracts, Ministerial data and organisational information. We will continue to lead the way, and are publishing all 229 responses to the consultation on the Code of Practice today.

### Notes to editors

1. The Code of Recommended Practice for Local Authorities on Data Transparency applies to England only. Local authorities, including councils and fire and rescue services, will be expected to comply with data protection law and to take a risk management approach to payment fraud. ([www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/transparencycode)](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/transparencycode)

2. The Department consulted on the Draft Code of Recommended Practice for Local Authorities on Data Transparency from 7th February 2011 to 14th March 2011. Consultation Summary and all responses to the consultation can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/codepracticeladataresponses](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/codepracticeladataresponses)

3. The Code asks local authorities to follow the three principles of transparency when publishing data - Demand-led, Open and Timely. The Code also proposes the minimum datasets that should be released for reuse.

They are:

  * expenditure over £500, (including costs, supplier and transaction information)

  * senior employee salaries, names, budgets and responsibilities of staff paid over £58,200 - equivalent to the lowest Senior Civil Service pay band

  * an organisational chart

  * the 'pay multiple' - the ratio between the highest paid salary and the median average salary of the whole of the authority's workforce

  * councillor allowances and expenses

  * copies of contracts and tenders to businesses and to the voluntary community and social enterprise sector

  * grants to the voluntary community and social enterprise sector should be clearly itemised and listed

  * policies, performance, external audits and key inspections and key indicators on the authorities' fiscal and financial position

  * the location of public land and building assets and key attribute information that is normally recorded on asset registers

  * data of democratic running of the local authority including the constitution, election results, committee minutes, decision - making processes and records of decisions.

4. The Code is published under the Local Government, Planning and Land Act 1980, which gives the Secretary of State the power to issue a code about the publication of information by local authorities about the discharge of their function. The Act also empowers the Secretary of State to introduce subsequent regulation should that be necessary to enforce greater transparency.

5. Details of local authorities' publishing spend data can be found via the Local Directgov council expenditure over £500 search tool (see link right).

6. The Department for Communities is leading the way across Whitehall and Local Government by publishing a wealth of information including spend (see link right).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/localgovernment/2019440,Eric Pickles: More flexibility for councils to reduce council tax bills for hard working families and pensioners,"Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles has today published for consultation a series of practical measures that give councils extra flexibility to help ordinary families with their council tax bills. The proposals sit alongside a second year of council tax freeze announced earlier this year.

The consultation paper _Technical reforms of council tax_ follows the Local Government Resource Review's commitment to consider what flexibilities local authorities should have to help keep overall council tax levels down. The consultation sets out a series of practical proposals which will help hard-working families and pensioners with their council tax bills.

The proposals include new scope for councils to:

  * **Cut council tax for ordinary families,** by giving councils the flexibility to remove council tax relief on second homes and empty homes, and use the money to keep overall council tax bills down. Second homes currently receive a 10 to 50 per cent discount. There are a range of discounts of up to 100 per cent for empty homes.
  * **Ensure that banks pay their fair share.** Under the proposed changes a bank or building society which repossesses an empty home will be liable for the council tax on that property.

These reforms could allow councils to make up to a £20 reduction in the bill for a typical Band D property in England. Getting empty homes back into use will increase housing supply and tackle properties that can attract squatters and vandalism and blight communities.

The paper also consults on the empty homes premium for long-term properties announced by ministers in September. There are no plans to change the rules on council tax relief currently available for homes left empty because a person has moved into a hospital or care home, or has died, or has moved to provide care to another. These are special circumstances where there is a justification for a home temporarily lying empty. Moreover, councils will be encouraged to use their existing powers to apply discretionary discounts in cases where homes are empty due to other justifiable circumstances - for example, hardship, fire or flooding.

The consultation also proposes changes to modernise the council tax system and address potentially unfair future charges. These include:

  * **More flexibility on payments.** Give local residents a new right to pay their council tax bills in **12 monthly payments,** rather than 10 instalments over a year. This will make it easier for local taxpayers to manage their payments, especially those on fixed incomes, like pensioners.
  * **Encourage the take-up of electronic billing** by reviewing the documents that have to be supplied in hard copy with council tax demand notices. Utility companies routinely offer **discounts for customers who pay by e-billing** and direct debit, but most councils do not. Local taxpayers would still have the right to request hard copy documents for free.
  * **Stopping the ""sun tax"" on solar panels** - ensuring there are no increases in the council tax liabilities of homes as a result of domestic scale photovoltaic solar panels being installed by a third party supplier under a 'rent a roof' scheme. These changes will avoid the imposition of a ""sun tax"" and the need for inspections of homes with solar panels.
  * **Review the ""double taxation""** of self-contained annexes to family homes. Currently, council tax inspectors treat such annexes as a separate property, meaning families get charged twice for the same single property they occupy.

These practical improvements complement other reforms to council tax: confirming there will be no council tax revaluation which would have forced up bills for millions of homes; working with local councils to deliver a two-year council tax freeze; and giving local residents a new right to veto excessive council tax increases.

Eric Pickles, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, said:

> ""Council tax bills have more than doubled since 1997. This Government is taking action to keep council tax down, confirmed there will be no council tax revaluation and helped freeze council tax for two years. I want to do more to help everyday families with their cost of living. By treating everyone equally and fairly and removing the special tax breaks for empty homes and second homes, councils have the potential to cut £20 a year off families' council tax bills. Councils should make it easier to pay bills, and offer the same discounts for electronic billing that other companies offer as standard - this will cut paperwork and reduce tax bills.""

### Notes to editors

1. The consultation _Technical reforms of council tax_ can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/technicalreformcounciltax](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/technicalreformcounciltax)

2. The proposed changes include:

> (a) Giving billing authorities power to levy up to full council tax on second homes, currently councils can levy a 10 to 50 per cent discount. Councils can already reduce the second homes discount to just 10 per cent - we propose giving councils the local discretion to charge the normal rate of council tax. The job-related second homes discount (where someone has to live in a dwelling because of their job) would be unaffected. The Government has increased the help the Armed Forces scheme gives for service personnel towards council tax.
> 
> (b) Replacing empty home council tax exemptions Classes A and C with discounts, the amount of which would be for councils to determine - allowing them to reduce the discount from 100 per cent to 0.
> 
> (c) Abolishing empty home council tax Class L exemption (repossessed home), and making mortgagees in possession of empty dwellings (i.e. the banks) liable to council tax in respect of them.
> 
> (d) Seeking views on whether billing authorities should be given the option to levy an ""empty homes premium"" on the council tax payable in respect of properties that have been left empty (for two years or more, for example).
> 
> (e) Setting a default assumption that payment of council tax by instalments will be over 12 months rather than (as is currently the case) 10.
> 
> (f) Allowing councils to publish online the ""Information to be supplied with demand notices"", but with a duty to supply it in hardcopy to any council tax payer requesting it - as an efficiency measure, and to encourage the take-up of electronic billing.
> 
> (g) Eliminating potential tax complications from arrangements involving third party suppliers where solar panels are placed on the roofs of dwellings without coming into the paramount control of the resident.

3. If authorities choose to operate these new flexibilities to maximise revenue in order to relieve upward on council tax, the value would be equivalent to approximately £20 reduction in the bill for a Band D property (averaged across England). In practice, the value will vary considerably between areas, and will of course depend on the discounts actually determined by each billing authority.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/localgovernment/2028948,Plans for a second year's council tax freeze set out,"We know households are facing difficult times so we're helping keep living costs down with a second year's council tax freeze, Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said today, as new scheme details were published.

Estimates of the Government grant boost that every council in England would receive if they commit to holding or reducing average Band D council tax for a second year were published today.

This follows the announcement that Government has set aside an extra £805 million, of which up to £675 million will be available to local authorities in England to help keep council tax down for a further year.

This new support builds on the 2011-12 freeze offer taken up by all councils, boosting what they could get over four years to £3.3 billion if they hold council tax for a second year. The new scheme would mean that local taxpayers living in an average Band D home in England could once again save up to £72 compared to a 5 per cent rise in council tax on top of this year's council tax saving of up to £72.

The new voluntary scheme will be open to the same councils as last year. Councils that freeze or reduce their council tax next year will get a one off grant equivalent to raising their council tax by 2.5 per cent. Police, and single purpose fire and rescue authorities will get a 3 per cent equivalent, with the Greater London Authority and the City of London getting intermediate offers.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""Last year every council signed up to our council tax freeze, but with many families still facing difficult times we're rolling over our successful scheme so councils can keep a lid on bills for another year.
> 
> ""Our two-year freeze promise, potentially worth up to £72 each year to Band D residents, is in stark contrast to the years before when council tax was allowed to double.
> 
> ""Today every local authority can see how we'll back them to hold council tax steady for another year and leave millions of taxpayers with more of their hard earned cash in their pockets.""

### Notes to editors

1. Council tax bills hit £1,439 on Band D in England in 2010-11. This year, 2011-12, the average Band D bill set by local authorities remained at £1,439. In London it was £1,308; in metropolitan areas it was £1,399; and in shire areas it was £1,484. Council tax was £688 in 1997-98. This means council tax has risen over one hundred per cent - or an extra £751 a year on a Band D home. Since all other Bands are set as a percentage of Band D, homes in every band have seen their bills double.

2. The value of saving for taxpayers by area from two years of the council tax freeze scheme compared to a five per cent rise can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/documents/newsroom/1786823/2028892.xls](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/newsroom/1786823/2028892.xls).

3. To help local authorities with their budget planning, we have published an estimate of the grant each participating authority would receive. Grants will be finalised in March 2012 once authorities have reported the tax base underpinning their calculation of council tax for 2012 13. A further £675 million will go to help local authorities in England freeze their council tax next year on top of this year's freeze. Of this, the London offer of around £100 million is based on a 2.5 per cent increase for Borough councils, a combined percentage increase of 3 per cent and 2.75 per cent for the Greater London Authority and of 2.75 per cent for the City of London. Details of for each area can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/documents/newsroom/1786823/2028905.xls](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/newsroom/1786823/2028905.xls).

4. The scheme for 2012-13 will comprise a one-off payment of grant, which is payable for one year only. The Localism Bill proposes to give the public the right to veto excessive council tax rises. Councils that set council tax increase above a ceiling approved by Parliament each year would automatically trigger a referendum of all registered local electors in their area: [www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1658293](http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1658293).

5. The scheme will be voluntary; and will apply separately to each billing and major precepting authority in England (including police and fire and rescue authorities) rather than to each council tax bill issued. Local precepting authorities, such as town and parish councils, will not be included in the scheme, but the Government urges them to exercise restraint and help make sure no council tax payer faces an increased bill. The Devolved Administrations will receive Barnett consequentials for this additional spending.

6. Assuming that all authorities take up the offer to freeze or reduce their council tax in 2012-13, we estimate Government will provide £3.3 billion of grant over the Spending Review period. A breakdown of the funding for each area can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/documents/newsroom/1786823/2028914.xls](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/newsroom/1786823/2028914.xls).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/localgovernment/2044049,Greg Clark: Date set for elected city mayors,"England's largest cities moved closer to deciding on directly elected mayors today after Cities Minister Greg Clark set the date for local referendums.

Ballot boxes will open across Birmingham, Bradford, Bristol, Coventry, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle Upon-Tyne, Nottingham, Sheffield and Wakefield on 3 May 2012 for people to vote for an elected mayor. This is the same date as most of their local elections.

Where people vote in favour, the city will move to an elected mayor and hold elections. Directly elected mayors is just one of the measures in the Government's Localism Act, which ushers in a new era of people power.

Elected mayors can provide strong, democratically accountable leadership, maximising their city's potential for economic growth and bringing real benefits for residents and businesses when backed with the right powers.

Greg Clark said:

> ""Our greatest cities can benefit from strong, visible leadership and international standing that a mayor, elected with a clear mandate, can bring.
> 
> ""Around the world, including in London, a mayor has become a vital part in ensuring that a great city has a strong voice and can attract investment from home and aboard.
> 
> ""Britain's success depends on the success of our great cities and I am convinced that an elected mayor, taking powers previously confined to ministers, can help realise their potential.""

### Notes to editors

1. The Coalition Agreement set out a commitment to create directly elected mayors in the 12 largest English cities outside London. The Localism Act empowers local people to decide whether they want an elected mayor for their city. Mayoral referendums are being held on local Election Day on 3 May 2012. Leicester has recently elected a Mayor. Bristol will hold their next local election in 2013 and Nottingham will hold theirs in 2015.

2. If a city votes in favour of having a mayor at its referendum, that city will then rapidly hold an election for its first mayor. Mayors would be elected for four year terms.

3. The consultation document 'What can a mayor do for your city?' is available at [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/mayorsconsultation](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/mayorsconsultation). The consultation runs until 3 January 2012. The proposals in this consultation paper relate to the 12 cities.

4. Secondary legislation, including Regulations setting out the rules for conducting governance referendums, including mayoral referendums, was laid in Parliament today.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/localgovernment/2073781,Election date announced for cities that say 'yes' to mayors,"The Government's commitment to people power and local democracy took another step forward today as Cities Minister Greg Clark announced the date for mayoral elections.  
   
Ballot boxes in the cities that say 'yes' to mayors will open on 15 November 2012, giving local people the power to decide who their first mayor should be.

In May 2010, the Coalition set out its commitment to creating directly elected mayors in the 12 largest English cities outside London, subject to confirmatory referendums and full scrutiny by elected councillors.

Referendums will take place on 3 May 2012 in 11 cities - Birmingham, Bradford, Bristol, Coventry, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle upon Tyne, Nottingham, Sheffield and Wakefield. Leicester already has an elected Mayor.

Directly elected mayors mark another shift in the landmark transfer of powers from Whitehall back to communities, letting local people decide what is best for their area. The Government believes that elected mayors can provide the strong, democratically accountable leadership to maximise the potential for economic growth and investment in cities bringing real benefits for residents and businesses.

Cities Minister Greg Clark said:

> ""Elected mayors provide cities with the strong, visible leadership that can help them prosper nationally and internationally. This is an opportunity for each city to transform itself for the better.
> 
> ""The world's great cities have mayors who lead for their city on the national and international stage, attracting investment and jobs. We believe that mayors can help English cities achieve their full potential too.
> 
> ""This May, the people of our cities will have the chance to have their say. Now is the time to start weighing up what a mayor could do for your city.""

The legal foundation for the role of directly elected mayors is the Government's Localism Act, which contains a wide range of decentralising measures. Mayors will have a crucial role to play in shaping the ongoing process of reform - negotiating with Ministers to specify and secure the specific powers that each community needs to prosper.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/localgovernment/2084634,Liverpool first to strike new City Deal with Government,"Liverpool has become the first city to agree new powers through the City Deals programme, the Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg and Cities Minister Greg Clark announced today.

A range of transformative powers will be devolved to Liverpool to give the city what it needs to attract private investment, close skills gaps and create new jobs.

This landmark deal will create a new enterprise zone near the city centre, provide powers to help get young unemployed people into work and give greater control over land for redevelopment and help build twelve new secondary schools.

The deal will help the city compete in the wider economy, driving growth and creating opportunities that will benefit the wider Merseyside area.

City Deals are being negotiated with a number of England's cities. Instead of being presented with a set menu of measures decided in Whitehall, each city is now able to specify the particular powers they need to meet local needs and priorities.

Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg said:

> ""This first city deal heralds an unprecedented transfer of power from central government to local communities, with new powers and funding for Liverpool to do things its own way. I congratulate Liverpool on blazing a trail we look forward to seeing others follow.
> 
> ""I firmly believe one size doesn't fit all - whether it's a Mayor or whether it is a Council Leader, what Cities have to show in return for a City Deal is that there is strong clear leadership. This deal puts Liverpool back in the driving seat to create jobs and boost skills with greater economic and political freedom. It empowers Liverpool to go for growth that will benefit everyone who lives there.
> 
> ""Our cities are Britain's economic heartbeat and their success is absolutely vital to getting the whole country's economy growing again. I want to see more cities take us up on our offer and I'm looking forward to announcing more city deals across the country in the coming months.""

Cities Minister, Greg Clark said:

> ""We've said to each City 'make us an offer'. Tell us how you can drive growth, and I promise that the Government will respond positively.
> 
> ""Liverpool has risen to the challenge with alacrity.
> 
> ""It is fantastic to see Liverpool become the first city in Britain to seize the opportunity on offer. This deal will be a major boost to the standing of this great city - both within Britain and on the world stage. Liverpool has seized the chance to attract private investment, create jobs and build a prosperous future.
> 
> ""This is, I hope, the first of many such deals with our cities. For Britain to prosper our cities must prosper. I am determined to devolve power from Whitehall and give local leaders what they need to take their cities forward into a confident and prosperous future.""

The key elements of Liverpool's proposals are:

  * A new Enterprise Zone, that will create a 'City Fringe Buffer Zone' to the north of the city centre and Central Business District. This means that for the next 25 years increases in Business Rate income, would be invested in regeneration. The Government will also be prepared to support economic development backed by a strong business case by up to £75 million during the spending review period.
  * Creation of a joint Mayoral Investment Board to oversee the city's economic and housing strategy, pooling local assets including those of the Homes and Communities Agency to drive economic growth.
  * Launch Welfare Pilots to reduce welfare dependency. The city will work closely with the Government on local schemes including a 'youth contract' to increase the number of claimants moving to work and to reduce fraud and error.
  * A Secondary School Investment Plan to build 12 new secondary schools including at least six new academies to help support the local skills agenda and the local economy. The Council will work with the schools, private companies and local universities to develop specialisms to meet local skills shortages.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7 February 2012
http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/localgovernment/2126291,Localism Act: Power shift to communities charges on,"Today the Government's revolution to hand power back to local communities reaches a major milestone as measures in the Localism Act come into force.

Local people, businesses and councils are at the heart of communities and the Government is determined to put them back in control with the choices and chances to shape the future of their local area.

The Localism Act, which received Royal assent in November 2011, is driving this power shift, wiping away unpopular bureaucratic interferences and cutting red tape that locked out communities, slowed progress and stifled innovation.

Parliamentary measures known as commencement orders have brought key measures of the Localism Act into effect, including new neighbourhood planning powers which give local people a major say in helping to shape the look and feel of their areas. Over 200 neighbourhood planning front-runner projects have trialled these new powers, now all communities across the country can get involved.

The key new measures to hand back control, include:

  * **General power of competence** is now in place for all English local authorities, including eligible parish councils. Councils can innovate and legally do anything an individual could do unless specifically prohibited by law. This should give councils that want to continue holding formal prayers the confidence and legal standing to do so. This also gives councils more freedom to work together act creatively and innovatively to improve services, drive down costs and enhance their local area. Councils have asked for this power because it will help them get on with the job.
  * **New local discounts** are available so councils can actively target their own businesses rate discounts in the best way for local businesses. This can be used to encourage new business investment, support for local shops, the high street or community services. Councils should consider this new power alongside the Government's 'Portas Pilots' plans.
  * **Community Right to Build** giving communities a new way to deliver development they want. If they want, communities will be able to build family homes to sell, affordable housing for rent, sheltered housing for older local residents, or low-cost starter homes for young local families struggling to get on the housing ladder.
  * **New planning enforcement rules** which give councils the ability to take action against people who deliberately conceal unauthorised development. They also help to tackle the abuses of retrospective planning applications which have in the past been used to spin out planning appeals.
  * **Reform of social housing regulation** giving social landlords greater freedom to meet local needs and tenant's stronger tools to hold landlords to account. Changes to the way complaints are managed will follow in 2013.

Measures to scrap interfering and costly bureaucracy and cut red tape include:

  * The heavy debt burden of the **Ports tax** has officially been lifted giving Port-based businesses facing unfair and unexpected backdated business rates bills a clean slate to get on with business. The estimated value of the waived tax bills across England totals more than £175 million.
  * **Abolition of the Standards Board for England**; the bureaucratic and ineffective regime is replaced with locally drawn up codes of conduct. This frees up time and money from councils having to investigate trivial complaints whilst councillors involved in corruption and misconduct will face appropriately serious sanctions.
  * **Abolition of the Infrastructure Planning Commission** which was not directly accountable to the public. Major planning decisions are returned to Government Ministers, democratically accountable to the public. This will not affect the timescales in which decisions are made.

Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark said:

> ""Today is a major turning point in the balance of power in this country as new rights and freedoms for communities to take back control come into force.
> 
> ""The historic Localism Act is beginning to reverse more than 100 years of centralisation, returning power back to citizens, communities and local groups to manage their own affairs free from Whitehall interference.
> 
> ""These powerful reforms are the next step in breaking up the monopoly of Whitehall over public services, giving local people with good ideas the right of initiative to do things differently.""

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""The Government's historic mission to put communities back in control gathers pace today as more and more of the Localism Act comes into effect.
> 
> ""Instead of putting barriers in the way of communities we are actively taking them away, wiping out interferences, cutting red tape and giving people the power to shape the future of their local area. As this revolution in local power rolls on communities can be confident that they are truly at the heart of decision making.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1591783,HIPs are history: Pickles suspends Home Information Packs with immediate effect,"In an important step at a point of fragile recovery in the housing market, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles and Housing Minister Grant Shapps today announced that with immediate effect, they are suspending the requirement for homeowners to provide a Home Information Pack (HIP) when selling their homes.

Mr Pickles today laid an Order suspending HIPs with immediate effect, pending primary legislation for a permanent abolition. The Secretary of State has taken this swift action in order to avoid uncertainty and prevent a slump in an already fragile housing market. Today's announcement sends a clear message of encouragement to people thinking of selling their home that they can put it on the market with less cost and hassle.

HIPs are currently holding back the housing market because sellers are having to fork-out extra cash, sometimes hundreds of pounds, just to be able to put their home up for sale. Suspending HIPs will reduce the cost of selling a home, remove a layer of regulation from the process and provide a welcome help to the housing market during the recovery. It will also mean a saving for consumers to the tune of £870m over ten years, giving sellers more money in their pocket to spend in the wider economy.

Mr Pickles and Mr Shapps also said that the Government is determined to help people reduce their energy bills, improve our energy security and tackle climate change by increasing the energy efficiency of their homes. Sellers will therefore still be required to commission, but won't need to have received, an EPC before marketing their property, and the Government will consider how the EPC can play its part in the new drive for a low carbon and eco-friendly economy.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""The expensive and unnecessary Home Information Pack has increased the cost and hassle of selling homes and is stifling a fragile housing market.
> 
> ""That's why I am taking emergency action to suspend the HIP, bringing down the cost of selling a home and removing unnecessary regulation from the home buying process.
> 
> ""This swift and decisive action will send a strong message to the fragile housing market and prevent uncertainty for both home sellers and buyers.
> 
> ""HIPs are history. This action will encourage sellers back into the market, and help the market as a whole and the economy recover.""

Today's move is part of delivering a key manifesto comment made by both parties in the new coalition Government. It will mean that sellers will no longer be told they have to buy a HIP before putting their home on the market, but they will now have the choice to provide one if they want to.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""This is a great example of how this new Government is getting straight down to work by cutting away pointless red-tape that is strangling the market. Rather than shelling out hundreds of pounds for nothing in return we're stripping away bureaucracy and letting home owners sell their properties.
> 
> ""But we're also showing our commitment to a greener housing market by keeping Energy Performance Certificates and making them more relevant in helping buyers make informed decisions on the energy costs of their new home.""

### Notes to editors

1. Photos and video footage of the announcement will be available at: [www.communities.gov.uk/newsroom/](http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsroom/)

2. Home Information Packs (HIPs) put sellers of residential properties in England and Wales under a duty to provide a pack of standard information to potential buyers when marketing the property for sale.

3. The duty was introduced in three phases, depending on the size of the property, starting in August 2007 and ending in December 2007.

4. The duties relating to HIPs are set out in Part 5 of the Housing Act (sections 155 to 159). The Government has decided to suspend the HIP duties with immediate effect pending their outright abolition at the earliest opportunity.

5. The effect of this is to provide that sellers and estate agents are no longer required to have or to provide copies of HIPs with effect from 21 May 2010.

6. In order to ensure that people selling their homes continue to make an Energy Performance Certificate available to prospective buyers, we have also laid before Parliament the Energy Performance of Buildings (Certificates and Inspections) (England and Wales) (Amendment) Regulations 2010 which introduce a number of new requirements including:

  * a new duty on the seller to secure that an energy performance certificate (EPC) has been commissioned before marketing of the property commences where no such certificate is already available
  * an EPC has been commissioned when a Domestic Energy Assessor has been instructed to prepare the EPC and the EPC has either been paid for or has given a clear undertaking to pay for it
  * a new duty on the person acting on behalf of the seller to be satisfied that an EPC has been commissioned before commencing marketing
  * a new duty on both the seller and a person acting on their behalf to make reasonable efforts to secure an EPC within 28 days
  * all of the new duties carry fixed penalties where somebody fails in the duty conferred on them by the new regulations

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1608336,"It's time for recycling rewards, not bin taxes","The new Government will scrap the last Government's plans for the imposition of bin taxes on family homes, Cabinet Ministers Eric Pickles and Caroline Spelman have announced.

The announcement was made on a visit to the country's first ever council-wide recycling reward scheme in the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead today.

Ministers praised the scheme, which started off as a pilot and is now being rolled out across the council, as the right way to encourage households to recycle waste. This is in stark contrast to bin taxes that would hit people in the pocket and egg on many to find ways to avoid paying through fly-tipping or bonfires in people's back gardens.

In Windsor and Maidenhead, the ground-breaking loyalty card style scheme will reward 60,000 households who volunteer to participate with points worth up to £135 a year, at no cost to other residents, from over 100 reward partners. While a matter for local discretion, the new Government will be encouraging councils which want to get involved in such reward programmes.

In addition the scheme would save money by transferring recyclables away from expensive landfill by increasing recycling volumes and supporting the local businesses involved in the reward scheme. Windsor and Maidenhead council have involved 78 per cent of local outlets and expect a 35 per cent increase in recycling.

Eric Pickles, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, said:

> ""Rather than helping the environment, bin taxes would have fuelled fly-tipping and backyard burning. The best way to encourage people to recycle is not to punish families, but to encourage and reward them for going green. It's time to rein in the bin bullies and work with local people to build greener and cleaner communities.""

Caroline Spelman, Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, said:

> ""Windsor and Maidenhead Council have got it right by rewarding people for voluntarily doing the right thing not penalising them for doing the wrong thing - that is how we can change behaviour, improve the environment and get people to play their part in a Big Society.
> 
> ""That is why we are here today supporting the first ever council-run scheme in the UK to give residents reward points or cash vouchers for recycling.""

Households volunteer to activate a RecycleBank account. They then receive a new, blue wheelie recycling bin for their mixed waste. Residents will earn points for how much residents recycle, similar to airline miles for flying - rewarding households 5.5 points for each kilogram (kg) the household recycles.

Points can be redeemed for rewards like money off products and services from participating local and national reward partners including retailers and service providers, or donated to local schools. RecycleBank already has 116 UK reward partners, including Marks and Spencer, Coffee Republic and Cineworld.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1610193,Clark - new powers to prevent unwanted 'garden grabbing',"Councils and communities are being given immediate powers to prevent the destructive practice of 'garden grabbing' and to decide what types of homes are suitable for their area, Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark announced today.

Over the last decade, many councils have been left frustrated at the increasing amount of inappropriate development on gardens which they have been unable to prevent. This is because planning guidance has classified gardens as 'previously residential land', in the same Brownfield category as derelict factories and disused railway sidings.

Recently published Government figures show that the proportion of new houses built on previously residential land such as gardens has risen dramatically, from one in ten to one in four between 1997 and 2008 - robbing communities of green breathing space, safe places for children to play and havens for urban wildlife.

Mr Clark is today unveiling plans to take gardens out of the Brownfield category, a simple step that will dramatically transform councils' ability to prevent unwanted development on gardens where local people object and protect the character of their neighbourhoods.

From today Mr Clark will also scrap the minimum density target so town halls can work with the local community to decide what new homes are best for their area. The target has contributed to the lack of family sized homes and flats that local people need. Councils will be able decide what level of density is appropriate for their area, and work with developers to deliver the right mix of homes for the local community, encouraging more  family homes and affordable housing.

Greg Clark said:

> ""For years the wishes of local people have been ignored as the character of neighbourhoods and gardens have been destroyed, robbing communities of vital green space.
> 
> ""It is ridiculous that gardens have until now been classified in the same group as derelict factories and disused railway sidings, forcing councils and communities to sit by and watch their neighbourhoods get swallowed up in a concrete jungle.  
   
""Today I am changing the classification of garden land so councils and communities no longer have their decisions constantly overruled, but have the power to work with industry to shape future development that is appropriate for their area.
> 
> ""This is just the start of wholesale reform I want to make to the planning system, so councils and communities are centre-stage in a reformed system that works for them, and is not just a tool of top-down policy.""

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""The current system with its push for high density has resulted in developers building one or two bedroom executive flats, when the greatest need is often for affordable family homes. That's why from today communities will be allowed to make their own decisions about what homes are needed in their area, and no longer be victims of a system designed to maximise profits and minimise choice.""

Dr Ross Cameron, School of Biological Sciences, University of Reading added:

> ""There are real benefits that gardens bring to our quality of life. Vegetation around buildings keeps us cool in summer and reduces our energy bills in winter, as well as protecting us from flooding.
> 
> ""Gardens are also great for our mental and physical wellbeing. They reduce our stress and keep us fit because we can work in the garden for hours without feeling we are doing exercise as a chore.
> 
> ""Research has demonstrated that gardening can improve self-esteem, communication skills, attention span and even educational performance. In essence, protecting gardens is important to improve quality of life, and particularly for people in cities.""

### Notes to editors

2. Dr Simon Thornton Wood, Director of Science and Learning at the Royal Horticultural Society said:

> ""We welcome any measure that protects the vital resource we know gardens to be. Gardens like parks, are the green lungs of cities, improving air quality, controlling air temperature and flood risk and providing a haven for wildlife. Beyond these very practical benefits of gardens we know that gardening is great for physical and mental health. That's why we would like planning measures to go further than protecting existing gardens, to guarantee high quality green space and gardening opportunities in all new building developments, wherever they are.""

Richard Bashford - Project Manager, RSPB said:

> ""Gardens are mini nature reserves on our doorsteps and vital habitats for all sorts of wildlife. Many much loved species rely on green spaces like gardens, such as the song thrush and house sparrow, both of which have suffered massive declines in the last few years. House sparrow numbers have plummeted by over 60 per cent and we have lost almost 75 per cent of song thrushes. If more garden space is turned into buildings they will likely decline further and the wonder that children experience on the doorstep will dwindle.
> 
> ""We hope that the new measures will protect the habitats of species that have become synonymous with English gardens and demonstrate a rich eco system in our own back yards such as frogs, toads and bumble bees.""

2. The whole of any housing plot, including any garden, has been classed as ""Brownfield"" or previously developed land, in the same category and derelict factories and disused railway sidings. The new Government recognises the concerns that some people have about the loss of gardens, and is amending Planning Policy Statement 3 (PPS3) to remove the classification of 'previously developed land'. PPS3 can be viewed at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/pps3housing](http://www.communities.gov.uk/archived/publications/planningandbuilding/pps3housing).

3. Reclassifying garden land will enable councils to protect gardens from inappropriate development by rejecting planning applications for development that is objected to by the local community and spoils the character of neighbourhoods.

4. Recent Government figures for 2008 show that 80 per cent of homes were built on Brownfield land, up from 56 per cent in 1997. However, this incorporates development on previously residential land that includes gardens, which has risen from 11 per cent to 23 per cent between 1997 and 2008.

5. A study by Kingston University that started in May 2009 and gathered feedback from 127 councils found garden grabbing to be a problem in councils from different areas of the country. The study can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/gardendevelopments](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/gardendevelopments).

6. The density target that was first introduced in PPG3 in 2000 encouraged councils to build new houses at a density of 30-50 dph and seek greater intensity of development in city and town centres. PPG3 was revised in 2006 and the minimum density target reduced to 30 dph in PPS3.

7. New build statistics show the decline in the number of houses built has largely been for 4+ bed houses, with small declines in 2 and 3 bed houses. There has been a corresponding proportionate increase in 2 bed flats.

8. Councils will be able to use their discretion and work with the local community to deliver the right mix of affordable homes for their area so no one is priced out of the place where they live.

9. The reclassification of gardens will not prevent making extensions to their homes. What it will do is give councils the power to reject planning applications for entirely new dwellings on garden land that are objected to by local people and ruin the character of the area.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1612019,Shapps promise to landlords: no more red tape,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today announced that he will be scrapping plans to introduce new regulations on private landlords.

There are one million landlords in England - nearly three quarters of which are individuals who may be renting a single room out.

Of the three million private tenants in this country, the vast majority report they are satisfied with the service they receive from their landlords.

Speaking in Parliament, Mr Shapps confirmed that with the private rented sector already governed by a well established legal framework, the Government has no plans to introduce any further regulations.

Instead, he urged councils to use the wide range of powers they already have at their disposal to tackle the minority of rogue landlords that blight some communities, provide a poor service to tenants and damage the reputation of the private rented sector.

Council powers include:

  * Powers to require landlords to take action to rectify hazards in their property;
  * Where landlords resist, the ability to make and charge for improvements and to prohibit use of the affected parts of the property; and
  * Discretionary licensing powers to tackle areas blighted by poorly managed privately rented stock.

New regulations were proposed by the previous administration in response to the Rugg Review of the Private Rented Sector, but have been judged by the new coalition to introduce too much additional red tape. These included a National Register of Landlords, regulation of letting and managing agents, and compulsory written tenancy agreements.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""With the vast majority of England's three million private tenants happy with the service they receive, I am satisfied that the current system strikes the right balance between the rights and responsibilities of tenants and landlords.
> 
> ""So today I make a promise to good landlords across the country: the Government has no plans to create any burdensome red tape and bureaucracy, so you are able to continue providing a service to your tenants.
> 
> ""But for the bad landlords, I am putting councils on alert to use the range of powers already at their disposal to make sure tenants are properly protected.""

### Notes to Editors

1. Plans to increase the annual rental threshold for assured and assured shorthold tenancies from the current level of £25,000 to £100,000 will go ahead. The Statutory Instrument raising the threshold, ""The Assured Tenancies (Amendment) (England) Order 2010 - SI 2010 No. 908"" was laid on 25 March and the change will come into effect on 1 October 2010.  This will apply to all existing and new tenancies and will restore the position intended in the original legislation.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1624150,Pickles strips away pointless Town Hall red tape targets,"Councils will no longer have to work thousands of man hours or waste millions of pounds of taxpayers' money reporting back to Government as part of a new era of transparency and public accountability, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Eric Pickles announced today.

Today Mr Pickles has written to council leaders to tell them that he has instructed the Audit Commission and five other local inspectorates to stop costly top-down reports officially known as the Comprehensive Area Assessments (CAA).

The Government is committed to 'shunning the bureaucratic levers of the past' by replacing the heavy burden of Whitehall oversight with greater public transparency and accountability so councils can focus on frontline services. Independent research put the average annual cost of reporting back to government at £1.8m.

For example Leicestershire councils found they had 90 full time staff collecting and processing more than 3,000 individual data items for central government at a cost of £3.7m a year. They also faced 83 different inspections every year.

Ministers believe ending CAA will save the Audit Commission £10 million and cut significant inspection costs for councils. In 2006 the National Audit Office estimated the overall cost of monitoring local government at £2 billion a year.

Mr Pickles has called for greater transparency and openness to be the default setting for how councils do their business. They should publish all information on the quality of council services online so an army of armchair auditors can make sure services are meeting local needs. This will root out wild overspending, expensive mistakes and unnecessary waste saving the public millions.

Communities and Local Government Secretary, Eric Pickles said:

> ""In the face of the nation's £156bn deficit, Central Government needs to stop the costly top-down monitoring that is engulfing councils and start trusting them to do what is right locally.
> 
> ""Today I have instructed Town Hall watchdogs to stop tying the hands of council workers with unnecessary red tape and paperwork.
> 
> ""It is much more important for the public to know what their councils are doing than having thousands of hush-hush, unseen papers being sent back and forth between Whitehall bureaucrats and the Town Hall.
> 
> ""We are already pushing power as far away from Whitehall as we can and calling on councils to throw open their books to create much more cost effective and efficient local public services.""

Minister for Decentralisation, Greg Clark added:

> ""Too much power has been sucked out of communities and into Westminster eroding trust in politics, and sapping responsibility and initiative with stifling bureaucracy. Transparency can make councils look to the public they serve, not to Whitehall. We need to have safeguards against things going wrong, but it is vital for democracy that we reverse the years of increasing state control and give power and responsibility back to people, communities and councils."" 

Local Government Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Up and down the country there are thousands of town hall workers who want to make a real difference in their communities. But for far too long too many of them have been tied up in needless bureaucracy which has prevented them from focusing on important work they want to do and their communities need.
> 
> ""Today's announcement is great news for communities. It will help to free up workers to focus on the issues that communities really care about - whether tackling housing waiting lists, improving rubbish and recycling collections or helping the most vulnerable. And with public finances this is a shot in the arm for councils at exactly the right time.""

The Secretary of State is aware that scrapping CAA will not remove all red-tape burdens so he has asked Greg Clark, Minister for Decentralisation, to lead on further reducing the Whitehall burden across the board. Vital inspection where public welfare is at risk, such as of children's social services, will remain to protect the vulnerable.

David Parsons, Leader of Leicestershire County Council and Chair of the Local Government Association's Improvement Board, said:

> ""In Leicester and Leicestershire we measured the cost of data returns and inspection to local agencies to be over £7m. Presumably this is at least matched by the amount national agencies spend dealing with these returns and undertaking these inspections.
> 
> ""Coalition policy recognises that the inspection and reporting regimes have two major unintended effects - to change the focus of local agencies from their citizens towards meeting central Government's demands, and also, inhibiting local agencies in working together on locally agreed priorities, rather than those of their sponsoring Government Department.
> 
> ""The reduction of the data and inspection burden and its refocusing on localities is very welcome.""

### Notes to Editors

The Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister's foreword to _the Coalition: our programme for government_, states: ""Our government will be a much smarter one, shunning the bureaucratic levers of the past and finding intelligent ways to encourage, support and enable people to make better choices for themselves.""

2. The Comprehensive Area Assessment (CAA) is delivered jointly by the Audit Commission and five other local government inspectorates: Ofsted, Care Quality Commission, HM Inspectorate of Probation, HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and HM Inspectorate of Prisons. Ending the CAA process would not affect inspectorate's statutory powers to carry out inspections at their discretion such as when councils are failing.

3. Councils are being encouraged to throw open their files and alongside spending info publish a wide range of data online in an open and standardised format including:

  * information on senior salaries, names and job descriptions
  * councillor allowances and expenses; minutes and papers of council meetings
  * job vacancies that will enable people to see why council wage bills are so high and how many of the positions are for key local services
  * frontline service data - including rubbish and recycling collections, council tax collection rates and details of planning and licensing applications
  * data such as food hygiene reports for food outlets - information which is routinely collected and of interest to residents, but not currently shared in an easily accessible format.

More detail can be found at: [http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1606947](http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1607061)

4. Research for the Total Place pilots has found that across Leicestershire's councils, PCT, fire, police and probation services, there are 90 full time staff, at an annual cost of £3.7 million, having to collect and process data for central government, reporting on more than 3,000 individual data items. They are also subjected to 83 different inspections every year, costing £2.2 million in dedicated staff costs and a further £1.4 million in other staff time.

5. PricewaterhouseCoopers report ""Mapping the Performance Landscape"", commissioned by this Department and published in July 2006, estimated that the costs of reporting performance information to central Government was of the order of £2.6 million. This estimate is based on a study of four local authorities.

6. There will be no reduction to the £29bn general grant that local government receives every year meaning that they have the flexibility they need to protect the frontline. Government has already removed the ringfencing for £1.2bn so councils are free to focus on delivering essential services.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,25 June 2010
http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1631939,The internet age will help end the town hall 'non-job',"Council job adverts should be syndicated across the internet, to save money, increase transparency and help reduce pointless posts, Eric Pickles, Local Government Secretary will say today.

At a speech to the Local Government Association conference in Bournemouth, he will call time on so-called 'non-jobs' and urge greater vigilance over how every taxpayer pound is spent.

It can cost £5,000 to £10,000 to place an advert in some national newspapers. Often classifieds are filled with job titles many people would struggle to understand and many more that appear superfluous to the key services local people look to their council to provide.

The new Government will be working with local government not only to put online information on spending, tenders and contracts over £500, but also to publish job vacancies online, in an open and standardised format, for anyone to use, re-publish and 'mash up' without charge. There will be no public sector monopoly - the jobs data can be used by anyone, from commercial recruitment, newspapers to pressure groups.

This will not end advertising in the media; local newspapers in particular will remain an important source to advertise jobs to those who may be 'digital excluded' and not have access to the internet. But over time, putting job adverts online will drive down advertising costs, make it easier to compare pay ranges within and across councils, and show local people where their council tax goes.

Eric Pickles will say to the Conference:

> ""Putting jobs online not only shows local people where their money is going. It will mean they can question whether those jobs are really needed at all.
> 
> ""What does an audience development officer do? Is a 'cheerleading development officer' what taxpayers want? How many transformation officers and business development directors does one council need?
> 
> ""One council was even advertising for someone to spin for their bins last week. I wonder whether their residents actually want a 'communications waste strategy officer.' Or whether they'd prefer a few more bin men.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1633604,Eric Pickles unveils radical plan for town halls to help cut red tape,"A radical plan to banish nonsense red tape and repeal unnecessary laws was unveiled by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles today.

In a speech to a local government audience Mr Pickles invited council workers and sector experts to suggest CLG sponsored statutory guidance, secondary legislation or regulations they think should be removed so councils can get on with their job.

Piles of regulatory red tape are a traditional part of law making. But the Government has made it clear that it would shun the bureaucratic levers of the past imposed on councils and help encourage, local people to take control themselves. All 'Cut Red Tape' ideas that are put forward will be considered.

Ministers are already earmarking pages of unnecessary regulations, ridiculous micromanagement or outdated laws that need to be re-examined. For example the 1919 law that required the Secretary of State's consent if councils wanted to buy new land for allotments; three different sets of regulation governing tree protection; and guidance on the duty to carry out an economic assessment.

The coalition programme for government committed to giving the public the opportunity to challenge the worst regulations and to introducing a 'one-in, one-out' rule whereby no new regulation is brought in without other regulation being cut by a greater amount. And 'sunset clauses' will ensure regulation is regularly reviewed.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""Too much power has been sucked out of communities into Westminster eroding trust in politics, and sapping responsibility and initiative with stifling bureaucracy.
> 
> ""More often than not over legislating simply lead to bureaucrats ticking extra sets of boxes on forms but none of the real changes that are needed. We need a sensible new approach that makes clear laws are intended to protect people, not overwhelm them with red tape.
> 
> ""Today I am asking councils to put localism into action and help us cut back red tape, wrest control away from the bureaucrats, reverse the years of creeping state control and return power to people, communities and councils.
> 
> ""Up and down the country there are thousands of town hall workers and sector experts who want to make a real difference in their communities. But for far too long they have been tied up in needless bureaucracy that has been a burden on the important work they want to do.""

The Deputy Prime Minister is spearheading the coalition's push to restore power to individuals creating a more open politics where the public are more engaged in Government where as many people as possible submit ideas for change.  The Government launched the 'Your Freedom' public debate and website last Thursday.

Councils are already welcoming the chance to reduce burdens with over 240 having coming forward already. All ideas should be sent to: [cutredtape@communities.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:%20cutredtape@communities.gsi.gov.uk).

1. List of CLG secondary legislation being considered for revocation can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/localgovernment/about/helpcutredtape](http://www.communities.gov.uk/localgovernment/about/helpcutredtape/).

The coalition has already begun to roll back on swathes of unnecessary red tape:

  * called time on the Regional Spatial Strategy putting power back in the hands of local people and scrapped housing targets. Soon I will be announcing the full list of incentives to local authorities that will encourage development

  * made HIPS history and already the number of homes being put up for sale has gone up by 35 per cent

  * put an end to unwanted 'garden grabbing' putting the decision back in the hands of local people

  * cut the ring fencing and red tape which comes attached to hundreds of millions pounds worth of central government grants

  * abolished Comprehensive Area Assessments where town halls report back to Whitehall

  * handed over more power to councils so they can manage high concentrations of shared housing in their area, without putting off landlords from renting the homes people need

  * Vince Cable has announced an immediate review of all regulation in the pipeline for implementation which has been inherited from the last Government

  * Lord Young of Graffham has been appointed as advisor to the prime minister on health and safety law and practice to reduce the compensation culture.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1634489,Eric Pickles pledges to end mismanagement of European funding,"The Communities Secretary, Eric Pickles MP, today pledged to end the mismanagement of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).

The Communities and Local Government accounts for last year, laid today, show the extent of the financial irregularities in the administration of the ERDF by the previous Government. The failure to ensure compliance with EC rules has left a bill for more than £150 million to be picked up by taxpayers.

The ERDF money is allocated by the EC to help fund schemes like the Eden Project in Cornwall, the Millennium Bridge in Gateshead, and to provide grants to small businesses. In all, £3.8 billion of ERDF has been spent in England from the 2000-2006 round of programmes.

EC Auditors found instances where projects allegedly failed to keep proper records or used the funding inappropriately. The Department is challenging these issues robustly. But where there is no convincing case, the EC will impose financial penalties on the Government for these failures of monitoring and, where the misspent funds can't be recovered from projects, the taxpayer has to bear the loss.

The Communities Secretary said:

> ""I am publishing our accounts today so that taxpayers can see where their money is being spent.
> 
> ""ERDF is governed by complicated and over-bureaucratic rules drawn up by the EC, but that does not excuse the mistakes that have been made and the failure to manage properly the use of public funds.
> 
> ""The 'financial irregularities' which have been reported mean that we are likely to need to find up to £155 million to pay back to Europe.
> 
> ""This mismanagement ends now.
> 
> ""I am urgently reviewing how we manage and distribute these funds to make sure taxpayers have confidence that their money is not being wasted. And I will be pressing the EC Commissioner about the needless bureaucracy which holds up the money from being spent to kick start the recovery in Britain.""

### Notes to editors

1. The European Regional Development Fund was set up in 1975 to stimulate economic growth in the least prosperous regions of the European Union (EU). As EU membership has grown, the ERDF has developed into a major instrument for helping to redress regional imbalances. CLG manages overall ERDF in England and the Government Office network was responsible for delivering the 2000-2006 round of projects in their regions. The current round of ERDF (2007-2013) is being delivered by Regional Development Agencies.

2. The Department for Communities and Local Government accounts laid today (7 July 2010) are for the year to 31 March 2010.

3. Full accounts will be available on the Communities and Local Government website on Friday 9 July 2010.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1643149,Bin taxes consigned to the scrapheap,"Immediate action to scrap laws introduced by the previous government to tax homeowners for bin collections was confirmed by the Communities Secretary Eric Pickles and Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman.

So-called 'bin tax' schemes would have allowed local councils to charge residents for household rubbish collections or fine families for having a full bin, on top of council tax bills which are at record levels.

Local Government Ministers confirmed that primary legislation this autumn will remove the bin tax laws from the statute books. Meanwhile, Environment Ministers have axed the funding for 'pilot' schemes for the bin taxes. Under the bin tax laws, once a pilot scheme had been introduced, it could be rolled out across the country without a substantive vote in Parliament.

Eric Pickles, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, said:

> ""Bin taxes would have harmed the local environment by fuelling fly-tipping and backyard burning. It would have created a new army of municipal bin police and forced families to lock up their bins at night. These taxes are now being consigned to the political scrapheap.""

Caroline Spelman, Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, said:

> ""The new Government wants to make it easier for people to go green and increase their recycling. Rather than punishing struggling families with new taxes and fines, we will be supporting innovative schemes, like those introduced in Windsor and Maidenhead, which reward people for recycling and doing the right thing.""

### Notes to editors

1. Communities and Local Government's _Structural Reform Plan_, published on 8 July 2010, commits the Government to scrapping so-called 'bin tax' schemes by repealing sections 71 to 75 of, and Schedule 5 to the Climate Change Act 2008. This will be achieved through the forthcoming Localism Bill. The full plan can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/structuralreformplan](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/structuralreformplan).

2. An example of Localism in action: 60,000 households in Windsor and Maidenhead can volunteer to claim up to £135 worth of points a year from over 100 reward partners, at no cost to other residents. The scheme will also mean that less recyclable waste will go to expensive landfill, saving the council money. More details at: [www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1607787](http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1607787).

3. The Environment Secretary is announcing that Defra will not be further considering or supporting any pilot schemes under the bin tax laws.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1643936,Grant Shapps outlines Government support for struggling homeonwers,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today outlined how the Coalition Government will provide much-needed support to homeowners at risk of repossession.

The risk of repossessions remains high - the Council of Mortgage Lenders' latest forecast is that there will be 53,000 repossessions in 2010. So Mr Shapps is also stepping up work with partner organisations including Citizens Advice and Shelter to help promote the help available to struggling homeowners.

And today, he welcomed the support of Martin Lewis, creator of [www.moneysavingexpert.com](http://www.moneysavingexpert.com) (external link), for the ongoing effort to encourage more struggling homeowners to seek early help and advice with their mortgage worries.

But the Minister also emphasised that the most effective thing the Government is doing to help homeowners is to tackle the record deficit and prevent the need for rapid increases in interest rates.

One of Mr Shapps's first tasks since becoming Housing Minister has been to take a fresh look at Communities and Local Government schemes which provide help to homeowners facing difficulty in paying their mortgage, making sure they offer the best deal for them and value for money for taxpayers.

With this in mind, the Mortgage Rescue Scheme will be refocused to delivery better value for money, with a reduction in the grant rate paid to Housing Associations and tighter caps on property price and repair costs.

Using their knowledge of the needs of their communities, councils will help to deliver the scheme alongside their local housing associations to ensure that the scheme is targeted at homeowners who are most likely to benefit from it.

The longer term role for the Mortgage Rescue Scheme will be considered through the Spending Review.

Since its launch in April 2009, the Homeowners Mortgage Support Scheme has only helped 34 people although research to be published shortly shows that it has had a positive impact on lender forbearance practice and mortgage arrears management. However, given the low administrative costs, the Minister has decided that it will remain in place as a backstop scheme that maybe needed if interest rates rise. It will close as planned at the end of the financial year.

This follows the decision announced in the Budget to move support for mortgage interest paid to a rate that provides better value for money for the taxpayer, by applying the Bank of England published average mortgage rate as the standard interest rate from October.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""The most effective thing the Government can do for homeowners is to tackle the record deficit and avoid the need for rapid increases in interest rates. But there must still be effective help on hand for those struggling to pay their mortgages.
> 
> ""So today I can confirm that the Mortgage Rescue Scheme and Homeowners Mortgage Support Scheme remain available as a last resort to homeowners facing the real threat of repossession.
> 
> ""But the most effective thing anyone with money worries can do is to not bury their heads in the sand, seek early advice and speak to their lender to avoid losing their home. I would urge people to visit [www.direct.gov.uk/mortgagehelp](http://www.direct.gov.uk/mortgagehelp) (external link), or contact organisations like Citizens Advice or Shelter for free advice on taking control of their finances.""

Independent Moneysavingexpert Martin Lewis said:

> ""Mortgage repossession's a catastrophic threat for struggling families, and anything that's done to help them ride it out is crucial. The most important rule is get help as soon as possible - fighting repossession when they're coming for your house is a too late, instead act as soon as you spot the potential for trouble and possible arrears.
> 
> ""The help at hand means some who qualify will have their mortgage interest paid for them, others will be allowed to postpone paying both through official government scheme and improved lender leniency and a few may have their house part bought.
> 
> ""So the golden rule is if you're in trouble speak to your lender asap and a non profit agency like Citizens advice or National Debline for help plus visit [www.moneysavingexpert.com/mortgagearrears](http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/mortgagearrears) (external link) and [www.direct.gov.uk/mortgagehelp](http://www.direct.gov.uk/mortgagehelp) (external link) and you may find its easier to start sleeping at night.""

A separate report by Professor John Muellbauer and Dr Janine Aron of Oxford University published today shows that the combination of greater tolerance from lenders and Government schemes on offer has had a notable effect in helping homeowners. This report also warns that the risk of increased numbers of repossessions will remain high in the years ahead.

An independent evaluation of the schemes by a team led by Professor Steve Wilcox from the Centre for Housing Policy (University of York) and the School of the Built Environment (Heriot Watt University) is due to be published shortly showing that there is widespread support for the Mortgage Rescue Scheme from partners and borrowers and that its continuation would remain beneficial at a lower grant rate. And on the Homeowners Mortgage Support Scheme, the report shows that it has been found to have influenced the extent to which lenders have offered greater tolerance and patience to those in arrears, and that there was a case for it continuing until the housing market had recovered.

The Department's schemes are part of a comprehensive range of help and advice for struggling homeowners.

Anyone with mortgage worries can go to [www.direct.gov.uk/mortgagehelp](http://www.direct.gov.uk/mortgagehelp) (external link) where they can get impartial advice, find out the steps they can take to keep their home and prepare an action plan to tackle their own finances. Free debt advice is also available from organisations including Citizens Advice, Shelter and National Debtline.

The Financial Services Authority has also recently introduced tough new rules on lenders so repossession remains the last resort, and so those in arrears who have come to an agreement on repayment are treated fairly.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1647387,Communities are ready for the Big Society,"Only a minority of people feel that they can influence local decisions or have engaged in some form of civic participation in the last year, according to survey findings published today.

The Big Society launched by the Prime Minister on Monday aims to address this and give more power and responsibility to communities. The plans will support local areas so they can take an active part in tackling local problems and contributing to decisions that affect them.

The survey asked 16,000 people for their views on civic engagement, volunteering, community cohesion and discrimination. The results, covering the year 2009-10, show that a large majority of people thought their community was cohesive, agreeing that their local area was a place where people from different backgrounds got on well together.

While trust in Parliament was at its lowest level since the survey began, people's satisfaction with their local area has increased and there was an overall reduction in the number of people who felt that racial harassment is a problem.

Although levels of civic participation and volunteering are low, cohesive communities, in which people feel they belong, should provide a strong foundation on which to build the Big Society.

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""It's good news that the great majority of people get on well with each other and are satisfied with their local area. But levels of volunteering and civic participation could be higher. We want to see communities all over the country in which high numbers of people are actively engaged in making their neighbourhood better and are giving something back.
> 
> ""At the same time as we are showing people that we trust them to know what will work best in their local area, we are also greatly increasing transparency and openness in the processes of Parliament and Government.
> 
> ""Everyone has a part to play in building the Big Society. The Government's job is to make sure that individuals and community groups have the freedom and tools to enable them to get involved in civic and social action or to build on the good work they are already engaged in.""

The Prime Minister David Cameron and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles announced four places that will act as test beds for realising the Big Society ideals. Many people would like to do more in their communities but either don't know where to start or come up against obstacles. The four vanguard areas will be able to call on civil servants to help them remove hurdles and get action off the ground. A community organiser for each area will be trained up and it will be their job to help stimulate and organise local involvement in community action.

The National Citizen Service, launched today, will also encourage volunteering and will give every 16 year old the chance to develop the skills needed to be active citizens and to mix with people from different backgrounds. Minister for Civil Society, Nick Hurd, today announced a series of pilots to take place next year.

### Notes to editors

1. The findings are from the Citizenship Survey, a face to face household survey carried out on behalf of Communities and Local Government. It covers a representative core sample of almost 10,000 adults in England and Wales each year, with a minority ethnic boost sample of 5,000 and a Muslim boost sample of 1,200 to ensure that the views of these groups are robustly represented. It asks about a range of issues including views about the local area, community cohesion, racial and religious prejudice and discrimination, values, interaction/mixing, political efficacy, civic engagement, volunteering and charitable giving. The survey was first carried out in 2001.

2. The survey results are issued quarterly and are cumulative throughout the year. These latest results are for the last quarter of 09-10 and therefore include the full year results.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1658244,New people power to end the era of soaring council tax,"The public will be given the power to veto excessive council tax rises, Local Government Secretary, Eric Pickles, announced today.

Council tax bills across England have doubled since 1997, pushing the average bill to £120 a month on a Band D home. The police authority levy imposed on council tax has trebled since 1997.

The new Government has already committed to help councils to freeze council tax. In parallel, steps are now being taken to help prevent bills skyrocketing down the line by giving local people the final say in a vote on excessive increases. This will replace top-down council tax capping by Whitehall, which gave no choice to local residents.

Under the new proposals laid out in a technical consultation today, any council that set its council tax increase above a set ceiling, approved in a democratic and transparent manner by Parliament each year, would trigger an automatic referendum of all registered electors in their area.

Residents would be asked to choose between the proposed rise and a 'shadow budget', which the council must also prepare within the defined limit. A no vote would leave councils having to refund taxpayers or give a credit at the end of the tax year.

The previous Government stepped in to take capping action against 36 authorities which set excessive rises. Some of the highest rises were South Cambridgeshire who tried to set a 100 per cent increase in 2005-06 and Lincolnshire Police Authority a 79 per cent increase in 2008-09.

The Secretary of State is determined to reverse the presumption that Whitehall knows best by making local councils directly accountable to the local taxpayer. Today's proposals would mean councils have to defend their budget decisions and bill increases to the local electorate instead of Whitehall.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""Hardworking families and pensioners were left feeling powerless and frustrated in the past thirteen years, as council tax bills doubled while their frontline services like weekly bin collections were halved.
> 
> ""If councils want to increase council tax further, they will have to prove the case to the electorate. Let the people decide.
> 
> ""The new Government is committed to a review of local government resource, but such reforms must go hand in hand with measures to protect the interests of local taxpayers.
> 
> ""This is a radical extension of direct democracy, as part of a wider programme of decentralising power to local communities. Power should not just be given to councils, but be devolved further down to neighbourhoods and citizens.""

### Notes to editors

1. Council tax bills hit £1,439 on Band D in England in 2010-11. By contrast, council tax was £688 in 1997-98. This means council tax in this period has risen 109 per cent - or an extra £751 a year on a Band D home. Since all other Bands are set as a percentage of Band D, every type of home has seen their bill double. The average police precept on council tax in England has trebled from £54 on Band D in 1997-98 to £161 in 2010-11. Average council tax and percentage change 1993-94 to 2010-11: [www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/xls/1518299.xls](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/xls/1518299.xls).

2. The new proposals will ensure that councils know where they stand, as they will know in advance what the threshold is that will trigger a referendum. Under the capping regime, they were not told of capping limits until after they set their council tax increases. This threshold will be approved democratically and transparently by Parliament. Council tax referendums will replace the old regime of Whitehall capping. Ministers have written to the Welsh Assembly Government offering to extend the powers to the Welsh Assembly to offer similar protections and rights for council tax payers in Wales.

3. The technical consultation includes measures to tackle _de minimis_ increases, for example by parish councils, options to avoid expensive re-billing, and the mechanism by which a referendum would take place. Primary legislation is required to change the law. The right of veto is expected to be in place for council tax bills issued in March 2012.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1681489,Grant Shapps: Extra funding for councils who go for growth now,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today told councils that local communities who go for growth now and in the future will receive direct and substantial extra funding to spend as they wish - whether council tax discounts for local residents, boosting frontline services like rubbish collection or improving local facilities like playgrounds.

Housebuilding has been declining over the past few years and is at its lowest peacetime level since 1924. Taking action to address this is a priority for Government. That's why Mr Shapps has today announced that the New Homes Bonus will be introduced early in the Spending Review period.

The Minister confirmed that councils who take action now to give planning consent and support the construction of new homes where they are needed and wanted will receive direct and substantial benefit for their actions.

Mr Shapps urged councils to open up an honest and direct debate with the communities they serve about the benefits of building new homes in their area - how they can reap the benefits of development and not just the costs.

In a letter to councils Mr Shapps also confirmed that the Government is working on business rate reforms to encourage economic development, as well as reforming the Community Infrastructure Levy to provide an even clearer incentive to develop.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""We have wasted no time scrapping the ineffective top-down planning system that forced unsustainable development on communities and are returning control of a much faster and more responsive planning system to local people.
> 
> ""We will not tell communities how or where to build, or how they should grow. But the New Homes Bonus will ensure that those communities that go for growth reap the benefits of development, not just the costs.
> 
> ""With housebuilding falling to its lowest level since 1924, action is needed now to build the homes the country needs. That's why these new powerful incentives to build will be introduced early in the Spending Review period. And it's why I have confirmed that those councils who go for growth by providing planning permission now will reap the rewards. So I urge councils to seize the moment and open up a debate with their communities now about the new homes they need and how they would use the new Bonus.""

The Government wants to hear the views of councils, communities and industry as it finalises the scheme. A consultation paper on the final scheme will be published following the spending review.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1682879,Eric Pickles - New era of transparency will bring about a revolution in town hall openness and accountability,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles and Local Government Association Chair Baroness Eaton joined forces today to urge all councils to publish details of all spending over £500 in full and online as part of wider action to bring about a revolution in town hall openness and accountability.

The call for greater disclosure on spending is just one of a series of sweeping measures detailed in a letter being sent to councils by the Secretary of State today. He makes clear that transparency and openness should be the default setting for the way councils do business, and calls on local government to move at speed to adopt this new approach.

The letter sets out proposals for a move to open local government. Councils are being encouraged to throw open their files and publish, alongside spending data, information on salaries, job titles, allowances and expenses, minutes of meetings and more.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""Getting council business out in the open will revolutionise local government.  Local people should be able to hold politicians and public bodies to account over how their hard earned cash is being spent and decisions made on their behalf. They can only do that effectively if they have the information they need at their fingertips.
> 
> ""The public should be able to see where their money goes and what it delivers. The swift and simple changes we are calling for today will unleash an army of armchair auditors and quite rightly make those charged with doling out the pennies stop and think twice about whether they are getting value for money.
> 
> ""Throwing open the council books will open the door to new businesses and encourage greater innovation and entrepreneurism. Organisations that might have been effectively locked out before, including voluntary sector and small business, will be in a much stronger position to pitch for contracts and bring new ideas and solutions to the table.""

By September councils will be expected to make details of spending on all goods and services - from car hire to consultancy fees from storage to software costs - that fall above the £500 threshold available for the public to see and scrutinise. All councils should be doing this as a matter of course by the start of next year, as well as publishing invitations to tender and final contracts on projects over £500.

Financial disclosure will act as a trigger enabling local taxpayers to see how councils are using public money, shine a spotlight on waste, establish greater accountability and efficiency, open up new markets and improve access for small and local business and the voluntary sector.

But making spending data public is just the tip of the iceberg. Building on excellent work already under way in some councils, the route map sets down a plan of action that will see a wealth of data being made available online including:

  * **Local government salaries** - Government will consult on greater disclosure of senior staff salaries by name and job descriptions
  * **Councillor allowances and expenses** - Greater clarity on councillors' costs
  * **Council minutes and papers** - consistent publication of what is being discussed and what has been decided
  * **Job vacancies** - showing local people what kind of jobs are contributing to the wage bill, driving down advertising costs and allowing comparison of pay ranges
  * **Frontline service data** - including rubbish and recycling rates, council tax collection rates and details of major planned projects
  * **Licensing applications and decisions** - giving residents more clarity on what was happening in their area and an early opportunity to raise concerns or objections
  * **Planning applications and decisions** - making sure residents have online access to information about planning applications that could affect them and the look and feel of their area, and making it easier for them to influence emerging development ideas
  * **Food hygiene reports for food outlets** - one example of information which is routinely collected and of interest to residents, but not currently shared in an easily accessible format

Some of this information is already in the public domain but not always in a format that makes it easy to be republished, re-used or mashed up by outside groups, without charge or copyright hindrance. A key part of the change will be getting information in the public domain in a standardised format.

The Local Government Association will work closely with its member councils to help them deliver on this agenda.

Baroness Eaton, Chairman of the Local Government Association said:

> ""Local government is absolutely committed to the highest standards of transparency. Councils have been leading the way in giving taxpayers real, detailed and vital information about how their money is spent. All public bodies must be scrutinised for the spending decisions they make, and the LGA will work with councils to pioneer an approach of openness and accountability.""

The changes being outlined today reflect changes being made in central government to reveal previously hidden details of Whitehall spending and information.

The Government is committed to bringing about a radical devolution of power to local government including freedom from central control, greater flexibility over spending and less red tape. The changes will put councils in the driving seat when it comes to meeting the needs of residents but greater powers must be accompanied with greater accountability.

The move to greater accountability is set against changes to significantly cut the inspection burden. The abolition of the bureaucratic and over burdensome Comprehensive Area Assessment regime will save councils up to £39 million a year, which is equivalent to 151,000 working days.

### Notes to editors

1. The Government is looking to progress this agenda quickly and has set out a timetable for change:

  * Initial guidelines about how to publish payments over £500 will be produced by developers, and published online at [www.data.gov.uk](http://www.data.gov.uk/) (external link) for comment and debate.
  * This will be followed by guidelines on how to publish contracts and invitations to tender over £500.
  * In **September** draft Codes of Practice on payments over £500 and contracts/invitations to tender over £500, informed by the online discussions, will be published for formal consultation.
  * Final Codes of Practice will be published in **November**, so all authorities are able to publish in **January 2011**.

The broader push on transparency will be an iterative process, driven by the local government and developer sector within the framework set out by government. The route to more transparency and open local government will include work on: types of information and data to be published; standardisation of information and data; types of bodies publishing information and data; proposals for the 'Right to Government data' Bill; reduction in top down assessment and inspection so that citizens take on that role; proposals for greater local accountability; proposals for simplified approach in accessing data.

2. The measures being set out today build on previous action taken to increase accountability and transparency in Local Government including:

  * **The Public Bodies (Admission to Meetings) Act 1960:** This opened up meetings to the public, allowing members of the public and press to attend meetings of certain public bodies
  * **Local Government Act 1972:** the requirement for councillors to make declarations of interest. Also access to agendas documents and reports Sec.100 (b)
  * **Local Government Planning and Land Act 1980:** S.96 provides for registers of land holdings held under that act to be made available. The aim of the register is to list  land holdings of local government bodies which, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, are being under-utilised and make that list available to the public
  * **The Local Government (Access to Information) Act 1985:** an Act to provide for greater public access to local authority meetings reports and documents subject to specified confidentiality provisions; to give local authorities duties to publish certain information; and for related purposes.
  * **Local Government Housing Act 1989 - The Local Authorities (Members' Allowances) (England) (Amendment) Regulations 1991 (as amended):** the regulations place certain duties on local authorities in connection with publishing the recommendations made by their independent remuneration panel, their scheme of allowances and the actual allowances paid to any member in any given year
  * **Local Government Finance Act 1992:** allows rights of members of the public to obtain information with respect to local domestic rating lists
  * **Freedom of Information Act 2000:** allows access to information held by public authorities
  * **Local Government Act 2000:** makes provision for access to information held by local authority executives e.g. leaders, elected mayors

3. A number of public sector bodies have already wholeheartedly embraced the transparency agenda. Making use of existing information and simple technology has led to greater openness which in turn is helping to weed out and cut down waste and increase efficiency. Local people and organisations are already using the information out there to create applications and strengthen the links between the citizen and the council.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1685201,Eric Pickles: Blazing a trail on spending transparency,"The Secretary of State opens the books to an army of armchair auditors as all Departmental spending over £500 goes online.

Eric Pickles turns the spotlight on spending firmly on his own department today as details of how £314 million of taxpayer money was spent by the Department for Communities and Local Government last year are published for the first time.

The decision by the Secretary of State to make spending data more freely available makes the Communities Department a trailblazer for transparency within Whitehall and ahead of local government.

Every item of Departmental spending on goods and services over £500 in 2009/10 has been put online, allowing the public to see what was purchased, for how much and from whom.

Previously unseen Department data shows 1900 separate items of expenditure totalling £314 million. This includes £635,000 on taxis and cars and nearly £310,000 on catering and food.

The figures also show that the Department last year spent £16m on marketing, advertising, promotion and events.

The Secretary of State has asked the main Departmental Arms Length Bodies to open their books too. Information on these seventeen organisations gives detail of another £337million of spending.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""Greater openness in spending is the best way to root out waste, spot duplication and increase value for money. That is why I have been asking councils to 'show me the money' so local taxpayers can see where their hard earned cash is going.
> 
> ""Now it's our turn. I don't believe in one rule for councils and one for this Department. Central Government spends billions of tax pounds every year and transparency at this level of spending is just as important.
> 
> ""This Department, like the rest of Whitehall, needs to look at where every penny is going and getting this data out in the open will help that process.
> 
> ""The simple task of putting spending online will open the doors to an army of armchair auditors who will be able to see at a glance exactly where millions of pounds spent last year went. The public and the press can go through the books and hold Ministers to account for how taxpayers' money is being spent.
> 
> ""The data is already highlighting how we need to do things differently. That means spending more carefully, getting better deals and asking ourselves at every turn whether every purchase is needed and whether it provides value for the taxpayers' pound. Looking at last year's spending it is clear that there is room for improvement.""

Today's publication follows on from new requirements on local authorities to improve transparency and publish their spending information. Eric Pickles has called for all town hall spending on goods and services above £500 to be out online by January. Twenty eight Local Authorities have already done this and more detail can be found at [www.communities.gov.uk/localgovernment/transparency/localgovernmentexpenditure/](http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1685201).

As part of the new Government's commitment to transparency, accountability and openness, all central government departments are required to publish spending over £25,000 online from November 2010. The Secretary of State thinks that having set the bar at £500 for town halls, his own Department should play by the same rules. Communities and Local Government is the first government department to make such a move.

In September (ahead of deadline) CLG will publish spend data for the first quarter of 2010.  From the November deadline, Communities and Local Government and its Arms Length Bodies will put details of all spending over £500 online as a matter of routine at the end of each month.

Greater openness of government data is part of wider plans to identify waste, reduce public spending and protect frontline services. The Department for Communities and Local Government is announcing today that £32m in year savings will be made following a review of spending decisions and pilot programmes.

In May, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury wrote to Secretaries of State asking them to re-examine all pilot schemes within their respective departments to evaluate whether they represented value for money and would deliver robust findings with a view to stopping those which did not. Consequently Communities and Local Government is today announcing that 5 pilot schemes will be discontinued saving £3m.

A further £29m savings have been identified following a review of all spending decisions since January 1st this year. Ministers have sought to cancel or suspend projects which are not affordable, do not represent good value for money, or which did not reflect the Government's priorities.

The £32m savings announced today are in addition to £6.2bn savings announced by the Chief Secretary in June.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1688111,Eric Pickles to disband Audit Commission in new era of town hall transparency,"Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles has today announced plans to disband the Audit Commission and refocus audit on helping local people hold councils and local public bodies to account for local spending decisions. The changes will pass power down to people, replace bureaucratic accountability with democratic accountability and save the taxpayer £50 million a year.

The new Government will set in train measures to radically scale back centrally imposed, bureaucratic and costly inspection and auditing, saving council taxpayers money. The audit expertise of the Commission will be moved into the private sector.

The Audit Commission's responsibilities for overseeing and delivering local audit and inspections will stop; the Commission's research activities will end; audit functions will be moved to the private sector; councils will be free to appoint their own independent external auditors from a more competitive and open market; and there will be a new audit framework for local health bodies. This will save council taxpayers' money and decentralise power.

Ministers believe that the work of the Commission has increasingly become less focused on accountability to citizens and more on reporting upwards to Government, judging services largely against top down Government imposed targets.

As a result of the changes, the Audit Commission's in-house audit practice, which is the fifth largest audit practice in the country, will be transferred out of public ownership. A range of options will be developed for converting the audit practice into a business independent of Government which could be sold or otherwise transferred into the private sector.

A new decentralised audit regime will be established, replacing the Audit Commission and providing genuine support for local democratic accountability. This new decentralised approach, applicable to local government, police, and local health bodies, will:

  * **Shift power from Westminster to people**: Local people, not Whitehall, will now be the audience for the assurances audit gives on local spending decisions. The Government is committed to promoting decentralisation and democratic engagement and ending the era of top-down government by giving new powers to local councils, communities, neighbourhoods and individuals. This needs to be underpinned by audit reporting not upwards to Whitehall departments but to local people.
  * **Citizens' rights**: The powers of the separate Local Government Ombudsman will be strengthened, to give residents greater rights when local services go wrong.
  * **Save the taxpayer over £50 million a year**: This will include saving the central and corporate costs of the Audit Commission, currently paid for by the Commission's fees including a surcharge on audits, including those by private firms. In addition, councils will be able to appoint their own independent external auditors from a more competitive and open market among audit firms, reducing costs.
  * **Maintain auditing standards**: Councils and local health bodies will still be subject to robust auditing. Protections will be developed to ensure independence, competence and quality, including audit quality regulated within a statutory framework, overseen by the National Audit Office and profession. The Commission's research activities would stop; ending duplication with others and strengthening the National Audit Office's role in this area.
  * **Protecting children and the vulnerable**: Inspection and intervention will remain for the most vulnerable to protect public welfare, including children's services and adult social care.

Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Eric Pickles said:

> ""The corporate centre of the Audit Commission has lost its way. Rather than being a watchdog that champions taxpayers' interests, it has become the creature of the Whitehall state.
> 
> ""We need to redress this balance. Audit should remain to ensure taxpayers' money is properly spent, but this can be done in a competitive environment, drawing on professional audit expertise across the country. I want to see the Commission's auditing function become independent of Government, competing for future audit business from the public and private sector.
> 
> ""These proposed changes go hand in hand with plans to create an army of armchair auditors - local people able to hold local bodies to account for the way their tax pounds are spent and what that money is delivering.""

### Notes to editors

1. For local government these changes are part of the Government's wider focus on transparency that will bring about a revolution in town hall openness and accountability. Local people will now be the audience for assurances that their council is spending money wisely, that they are well governed, their council is financially robust, achieving value for money and providing accurate information and data.

2. This will complement plans to strengthen individual citizens' rights of redress should they receive poor council services by enhancing the role of the Local Government Ombudsman through making his findings legally enforceable.

3. District auditors will retain a duty for reporting issues in the public interest. They will be able to undertake special investigations where they, the local government sector or any continuing inspectorates such as Ofsted in the case of children's services, or Care Quality Commission on adult social care, raise concerns about a council. Following any such investigations auditors will report locally and be able to make recommendations to the council, the sector, inspectorates, and if necessary to Government.

4. For the NHS, plans are being developed to establish a new audit framework for local health bodies. Audit changes in health will be consistent with vision set out in Equity and Excellence: Liberating the NHS designed to provide assurances that support the democratic accountability now proposed, and the accountability and responsibilities of the new NHS Commissioning Board and Monitor as economic regulator. The new framework will not compromise the Department for Health requirement to report to Parliament. The expectation is that greater use will be made of competitive open market auditor appointments, with appropriate protections to ensure quality and independence.

5. For the police these changes will ensure there continues to be robust arrangements for audit, the detail of which is being developed as proposals for directly elected Police and Crime Commissioners are taken forward. These audit arrangements will complement the responsibilities of Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary, which will continue to oversee the police.

6. Communities and Local Government will now be working closely with the Audit Commission, the accountancy profession, and the local government and health sectors to develop the detailed design of the new systems. We intend to seek the necessary legislation in this Parliamentary session.

7. The aim is for such a system to be in place from the 2012/13 financial year, with the necessary legislation being sought in this Parliamentary session.

8. The NAO is independent of government and the auditor of central government bodies. The NAO is therefore well placed to provide the oversight role for the audit of local government and health and would need to be able to rely on the work of local auditors when forming its audit opinion on the adequacy of assurance provided by departments. Combined with its existing functions, the oversight role would enable the NAO to report to Parliament on the quality of audit across the local government and health sectors, and on the economy, efficiency, effectiveness, and productivity of these sectors.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1695250,Minister praises Dartford for binning fortnightly collections,"Local Government Minister Bob Neill praised Dartford Council for listening to the public on keeping weekly bin collections alive on a visit to the area today.

Mr Neill applauded the innovative public poll that showed 94.5 per cent of residents who took part wanted to keep weekly collections, and urged other councils to follow suit. Councils across the country have been moving to fortnightly collections over the past few years despite public support for weekly rounds.

Mr Neill today pledged that the Government will be legislating in November's Localism Bill to allow local residents to initiate local referendums.

The Government is currently carrying out a comprehensive review of all waste policy from product package to waste collection. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has already withdrawn Audit Commission guidance encouraging councils to switch to fortnightly collections and laid out plans to remove the bin tax laws from the statute books.

Mr Neill met refuse collectors on their collection round in Joydens Wood today and spoke to some of the residents who voted to keep weekly collections in the 'Big Bin Vote'.

Mr Neill said:

> ""The binman has never been so welcome as now with so many councils cutting weekly collections. Fortnightly collections cause problems with fly-tipping, odour and vermin as well as forcing people to drive to their local dump to get rid of their rubbish, increasing congestion and pollution from the traffic.
> 
> ""It's good to see here in Dartford the council listens to local people and keeps the weekly bin collections they value. It was fantastic to meet the refuse collectors who are doing such an important job as well and hear directly from residents.
> 
> ""I hope other Councils will follow Dartford's example in the difficult times ahead as we work together to cut the deficit and listen to local people about what services matter the most.""

The council received further praise for publicly ruling out the practice of 'bin snooping' - secretive bin searches to find out what the public are throwing away. Ministers believe the best way to encourage responsible waste disposal is to incentivise recycling rather than punish families with taxes, and reward them for going green.

Environment Ministers have axed the funding for 'pilot' schemes for the bin taxes. Under the bin tax laws, once a pilot scheme had been introduced, it could be rolled out across the country without a substantive vote in Parliament.

With council finances due to be tightened as the Government tackles reducing the deficit, Ministers are urging councils to increase their use of local referendums to find out what services people want to protect.

The coalition Government set out plans in its Programme for Government to encourage the use of local referendums on any local issue.

### Notes to editor

1. The Waste review will look at what policies are needed to reduce the amount of waste generated and to maximise reuse and recycling, while also considering how waste policies affect local communities, individual households and businesses.

2. The Waste review includes looking at how government can work with local councils to increase the frequency and quality of rubbish collections and make it easier to recycle, to tackle measures which encourage councils specifically to cut the scope of collections; and to address public concerns over the civil liberty aspects of inappropriate enforcement practices associated with household collections.

3. People can contribute to the review through the Defra website, by responding to the call for evidence or taking part in an interactive debate on waste policies. Information about the Review, including the Terms of Reference and call for evidence, can be found at: [www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/consult/waste-review/index.htm](http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/consult/waste-review/index.htm) (external link).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1695612,Communities Minister commemorates the Abolition of the Slave Trade,"Communities Minister Andrew Stunell will today take part in a ceremony to mark the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade. The event, taking place at the Liverpool International Slavery Museum, will promote understanding of the slave trade and the consequences being felt today.

Mr Stunell's speech will emphasise the importance of addressing the challenges of modern day slavery, discrimination and disadvantage and the Government's commitment to tackling race inequality.

Mr Stunell said:

> ""Acceptance and understanding of our past is important in moving towards a future which is free of intolerance and racism.
> 
> ""The Government is committed to working to combat racial discrimination, as well as equality for all. We are also helping fight modern day slavery by addressing the root causes - poverty and inequality - in the developing world.""

Carnivals and performances are being held today in Bristol and London and will be followed by a programme of educational events throughout the year.

Communities and Local Government want to break down the barriers that small voluntary and community organisations can face. The Minister will announce that workshops are to be held in the autumn which will help Black and Minority Ethnic-led organisations access funding for educational and heritage events (including those on the remembrance of slavery and the slave trade).

### Notes to editors

1. 23 August is the International Day for Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its Abolition. 23 August commemorates an uprising of enslaved Africans on the island of Saint Domingue (modern Haiti) in 1791, an act of rebellion which marked the beginning of the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade. The date has been designated by UNESCO as Slavery Remembrance Day, a reminder that enslaved Africans were the main agents of their own liberation.

2. The International Slavery Museum is the only museum in the UK that's dedicated to the transatlantic slave trade and its modern-day legacies. It holds slavery-related collections from around the world, and its exhibitions focus on current issues such as racism and human trafficking. The museum acts as an international hub for resources on human rights issues, both past and present.

3. Through the work of the Department for International Development, the Government is helping to address issues of poverty and inequality. As well as commemorating the past, the Government wants to ensure that we gain the best possible legacy from the commemoration of 23 August by focusing on what still needs to happen in order to tackle:

  * inequality, discrimination and racism in Britain today, in particular for people of African and Caribbean heritage

  * poverty and inequality on the African continent and in the Caribbean

  * contemporary slavery in all its forms.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1698778,Safe rooms help stop domestic violence victims becoming homeless,"New research and statistics published today show that whilst domestic violence is one the major reasons families become homeless, protection measures such as safe rooms are very effective in helping these families to safely stay in their homes.

Under what are known as 'Sanctuary Schemes', victims of domestic violence have special security measures installed to keep families safe in their own homes in case the aggressor tries to return. Depending on the specific needs of the family at risk, this might mean creating a safe room in the house which is secured using a reinforced door which opens outwards so an intruder can't kick-it in. 

In other cases, councils and the police might install video entry systems and alarms which automatically alert the nearest police station ensuring a rapid response. These security measures combined with other essential support from specialist domestic violence service providers have proved crucial in keeping households safe.

The research by the University of York shows that Sanctuary Schemes, supported by other agencies, such as the police and local councils, have been hugely successful in helping families stay safe in their own homes. This often means families avoid the upheaval of having to leave their home and support networks and the risk of becoming homeless.

Statistics also released today show that in 2009 there were over 5,000 cases that were prevented from becoming homeless home thanks to the protection of a sanctuary scheme.

As a result, new guidance has also been published to help councils, the police and other partners make sure that the Sanctuary Schemes they run best meet the needs of domestic violence victims.

Welcoming the research and guidance Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""No one should be driven from their home and left homeless because of a violent family member. This research shows that the effective and practical help Sanctuary Schemes provide can help stop victims of domestic violence becoming victims of homelessness too.
> 
> ""By providing at risk families with the support and safety measures they need, we can help them avoid the upheaval of having to leave their homes and support networks and help them get their lives back on track.
> 
> ""What matters is what works and that's why I'm bringing together Ministers from 8 different Government departments so that we can make sure that in areas such as domestic violence, we're working together across different public services to find the best practical solutions for people.""

The new research has been welcomed by prominent domestic violence organisations Women's Aid and AVA (Against Violence and Abuse).

Chief Executive for Women's Aid, Nicola Harwin CBE, said:

> ""Women's Aid warmly welcomes the findings and recommendations of the research, as we know that Sanctuary Schemes can provide practical protection for survivors of domestic violence who wish to remain in their own homes. However, this needs to be offered together with other options including alternatives such as refuge accommodation and risk assessments need to take place in every case to decide if a Sanctuary Scheme is appropriate and safe.
> 
> ""With two women being killed every week in England and Wales by their partner or ex-partner, it is vital that the safety of the abused woman and any children must remain the absolute priority at all times.""

Director of Against Violence and Abuse, Davina James-Hanman said:

> ""AVA very much welcomes this research which provides us much needed national data on sanctuary schemes. More importantly, we hope the findings will demonstrate to those local authorities that are not currently offering this service that they are missing a trick since the evidence proves that they could provide increased accommodation choices for domestic violence victims whilst also saving money.""

The homelessness prevention statistics published today also show that over the past year councils have successfully stopped over 140,000 households and individuals from becoming homeless. Many of these have been helped to find alternative accommodation, often a privately rented home. In other cases, families were able to stay in their current home thanks to help from their council with rent or mortgage arrears or family mediators.

Homelessness is a key priority for the Coalition Government and the Prime Minister has asked Grant Shapps to bring together Ministers from 8 Government departments to work closely together to look at ways their respective policies and frontline services can tackle the multi-faceted issues that contribute to homelessness.

### Notes to editors

1. The research was carried out by Anwen Jones, Joanne Bretherton, Roger Bowles and Karen Croucher, University of York. The research involved interviews with national stakeholders, local case studies (interviews with service providers, support providers, local stakeholders, and service users), and a cost-benefit analysis.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1705898,Minister hails Bristol as the street party capital,"Communities Minister Andrew Stunell today hailed Bristol the street party capital of England as a host of community events are held throughout the city.

This weekend's street parties will bring the total held in Bristol this year to more than 120, involving over 10,000 people - more than in any year since 1977.

In the past, people trying to organise a small event may have encountered a host of obstacles, including high costs, a multitude of forms and guidelines. Last month Communities Secretary Eric Pickles made it much easier and there is now simple guidance and one straightforward form to fill in.

Mr Stunell said:

> ""The people of Bristol are clearly converts to the positive impact a street party can have on an area giving opportunities to collaborate and increasing the community spirit - not to mention how much fun they are.
> 
> ""Bristol has shown that it's a trailblazer in this area. But there's no reason other cities can't follow Bristol's lead. Street parties don't cost councils anything but can help create the strong communities that benefit everyone.
> 
> ""The guidance and simple form we're encouraging people to use makes it easier than ever for councils and organisers to make parties happen.""

Streets Alive, a group that promotes street parties as a way of engaging with local communities, helped facilitate some of this weekend's events, though residents themselves coordinated and funded them.

Bristol City Council's pioneering efforts to make the process as simple as possible have paid off, with the number of street parties in the city growing each year.

Jon Rogers, Cabinet Member for Care and Health at Bristol City Council, said:

> ""Street parties are an important part of what makes Bristol great. We have cut back on red tape, kept costs down and do all we can to encourage communities to come together in a spirit of celebration. I am not surprised Bristol is leading the country.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1708636,New local enterprise partnerships criss-cross the country,"The commitment and ambition shown by councils and business to radically reshape the way business and government interact at the local level was praised by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles and Business Secretary Vince Cable today.

Following the closing day for submitting local enterprise partnership proposals the Government confirmed that it has received 56 proposals from across the country.

Ministers have been impressed by many of the proposals which are radical in their approach. They identify the variety of challenges facing individual local economies and put forward innovative ways of tackling them - reflecting the importance of allowing local areas to determine their own economic development and drive private sector job growth.

The Government is keen to see partnerships remain proactive and maintain momentum. Over the coming weeks Ministers will consider the proposals in detail, looking at how they will support economic growth, before providing feedback to partnerships ahead of the publication of the White Paper on sub-national economic growth and the introduction of the Localism Bill.

Tackling the debt crisis and rebalancing the economy are urgent national priorities.

Local enterprise partnerships can rewrite the economic geography of the country - unconstrained by arbitrary boundaries of Regional Development Agencies and the top-down prescription approach taken previously. Proposals include partnerships that cut across existing regional boundaries and include universities or community groups among them.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""These 56 local enterprise partnership proposals are just the beginning of a new radical way of delivering prosperity and rebalancing the economy.
> 
> ""We are facing economic problems that need solutions from local communities. The secret to the success of local enterprise partnerships will be working on the basis of local economic geography - gone are the artificial political regions of RDAs - this will better serve the needs of local business.
> 
> ""The bureaucracy of Regional Development Agencies gave local authorities little reason to engage creatively with economic issues. Local enterprise partnerships are a way of tying council and business interests together, and creating the conditions for business to thrive and prosper.""

Vince Cable said:

> ""Business leadership in local enterprise partnerships is critical. Mark Prisk and I have met many leading groups including the CBI, the Institute of Directors, the Federation of Small Businesses, and the British Chambers of Commerce who have all contributed their thoughts to how it should work. It is clear that there must be genuine partnership between business and local government and that local enterprise partnerships should be practical bodies for promoting enterprise, not talking shops.
> 
> ""Trade and investment promotion, sector leadership, innovation, business support and access to finance will in future be led nationally, though with devolved local management in many cases. This still leaves huge scope for local initiatives to promote enterprise. The outcome will vary just as local economic priorities differ across the country. In some areas, there might be a focus on skills. In others, local enterprise partnerships may help set priorities for planning and infrastructure decisions. The key is that these partnerships are built from the bottom-up and will have the flexibility to determine their own agenda, rather than have it handed down to them by Whitehall.""

Yesterday was also the closing date for the consultation on the Regional Growth Fund. Announced in the Budget, the £1bn fund will provide support for projects that offer significant potential for sustainable economic growth and can create new private sector jobs. The two-year fund will particularly help areas that have been traditionally reliant on the public sector make the transition to private sector growth and prosperity. Proposals for funding will be sought from private organisations and public-private partnerships, and local enterprise partnerships will have a key role to play in coordinating bids across areas and communities.

Around 350 responses to the consultation were received, from organisations including trade associations, business groups, local authorities, universities and, environmental bodies, setting out their views on how the Fund can be designed to best meet the needs of local areas and communities. The Government's response to those views and further criteria for funding proposals will be set out in the forthcoming White Paper.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1712792,County flags to fly at Department for Communities and Local Government,"Flags representing the historic counties of England are to be hoisted above the offices of the Department for Communities and Local Government to celebrate their important place in the nation's cultural heritage.

Secretary of State Eric Pickles has asked that English county standards be flown alongside the Union Flag outside the Department's Eland House headquarters in Victoria. Each flag - including the Red Rose of Lancashire and the White Horse of Kent - will fly for a week at a time throughout the year, with the exception of a week when the European Union flag is required to be flown.

Mr Pickles was today invited to raise the first of these flags - his adopted home county of Essex - in a ceremony also attended by celebrity astrologer and long-time English county campaigner Russell Grant.

Following Essex, county flags will be flown in alphabetical order or - in cases such as Cornwall and Yorkshire - to coincide with particular county days.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""The Union Flag rightly has pride of place outside the Department but I'm delighted it will now be flown alongside our traditional and ceremonial county flags.
> 
> ""English counties continue to form an important part of our cultural and local identity in this country and many people remain deeply attached to their home county - both the traditional 'cricket' counties and in some cases their more modern administrative successors. This sense of pride and shared identity is one of the things that binds communities together and it's right that the Government department responsible for communities and local government should be actively recognising the important role they play.""

Celebrity astrologer and long-time English county campaigner and historian Russell Grant said:

> ""Our counties are over a thousand years old and are steeped in history. They give us a sense of identity, of community, and great pride in where we live. I am delighted that they are being recognised in this way.""

Peter Martin, Leader of Essex County Council said:

> ""It is a wonderful honour for the Essex flag to be the first raised at the Department of Communities headquarters. We are extremely proud of our cultural heritage and individual identity in Essex, and promoting strong local communities is one of our top priorities. I am delighted to see that the importance of English counties is being recognised in this way.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1719857,Stunell - Corrupt councillors will go to court not Standards committees,"Serious misconduct for personal gain will be a criminal act, while petty local vendettas will no longer get a hearing as the unpopular standards board regime is axed, Communities Minister Andrew Stunell announced today.

Mr Stunell said the top-down regime set up by central government to monitor council conduct had become a vehicle for malicious and frivolous complaints. For example, one authority had to fork out £160,000 after receiving over 170 complaints from the same person. Each one had to be examined, but only three were considered worth investigating and after investigation all were dismissed.

Local Standards Committees investigated 6000 complaints in the first two years - of which over half were judged not worthy of any further action. The Government is axing the entire Standards regime including the central board, which costs over £6 million a year; with investigations of complaints costing thousands of pounds each.

Genuine corruption in local government needs to be rooted out and the new Government is legislating to make serious misconduct a criminal offence dealt with by the courts not committees. Councillors will have to register certain personal interests in a publicly available register.

Ministers believe these changes will give voters the confidence that councillors who misuse their office will be effectively dealt with. While councillors themselves will have the confidence to get on with their job knowing they won't be plagued by petty allegations.

### Public will decide councillors' fates

Under new plans the public will also have greater confidence to challenge poor local services. The Government intends to give the Local Government Ombudsman, the established body for investigating public complaints over the way they have been treated by their council, reel teeth. For the first time local authorities will be legally compelled to implement the Ombudsman's findings.

Andrew Stunell said:

> ""The Standards Board regime ended up fuelling petty complaints and malicious vendettas. Nearly every council had investigations hanging over them - most of which would be dismissed but not before reputations were damaged and taxpayer money was wasted. Frivolous allegations undermined local democracy and discouraged people from running for public office.
> 
> ""That's why we are axing the unpopular and unelected standards board regime. Instead we will legislate to ensure that if a councillor is corrupt and abuses their office for personal gain they will be dealt with in the criminal courts. If a councillor behaves ineffectively or irresponsibly then it's a matter for the electorate not an unelected quango.
> 
> ""This Government is freeing councillors from central prescription and top down bureaucracy so they can get on with their job. In the future councillors must expect to be judged at the ballot box by an electorate with real access to their accounts and personal interests in a new transparent era.""

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles added:

> ""The standards board regime became the problem, not the solution. Unsubstantiated and petty allegations, often a storm in a teacup, damaged the reputation and standing of local government, as well as wasting taxpayers' money.
> 
> ""But by abolishing the failed standards committees we're not letting councillors off the hook. Failure to register or declare an interest, or deliberately seeking to mislead the public about an interest, will become a criminal offence while a newly empowered Local Government Ombudsman will investigate incompetence on behalf local people.""

The Government will also legislate to make it clear that councillors can campaign and vote freely on their issues. Councillors who have been prevented from speaking on the very issues they had been elected on, such as planning matters, will now have the freedom to express their views.

But councillors will have to register certain personal interests in a publicly available register; this could include anything that could reasonably be regarded as likely to influence or affect their actions, conduct when on business for the authority or voting.

The whole Standards Board regime consisting of a centrally prescribed code of conduct, standards committees with the power to suspend councillors and an unelected central body will be axed in the upcoming Localism Bill.

However councillors will have to conform to the highest standards of conduct. At present if a councillor abuses their position for personal gain it may result in a complaint to the local authority's standards committee with the councillor simply having to apologise. New legislation will make failing to register an interest, or deliberately seeking to mislead the public about an interest a criminal offence.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1719870,Stunell tells councils they can return to the committee system as Whitehall steps out of local affairs,"Councils will be able to run themselves under a system that works best for their area, Communities Minister Andrew Stunell announced today.

The new Government will let councils have a real choice and decide with local people what system is best for their community, whether that be a Mayor or Leader and Cabinet or a Committee system. In 2000 councils across the country were forced to give up committee systems and adopt a new executive model of governance prescribed by central government.

The move to let councils choose is part of the new Government's commitment to a localist approach, that will see Whitehall step back and trust communities to manage themselves.

Andrew Stunell said:

> ""For the last decade councils have been forced to implement a one-size fits all model of Government. This Government will let councils and communities decide how to organise themselves. We don't presume to know more than local people about how their area should be run.
> 
> ""The Coalition Government is committed to localism and pushing power away from Westminster and back to local communities. We're not going to be micromanaging, second guessing and interfering in local affairs anymore.""

Before the Local Government Act 2000, local authorities could either take all decisions in full council or could delegate decision making to committees, sub committees, other local authorities or officers.

The 2000 Act abolished the committee system, and required all local authorities with a population of 85,000 or more to adopt an executive model of governance with an Elected Mayor and Cabinet or Leader and Cabinet.

The new Government will allow councils to return to the committee system, should they wish to.

Mr Clark praised Balsall Heath's Neighbourhood Forum after hearing how local people had reclaimed their streets after being unhappy with the way the area had declined.

The Minister visited the Forum based in what once was once a patch of unkempt council land and is now an award-winning community garden centre. Meeting local residents who grow plants at the centre to place around the community, Mr Clark helped out with preparations for autumn planting.

Residents were told about the Government's new 'barrier busting team' whose sole purpose will be to help community groups like theirs get the backing they need when they encounter bureaucratic obstacles to local objectives.

Greg Clark said:

> ""Local people everywhere know the frustration of watching their town centre decline, their library shut or local crime rising. Here in Balsall Heath a network of local volunteers took the initiative and reclaimed their streets by thinking 'we can do better'.
> 
> ""I was delighted to meet the pioneering residents of Balsall Heath today and see real proof of the value of community participation. With over a thousand members their Neighbourhood Forum really represents local voices who have reshaped their community and made it a better place to live. They are the Big Society in action and other community groups can look to them as a perfect example of people power.
> 
> ""This Government is giving local people more power than ever to shape their neighbourhoods - from taking over the running of parks, libraries and post offices, to more powers to plan and shape housing developments. A new ""barrier-busting"" team will to help community groups like Balsall Heath get the backing they need when they encounter bureaucratic obstacles to their local objectives so volunteering communities can turn their ideas into action.""

Twenty-five years ago Balsall Heath was the centre of city's red-light district. Crime rates were high and the local police station was forced to close to the public, instead operating as a base for the vice squad.

Residents, unhappy with the decline of their local area and lack of services, resolved to work together to reclaim their streets and return a sense of community and pride establishing the neighbourhood forum that is still going strong today.

As crime fell the vice squad is now disbanded and this June residents joined together to reopen and staff the police station's front desk for five days a week and raised the funds to place 15 CCTV cameras in key locations in their community and monitor them from within the police station.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1722128,Grant Shapps: Communities should prepare for their Right to Build,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today announced that local rural housing projects that secure the support of 75 per cent of voters will get the go-ahead without the need for a specific application for planning permission.

This is the next step in bringing forward a Community Right to Build, which will move power from Whitehall to residents to give the green light to new developments that have overwhelming local support and meet minimum planning criteria.

The Minister today urged rural communities to work together to prepare for this new Right to Build, and examine how it can be used to deliver the homes their areas need.

The Government had initially proposed a higher 90 per cent threshold for local Right to Build approval, but it was soon clear that there was a strong preference for a lower threshold across the board.

Mr Shapps believes this new support threshold strikes the right balance - enabling communities to bring forward the development they want while still ensuring that developments are supported by the overwhelming majority of the wider community.

The shift in power through Community Right to Build from Government to communities will be included in the forthcoming Localism Bill, to be introduced later this autumn. It will mean local people can deliver the homes they really want, rather than being told their own expansion doesn't fit in with the local council's plans and therefore cannot go ahead.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""No-one knows the challenges that rural communities face better than the people who live there. I want to give them the power and the freedom to tackle local issues with local solutions through the Community Right to Build, so they can give the go-ahead to the new homes their area needs.
> 
> ""That's why new Community Right to Build organisations will not need to make specific planning applications for new developments. Those plans that get 75 per cent support in local referendums will no longer need to go to the Town Hall for approval - instead, work can begin much more quickly.
> 
> ""I've listened to the views of the public that responded strongly to our consultation, and I believe this threshold strikes the right balance between enabling communities to go ahead with their plans for expansion, while at the same time ensuring the support of the overwhelming majority of the wider community. And I hope it gives rural towns and villages across the country the prompt they need to prepare for a new Right to Build as a solution to the housing challenges they face.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1723670,No council tax revaluation tax rises pledge ministers,"Local taxpayers have been reassured that there will be no unexpected wave of council tax revaluation hikes in the next five years.

Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles and Treasury Minister David Gauke have today confirmed that the Government will not carry out a council tax revaluation in England during the lifetime of this Parliament.

In addition an independent Data Protection Audit of the Valuation Office Agency's (VOA) council tax database is to be carried out to make sure people's privacy is protected when the Agency assesses properties and stores data. This takes forward the Coalition's desire to defend civil liberties, restore the rights of individuals and in keeping with Britain's tradition of freedom and fairness.

There are also plans for a broader local government resource review that will examine the way councils are funded, to provide greater financial freedoms and decrease dependency on Whitehall funding, which has previously pushed up council tax in many local authorities due to so-called 'gearing' effects.

Eric Pickles, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, said:

> ""We are today confirming that there will be no council tax revaluation which could have pushed up taxes on people's homes. The new Government will protect the privacy of law-abiding citizens and halt state inspectors from unnecessary intrusion.
> 
> ""We are standing up for people who have pride in their home, and calling time on the surveillance state.
> 
> ""Hefty council tax bills are a constant financial worry for many people. Today we are setting their minds at ease, and protecting the interests of the less well-off in particular.""

David Gauke, Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, added:

> ""We want fairness in the tax system. Therefore this Government will avoid an unnecessary and expensive revaluation that could lead to increased council tax bills. The Government is committed to being open about its work while protecting the privacy of personal data. To provide assurance on this point, the Valuation Office Agency is commissioning an independent Data Protection Audit of the council tax database.""

### Notes to editors

1. The Coalition Government is committed to undertaking a full review of local government finance. This is due to report in summer 2012.

2. On 23 September the Valuation Office Agency (VOA) published statistics on the numbers of dwellings by Council Tax band and by property attributes, as at 13 September 2010. Data was published for all billing authorities in England and Wales, including national and regional totals.

3. The publication of properties by band is the next release of an ongoing annual series showing the number of properties in each council tax band. This information was previously published by Communities and Local Government. The count of properties with each of the VOA's Property Attribute Codes is newly published as an official statistic. These statistics are published in compliance with the code of practice for official statistics set out in the Statistics and Registration Act 2007.

4. While the VOA aims to be as open and transparent as possible about the data it holds and continually looks for ways to improve the understanding of its work, it takes the protection of personal data extremely seriously. As an Executive Agency of HM Revenue & Customs, the VOA is subject to taxpayer confidentiality laws.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1727284,New rules rein in town hall freesheets and use of lobbyists,"New proposals to stop taxpayers' money being squandered on town hall newspapers or hired lobbyists have been announced by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles today.

In recent years there has been a marked growth in the frequency and scope of council publicity techniques funded by taxpayers' money, whilst local papers have struggled in a saturated news environment.

A consultation published today outlines new proposals to tighten up the publicity rules for councils so they guard against campaigning with public funds. Mr Pickles has previously raised strong concerns over such practices and pledged to rewrite the rule book.

Today's proposals set out specific rules to stop municipal newspapers being published more often than four times a year and to prevent the hiring of lobbyists. Instead, Ministers believe councils should redirect resources into protecting front line services.

The proposals also give more transparency and certainty to local authorities and political parties about exhibition stands at party conferences, for example, by distinguishing between the promotion of a local area for tourism purposes and the taxpayer-funded lobbying of politicians.

Mr Pickles emphasised that he believed the assumption should be that all council publicity would be clearly branded material, issued solely to explain services, and not to influence opinion.

Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, Eric Pickles, said:

> ""An independent local press is an essential part of our open democracy helping local people scrutinise and hold elected councillors to account.
> 
> ""The rules around council publicity have been too weak for too long allowing public money to be spent on wasteful town hall papers that have left many local newspapers looking over the abyss.
> 
> ""The proposals I am publishing today will close off these inappropriate practices and encourage councils to focus taxpayers' money on where it should be spent - protecting frontline services.""

The revised Code of Recommended Practice on Local Authority Publicity includes proposals for seven new central principles that will make sure that council publicity is lawful, cost effective, objective, even handed and appropriate, and that it has regard to equality and diversity and is issued with care during periods of heightened sensitivity.

In particular, the new rules would define 'appropriate use of publicity' in relation to council newspapers and use of lobbyists:

  * Councils should not publish newspapers in direct competition to local press. They should not appear more than quarterly and should only include material directly related to council services.
  * Councils should not spend taxpayers' money to lobby government through private sector lobbyists or through publicity stalls at party conferences.

### Notes to editor

1. Full details of the consultation on the new Government _Code of Recommended Practice on Local Authority Publicity_ can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/publicitycodeconsult2010](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/publicitycodeconsult2010).

2. The Code was originally introduced in 1988 and amended by the last Government in 2001. The purpose of the Code was to ensure proper use of public funds for publicity. Effective, efficient publicity that successfully tells the public what they need to know about the services and activities of their council is legitimate; the public need information to hold their authority to account The Publicity Code is statutory guidance to which local authorities have to have regard in the production of their publicity.The Secretary of State is legally obliged to consult on the revised code.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1728523,Transparency trailblazer Pickles publishes more department spending data,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles is today continuing to open up the Government accounts to the public and set out new austerity procedures for his department.

In the first of regularly planned updates Communities and Local Government has published spend over £500 online for the first quarter of 2010-11 (April-June) - allowing the public to scrutinise how £125m of taxpayer money was spent.

Every central government department will be required to publish data above £25,000 from November to shine a spotlight on spend and root out waste and duplication. Having set the bar at £500 for town halls, Mr Pickles believes his own department should play by those same rules and is acting ahead of deadline to start regularly publishing its figures.

### Future thrift as Department gets house in order

The Secretary of State also revealed new austerity actions, in the form of a series of simple measures, his department is taking to cut waste and bring spending down. These cost saving measures are part of identified £780m savings across the CLG budget for 2010-11.

The money saving ideas, submitted by staff, include:

  * New compliance rules to ensure staff always use public transport and standard class on trains;
  * An end to refreshments for internal staff meetings and any meeting under four hours;
  * Cancellation of non-essential newspaper and magazine subscriptions;
  * A reduction in staff Blackberries and mobile phones;
  * Cutting down on first-class post;
  * Switching off a number of lifts during quiet periods;
  * Plans to limit the number of printers and limiting photocopiers to one per floor;
  * Plans to close CLG's HQ overnight and at weekends; and
  * Turning heating down to save energy and expense.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""Being open about how taxpayers' money is spent will push central and local government into rooting out waste and duplication. That's why we're throwing open the shutters and bringing the full glare of the public's eye onto spending.
> 
> ""This new transparent era means a new way of thinking for councils but I'm showing them it's possible by publishing more of my department's spending online. I can't expect councils to cut waste if we don't get our own house in order. Today I'm implementing the best austerity ideas from CLG staff from cutting catering, to only using second-class stamps to more double-sided printing. These show there are thriftier and smarter ways to use taxpayers' money in the future.
> 
> ""The whole country has to play its part as we tackle a mountain of inherited debt. By publishing this data we invite an army of armchair auditors to scrutinise where their money goes and make sure it is spent on the right priorities. I want town halls to do the same so the public have local spending at their fingertips.""

Departmental spending has also been published today for 2008/09 for over £500 and for spending over £1000 for Arms Length Bodies (ALBs). Last month spending details over £500 for 2009/10 were published.

### Books opened to reveal more Whitehall local spending data

In addition central government departments and ALBs are expanding the data made available relating to expenditure in local areas through a free to use website.

The public can now find datasets on local spending by searching for local-spend-data on government's central data portal data.gov.uk. The data now available for 2007/08 and 2008/09 includes expenditure on benefits, breakdown of revenue expenditure by Primary Care Trusts, Strategic Health Authorities and NHS trusts and grants by Home Office to Drug Action Teams with more datasets available over the coming weeks.

All of the local spending data has been tagged with local-spend-data. The Cabinet Office have announced that anyone can make suggestions about which datasets they wish to see be made public by going to [www.data.gov.uk/data](http://data.gov.uk/home) (external link) and clicking on the 'request new data' button.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1730322,New repossession rules to protect tenants from being booted out without notice,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today welcomed new rules which mean that tenants will no longer live in fear of being booted out of their home with little or no notice.

Before today, if a landlord has not been given consent to let out their property from their lender, and later faces repossession action, the tenants could be left vulnerable since the courts were unable to take account of their circumstances and many were placed in the distressing situation of being given very short notice to find a new place to live.

But new rules, coming into force today, mean that tenants will for the first time be able to attend the court hearing, and judges will be able to take their situation into account and delay repossession by up to two months to give them more time to find a new home.

Guidance published today makes clear the rights these tenants have when their landlord faces repossession action, but also sets out the steps lenders must take. These changes come as part of the Mortgage Repossessions (Protection of Tenants etc) Act 2010.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Of course all landlords should get permission from their lender before renting out their home. But when landlords don't, and they face the real prospect of repossession, their tenants should not be left worse off than any other tenant as a result.
> 
> ""That's why I backed the Mortgage Repossessions Bill last year so tenants can have their voices heard in court, and can get enough time to find a new place to live.
> 
> ""As with all homeowners, I expect lenders to seek repossession only as a last resort. But where action is being taken against a landlord, their tenants must get a fair amount of time to find themselves a new home.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1732284,Grant Shapps outlines plans for new council housing deal,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today committed to giving councils the financial freedom they need to offer a better deal to the four million people living in council housing in England.

Describing the current system of council house financing as ""no longer fit for purpose"", Mr Shapps set out plans to replace it with a new, more transparent system that devolves greater power to councils to better meet the housing needs of their local communities. This delivers a commitment in the Coalition Agreement.

Under the current system, councils are required to pay council house rents and the majority of receipts from any sales of land or homes to Whitehall, who then decide how best to redistribute it back to councils.

But under the proposed new rules, rather than the current Housing Revenue Account subsidy system councils would instead keep all the rents and sales receipts they collect.

In return for this greater freedom, some councils would take on additional housing debt - but no council will take on a level of debt that is not sustainable for the long term.

Details of the new system will be announced as part of the Spending Review on 20 October and will be introduced as part of the Localism Bill being introduced this autumn.

These reforms can only be effectively delivered through a comprehensive and legally binding settlement achieved through primary legislation. The minister is therefore ruling out a voluntary deal ahead of securing the powers in the Localism Bill.

In the period leading up to implementation of the new system, the overall approach for transfer proposals that have yet to be put to a tenant ballot will be a value for money and delivery test against the costs and benefits of the reformed system.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""For far too long councils have been left hamstrung in their efforts to meet the housing needs of their residents by a council house finance system that is outdated and no longer fit for purpose. The Housing Revenue Account subsidy is in urgent need of reform.
> 
> ""That's why I can confirm that we intend to scrap the current system, and instead replace it with something more transparent that will serve the needs of local communities without interference from Whitehall.
> 
> ""Subject to the Comprehensive Spending Review we will offer councils the opportunity to keep the rents they collect and the receipts from any house or land sales. This is a key step to transfer powers to councils and communities, so they are free to improve their local services in a way that best meets the needs of local people.""

To celebrate the important place counties play in the nation's cultural heritage Secretary of State Eric Pickles has asked that English county standards be flown alongside the Union Flag outside the Department's Eland House headquarters in Victoria.

Mr Pickles raised the first flag - for his adopted home county of Essex - in a ceremony also attended earlier this month by celebrity astrologer and long-time English county campaigner Russell Grant.

Flags are being flown for a week at a time in alphabetical order or - in cases such as Cornwall and Yorkshire - to coincide with particular county days.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""The Union Flag rightly has pride of place outside the Department but I'm delighted it will now be flown alongside our traditional and ceremonial county flags.
> 
> ""English counties continue to form an important part of our cultural and local identity in this country and many people remain deeply attached to their home county - both the traditional 'cricket' counties and in some cases their more modern administrative successors. This sense of pride and shared identity is one of the things that binds communities together and it's right that the Government department responsible for communities and local government should be actively recognising the important role they play.""

Mary Bayliss, Lord Lieutenant of Berkshire said:

> ""I am delighted that the flag of our ceremonial county is being flown above the Department this week. I am immensely proud of the county and its constituent parts and our status as the only 'Royal' county in the country.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1737459,Grant Shapps pledge to cut red tape on builders,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today pledged to put the full weight of the new Coalition Government behind cutting red tape and making it easier for developers to get projects started and the homes the country needs built.

He highlighted the steps the Government are already taking to tackle the key obstacles house-builders currently face, and future plans to cut red tape and make it easier and less costly for them to get building work underway.

The Minister pledged to tackle the 'alphabet soup' of standards and red tape that blight efforts to start new developments, and will call on industry leaders to work with Government in a new drive to simplify the system.

This work to cut red tape will complement the ongoing review of building regulations launched by Communities Minister Andrew Stunell earlier this year. 

The review is in addition to a groundbreaking new 'One In, One Out' system which began last month, where Ministers seeking to introduce new regulations that will impose costs on business have to identify current regulations of equivalent value that can be removed.

Mr Shapps also highlighted Government efforts to bring an end to the conflicts of the past between developers and residents with the introduction of a New Homes Bonus, so that those communities going for growth now and in the future will receive direct and substantial extra funding to spend as they wish.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""Last year, housebuilding hit its lowest level for any peacetime year since 1924 as developers have been hampered by regional targets that put them in direct conflict with local communities and an alphabet soup of regulations and red tape they have to navigate.
> 
> ""Today I have a clear message to housebuilders large and small - we are on your side. I am determined to make it easier to build the homes this country needs.  Appropriate building standards, applied sensibly, help developers and communities alike, but they can only be effective if they are easier to understand. That's why I want to simplify the process for housebuilders to meet the standards communities demand.
> 
> ""But I also want to make it easier for these companies to complete new developments where they are wanted. That's why we will introduce powerful new incentives so those communities that give the green light to developments see the benefits of the new homes in their area.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1740305,Tenant Services Authority to be abolished - New powers for tenants to improve social housing,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today announced the abolition of the Tenant Services Authority (TSA), preserving its vital economic regulation functions in a new streamlined Homes and Communities Agency, whilst scrapping tasks considered unnecessary by Ministers - such as excessive data gathering.

The end of the TSA is part of wider Government reforms of public bodies announced today by Minister for the Cabinet Office, Francis Maude. These changes will radically increase the transparency and accountability of public services, and restore political accountability for decisions which affect people's lives and the way taxpayers' money is spent.

Today's move will put local people in real control of driving up the quality of social housing with their landlords, and keep regulation's primary focus on ensuring that lenders have confidence to invest in social housing. It follows a wide-ranging review of the TSA commissioned by Mr Shapps in June - part of the Government's wider agenda of reducing the number and cost of quangos, cutting unnecessary bureaucracy and getting better value for money for the taxpayer.

Under the plans, England's eight million social housing tenants will receive strengthened powers to ensure that their landlords provide quality housing and are held to account when problems arise. Landlords will be expected to support tenant panels - or equivalent bodies - in order to give tenants the opportunity to scrutinise the services being offered and to be involved in resolving disputes.

In a new era of transparency landlords will need to agree with their tenants what information they need about performance so that tenants can effectively scrutinise performance. And there will be a new role for tenants' representatives - local councillors, MPs and tenant panels - in standing up for the rights of tenants and driving up housing standards.

Full details of the review of social housing regulations will be published next week.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""The Tenant Services Authority was set up to oversee the financial viability of social housing and to protect tenants. The Coalition Government is deeply committed to both of these important roles. But in practice the TSA made little difference on the ground with far too many tenants still frustrated by their lack of real power to drive up standards.
> 
> ""That's why I'm putting tenants in the driving seat so they can scrutinise the services offered by their landlords and hold them to account. They will also be key in resolving disputes and local councillors, MPs or tenant panels will have a new role in standing up for tenants and driving up standards. It's about encouraging local solutions to local problems.
> 
> ""But with waiting lists at record levels and a record budget deficit to deal with we need better value for money in the sector so money goes further. The new streamlined regulatory system I am putting in place will focus on this vital objective. Through healthier balance sheets lenders have the confidence to invest in social housing.""

Details of how the Government plans to streamline the Homes and Communities Agency will be announced shortly. Today's announcement will affect 24 Publics Bodies accountable to Communities and Local Government.

### Notes for editors

1. The Tenant Services Authority (TSA) was created by the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008 and is the regulator for nearly 1,800 social housing landlords, including housing associations, councils and co-operatives in England. On 1 April 2010, the TSA commenced regulation with its new powers and based on a common set of standards applicable to social housing landlords.

2. The TSA's budget for 2010-11 is approximately £33 million.

3. Summary of review findings:

  * The Tenant Services Authority (TSA) should be abolished and its economic regulation and backstop consumer regulation functions transferred to the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA), generating efficiency savings in back-office functions and exploiting synergies across investment and regulation.
  * In order to ensure the continued independence of regulation, these functions should be vested in a statutory committee within the HCA, legally separated from HCA's investment functions and with its membership appointed by the Secretary of State.
  * The role of consumer regulation should be refocused on setting clear service standards for social landlords and addressing serious failures against those standards, with a higher legal threshold for regulatory intervention.
  * Greater onus should be placed on local mechanisms to address routine problems and to enable tenants to hold their landlord to account and press for better services. There should be a clearer role in the complaints process for locally elected representatives and tenant panels in advocating for tenants.
  * In order to maintain lender confidence and protect taxpayers, proactive economic regulation of housing associations should continue as now but with more focus on value for money for the taxpayer.

4. 24 Public Bodies accountable to Communities and Local Government will be affected by the proposals in today's announcement. It is proposed that 17 will no longer be public bodies through abolition, devolution, reconstitution or merger (this includes the Audit Commission whose audit functions will be moved to the private sector - details at: [www.communities.gov.uk/news/corporate/1688109](http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/corporate/1688109) ); six will be retained and the future of the Homes and Communities Agency is still under consideration.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1742133,Eric Pickles celebrates British Bangladeshi achievements,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles gave credit to some of the most successful and influential British Bangladeshi people at an awards ceremony in East London on Thursday night.

In his speech to more than 400 members of the British Bangladeshi community, the Secretary of State recognised the many contributions that Bangladeshis have made to British society and beyond. He also emphasised the importance of everyone, from every community, feeling that they can get involved in their local neighbourhood.

The Communities Secretary said:

> ""The Bangladeshi community plays an active role in every sphere of British life and those being awarded tonight are a real inspiration.
> 
> ""As well as the individuals being recognised tonight, Bangladeshi people across the country are more likely than any other ethnic minority group to be involved in local decision-making bodies. In other words, Bangladeshi people are asking, not what their local area can do for them, but what they can do for their local area. Commitment like that - that readiness to get involved - is always to be applauded, and has never been more vital than today.

> ""British Bangladeshis will continue to be an important part of the fabric of this country and it's a pleasure to celebrate today the outstanding achievements of the community"".

The event marked the launch of this year's edition of the British Bangladeshi Who's Who publication. Appearing as Chief Guest at the launch, Mr Pickles spoke alongside Rushanara Ali, the first ever MP of Bangladeshi origin, and the Bangladeshi High Commissioner, Dr M Sayedur Rahman Khan.

The Who's Who lists around 200 successful British Bangladeshis and a small number were picked out to receive awards for their exceptional work. Those receiving awards included Abdul Gaffar Choudhury for his outstanding achievements in journalism and literature and Sir Fazle Hasan Abed for Outstanding International Contribution, for his work in tackling poverty and empowering the poor, especially in Bangladesh.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1745483,Communities Minister urges faith groups to inspire community action,"Communities Minister Andrew Stunell this week encouraged faith based organisations to share their passion and experience with others to maximise their work to help people and improve neighbourhoods.

In a major speech to representatives of groups involved with social action across the country, Mr Stunell stressed that faith based community action is a key plank of the Big Society vision. Faith based organisations are well-rooted in communities and have a long track record of successful work to address social needs. They are also able to stimulate volunteering and financial resources.

Andrew Stunell said:

> ""Faith based organisations have long made an important contribution to local communities, and your work is going to become even more relevant in the months to come. Practical co-operation between churches, mosques, temples, gurdwaras, synagogues and the wider voluntary sector can become a huge force for good in building the stronger communities that are at the heart of the Big Society's purpose.
> 
> ""There are some great examples of faith based providers that are thinking flexibly and reaching out beyond their own natural constituencies, whether of faith or of location. We want more organisations to follow this lead and take advantage of the emerging Big Society to make an even bigger difference in their communities.""

Making the keynote speech at the Faith Based Regeneration Network national conference in London on 19 October, Mr Stunell fleshed out the Government's Big Society plans and challenged those attending to consider how best they can harness the increasing power at the local level in order to address the needs of the neighbourhoods they operate in.

The Minister issued a number of challenges to those at the conference. He asked what Government can learn from faith based organisations and what barriers Government could dismantle that would make it easier for faith based organisations to achieve their goals.

Andrew Stunell updated delegates on work that's already taking place to foster the Big Society, including in the four 'vanguard areas'. These four places are receiving targeted Government support to help resolve the bureaucratic barriers that get in the way of locally driven community development.

The Minister went on to say that organisations and projects that bring people with different beliefs together are especially important in helping to build a stronger, more integrated society. Inter Faith Week next month will be an opportunity to celebrate and encourage inter faith dialogue and social action.

### Notes to editors

1. The Faith Based Regeneration Network (FbRN) describes itself as 'the leading multi faith network for community development, community regeneration and social action'. Connecting with 9,000 faith based organisations and practitioners of social and community action, it spans all faith traditions and has Trustees from the nine main faiths in the UK. It aims to build the skills and capacity for faith based social action, and to connect communities with policy makers.

2. Inter Faith Week is being led by the Inter Faith Network. The aims of Inter Faith Week are:

  * to strengthen good inter faith relations at all levels

  * to increase awareness of the different faith communities in the UK, in particular celebrating and building on the contribution that their members make to their neighbourhoods and to wider society

  * to increase understanding between people of religious and non-religious belief.

Inter Faith Week 2010 will run from 21-27 November in England and Wales. For more information go to [www.interfaithweek.org](http://www.interfaithweek.org.uk) (external link).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1748116,16 areas get 'Community Budgets' to help the vulnerable,"Sixteen areas were today given direct control over local spending in their area free of centrally imposed conditions as part of the Spending Review.

From April next year this first phase of 16 areas covering 28 councils and their partners will be put in charge of 'Community Budgets' that pool various strands of Whitehall funding into a single 'local bank account' for tackling social problems around families with complex needs.

Ministers are determined to give communities more power to target spending on key local priorities, despite the reductions in spending. Communities will be able to hold their councils to account in making sure tighter funding gets spent better.

Around £8 billion a year is spent on around 120,000 families that have multiple problems, with funding only getting to local areas via hundreds of separate schemes and agencies. Despite this investment, these families' problems continue. Services need to join up and intervene earlier so that families are given the chance to turn their lives around. This integrated, early intervention approach will also drive down costs.

Community Budgets, which the Government intends to roll out nationally by 2013-14, will put councils and their partners in the driving seat by pooling funds for tackling these families' needs into one budget so communities can develop local solutions to local problems.

Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Eric Pickles said:

> ""Until now councils have never had the freedom to do things their own way. Whitehall funding has been funneled through hundreds of disparate funding programmes wrapped up in tight financial conditions that effectively strangled local choice. As a result the incentive to be innovative, efficient and responsive to voters instead of Whitehall was dramatically dulled.
> 
> ""By uprooting the silos, unlocking and relinquishing the spending controls administered by Whitehall we can give towns and places the freedom to direct spending to best meets the needs of the citizens within their boundaries.
> 
> ""We have already freed up billions of pounds of council funding but we're determined to do more to put councils in the spending driving seat. As part of the spending review, we've torn down those artificial barriers so that the funding for families with complex needs reaches areas as a single pot of money - a Community Budget - that will help better protect frontline services and help the most vulnerable.""

Already the Government will be freeing up a further £7 billion of council funding from red tape and bureaucracy from 2011-12, but Ministers believe even more can be achieved with Community Budgets. By having one budget wrapping money and services around the needs of the vulnerable, councils and partners will be able to directly support those that need help with education, health, anti-social behaviour and housing - instead of maintaining the service organisations.

Ministers believe Community Budgets will also help drive down overhead costs by removing the bureaucratic financial restrictions that have created barriers, generated waste and duplication in public spending stifling local innovation. They will be able to redesign and integrate frontline services across organisations and share management functions to reduce running costs for the best local outcomes.

The Government believes all 16 areas have demonstrated that they have strong local relationships involving communities, voluntary sector and public sector players which put them in a strong position to operate the first Community Budgets from 2011-12. They are:

  * Birmingham

  * Blackburn with Darwen

  * Blackpool

  * Bradford

  * Essex

  * Greater Manchester (a group of 10 councils)

  * Hull

  * Kent

  * Leicestershire

  * Lincolnshire

  * London Borough of Barnet

  * London Borough of Croydon

  * London Borough of Islington

  * London Borough of Lewisham

  * The London Boroughs of Westminster, Hammersmith and Fulham, Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and Wandsworth

  * Swindon

### Notes to editors

1. This is just the beginning, the Government expects Community Budgets to be available for those places with elected city mayors and from April 2013 we intend to make Community Budgets available to all places.

2. Central Government departments will also be actively working with a further 20 innovative areas to help push forward local flexibility and to address barriers. For example, DCLG and Cabinet Office will be working together to support budgets focussed at the very local level in 13 areas, including Birmingham, Bristol, Newcastle, and Stoke. Cabinet Office will work with Cheshire West and Chester, Kingston-upon-Thames, Blackburn, Barnsley, Calderdale, Sheffield, Leeds, Tameside, Warrington to involve communities in designing and commissioning services that better meet local needs. Places that want to trial different ways of delivering services including community-designed and delivered services are encouraged to do so.

3. In taking this work forward, the Department will be working alongside the national champion, announced in the Spending Review, who will be driving forward a national campaign to support and help turn around the lives of families with multiple problems.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1766293,Grant Shapps: New common sense code to build greener homes,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today published an improved green rating for new homes that will help deliver the next generation of green properties, which are built to the highest standards of sustainable design, and could reduce future utility bills by up to £2,250 a year in the most energy efficient homes.

The Code for Sustainable Homes was introduced in April 2007 as a standard to improve the overall sustainability of new homes. The Code scores against a star rating system, using one to six stars depending on how the property performs against categories such as energy use, waste, materials and water.

Mr Shapps said the Code has been updated to take into account the tougher new rules for energy efficiency in buildings, and help developers make new homes greener without getting bogged down in unnecessary 'gold plated' design features.

The Code, which has been updated after an extensive consultation with housebuilders and industry experts, will also make it easier for consumers and homeowners who want to grade the standard of their properties.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""Over a quarter of the country's carbon emissions come from our homes, and if we're serious about tackling climate change we need to reduce this. So I welcome these changes to the Code that bring it in line with the tough new rules for energy efficiency in the Building Regulations.
> 
> ""We need greener homes, but I also want to make it easier to build the homes this country needs. Good building standards can only be effective if they are easy to understand, and only applied where they are appropriate. That's why the Code has been updated to iron out problems that have arisen over time, and streamlined so building standards can be used in a sensible way that suits the local situation.
> 
> ""It's important house builders meet the standards local communities demand, but I'm determined to simplify the complicated processes they have to go through to achieve this. That's why I've pledged to tackle the 'alphabet soup' of standards and red tape that blight efforts to start new developments, and I will be working with industry to get this done.""

The Code is rated from one to six, one being the entry level - above the level of the standard, mandatory Building Regulations - and six as highest, reflecting outstanding sustainable development.

In the first three years, nearly 8,000 homes have been completed to Code level standards. Ministers believe this figure is too low, partly because the current Code is too complicated and bureaucratic. The updated version will be a first step towards making it is easier for developers to deliver more green homes. The new Code's green rating system has been improved by:

  * **Aligning the Code with the latest developments in building regulations** - it will now take into account, and in some cases go beyond, the tougher new Building Regulations to reduce carbon emissions from buildings. For example, a Code level 4 home will now be 25 per cent above this minimum standard. The new Code will also strongly incentivise the introduction of 'fabric energy efficiency standards', so developers can use building materials and techniques that improve the energy efficiency of new homes.

  * **Streamlining the Code and associated processes** - to ensure that the Code is focused on the issues of greatest significance, instead of including unnecessary standards that duplicate existing regulations or create difficulties for developers. For example, there is now an exemption from the 'lifetime homes' standards for sites where it is too steep to apply, and the mandatory requirement for site waste management plans has been removed since it is required by other regulations.

  * **Resolving problems that have arisen in use of the Code** - for example, clarifying parts of the Code that set standards for reducing the risk of flooding. Clear surface water management standards have now been set, enabling developers to understand exactly what is required.

The new Code will have key role in helping people cut their carbon emissions and lead more sustainable lifestyles. The standards reflect the future goals for zero carbon homes and include measures for reducing energy consumption, minimising and recycling waste, reducing potable water demand, reducing the risk and impact of flooding, reducing carbon intensive travel by providing cycle storage as well as promoting facilities for working at home. It encourages a reduction in energy through the choice of building materials as well as the energy used during the construction.

### Notes to editors

1. The Code is a voluntary standard with flexibility for developers to determine the most cost-effective mix of issues to cover to achieve any particular level, subject to a limited number of mandatory requirements to secure particular Code levels. However, it is also used as a condition by local authorities when they want to set sustainability-based planning conditions on housing developments in their area. However, before setting such a condition, planning guidance (PPS1 Supplementary Guide) currently requires authorities to undertake a full viability assessment setting out the costs to industry, and the benefits. The new Code and technical guide can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/codeguidesummary2010.](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/codeguidesummary2010)

2. Compared to the current version of the Code, the changes being introduced today could result in an overall net present value benefit to the UK economy of nearly £110m. Full details are available in the Impact Assessment which is also being published today at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/codeimpactassessment2010.](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/codeimpactassessment2010)

3. A major potential saving for developers has been made by making requirements over rainwater management more sensitive, which was proposed by many developers. This, in conjunction with other measures, could reduce the cost of constructing Code homes by up to £50m, depending on the location.

4. Average savings for householders on utility bills are set out below. In 2010, taking into account feed in tariffs, households built to Code level 6 could save between £1250 for a flat and up to £2250 for a detached house in energy and water bills.

Annual Fuel bill and feed-in tariff revenue relative to a Part L compliant home in 2010  
  
  
  


5. Practical experience of working with the Code is also informing the development of other aspects of sustainability policy. For example the development of surface water management proposals in the current Floods and Water Management Bill.

6. The Government is committed to reduce the burden of regulation, and to reducing duplication. Future plans to review the future role of the Code are currently being considered, alongside a wider rationalisation of housing standards.

7. The rating standards in the Code are assessed against nine categories:

  * Pollution
  * Heath and Wellbeing
  * Management
  * Ecology
  * Energy and CO2 Emissions
  * Water
  * Materials
  * Surface Water Run-off
  * Waste

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1768095,Cumbria floods remembered at Department for Communities and Local Government,"The Department for Communities and Local Government has joined the people of Cumbria in remembering the floods that hit the county last year by flying the county flag above its offices in Central London.

Hundreds of homes and businesses in several communities across the county were hit by the floods in November 2009. The 12 months since have been a time of rebuilding for Cumbria's residents and a strong sense of community spirit has prevailed.

Counties such as Cumbria play an important part in the nation's cultural heritage, and in recognition of this Secretary of State Eric Pickles has asked that English county standards be flown alongside the Union Flag outside the Department's Eland House headquarters in Victoria.

Mr Pickles raised the first flag - for his adopted home county of Essex - in a ceremony earlier this year. Flags are being flown for a week at a time in alphabetical order, to coincide with particular county days, or in Cumbria's case to mark significant calendar dates.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""England's counties continue to form an important part of our cultural and local identity in this country and many people remain deeply attached to their home county. It is fitting that this week's flag is Cumbria - whose communities showed such great resilience during last year's devastating floods. This sense of pride people have in where they live and a shared identity is one of the things that binds communities together and it's right that the Government department responsible for communities and local government should be actively recognising the important role they play.""

Cllr Eddie Martin, Leader of Cumbria County Council, said:

> ""Cumbria has forged a strong identity in its relatively brief 36-year history as a county. We've built a brand as a welcoming place of great beauty, where we have strong traditional values, a sense of pride in where we live, and are always willing to help one another out. Our strong sense of community has come to the fore in the last 12 months, when we have not only faced the worst floods on record, but have also seen the tragedy of the Derrick Bird shootings and the Keswick school bus crash. We are delighted that Cumbria's flag will be flying outside the Department for Communities and Local Government on this significant anniversary.""

### Notes to editors

The Department is obliged to fly the European Union flag during Europe Week (w/c 9 May) under Article 7(2) of EC Regulation 1828/2006.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1772397,DCLG begins top-level streamlining with two key appointments,"The Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) has announced key appointments to its new top structure, marking the first substantive moves to streamline the senior leadership of the organisation.

The two Directors General who will head the Department's new Localism and Neighbourhoods policy groups have today been named as David Prout and Richard McCarthy, who each already serve at this grade in DCLG.

Last week, Irene Lucas, Director-General for Local Government and Regeneration, announced her departure in March 2011 to pursue business interests.

A second Director General in the Department has announced his intention to leave the Civil Service. Joe Montgomery, currently Director General for Regions and Communities, will leave at the end of January 2011, to pursue a range of business interests in the field of sustainable urban development.

Because of these decisions, the two new appointments were made by the Permanent Secretary, Sir Bob Kerslake, without the need for a competition.

David Prout, currently Director General for Communities, will take on the new Localism group which includes Local Government, Fire, Communities and the Big Society. Richard McCarthy, currently Director General for Housing and Planning, will lead the Neighbourhoods group which includes both these policy areas and regeneration.

Joe Montgomery has been Director General since 2001, most recently leading on Thames Gateway, Olympics and the Government Office Network. Until his departure he will continue to lead the programme to close down the Government Offices, which DCLG is managing on behalf of all departments.

Joe Montgomery said:

> ""I am excited by DCLG's new agenda of localism, decentralisation and the Big Society. I feel, however, that it is time for me to make my own contribution to public service and the Big Society in new ways.
> 
> ""I continue to be a believer in all that DCLG stands for, and I have cherished the opportunity to play a meaningful and fulfilling role in the Civil Service over the last nine years.
> 
> ""I now look forward to new and stretching opportunities to address the challenge of delivering sustainable development in our towns and cities.""

Sir Bob Kerslake said:

> ""I have worked with Joe in different capacities for well over ten years. He has brought an immense amount of wisdom, skill and humanity to whatever he has done in the job and I wish him well in whatever he decides to do next.""

A third Director General role in the new top structure - with responsibility for Finance and Corporate Services - has not yet been filled, but recruitment to the post is expected to take place shortly.

A selection process is currently underway which will reduce the number of DCLG staff at the next most senior grade, Director, from 21 to 15. Confirmation of these appointments is expected before Christmas.

In the New Year, the Department's work and staff will re-group under the newly appointed Directors and Directors General.

Sir Bob Kerslake told staff on 22 October that up to 40 per cent of jobs in the Department might go. Under the Spending Review, administrative budgets for DCLG are to be cut by 33 per cent over the four years to 2014-15.

### Notes to editors

Joe Montgomery has been a Director General since joining the Department for Transport Local Government and the Regions to lead the National Strategy for Neighbourhood Renewal in March 2001. Since then he has held lead responsibility for the Thames Gateway programme, the Government Offices and establishing the Department's role in supporting the work of regional ministers.

Before joining the Department, Joe was Executive Director for Regeneration at Lewisham Council in London. He has extensive experience of urban renewal from his work as Assistant Secretary to the Cadbury Trust; as Leader of the Government's Inner City Task Force (in Deptford); and as Chief Executive of one of the 'pathfinder' City Challenge urban regeneration companies.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1779907,Shapps: We're lifting burdens from the backs of builders,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today announced he is scrapping new proposals that could have cost developers thousands of pounds extra to build new homes, and pledged an overhaul of the complicated building standards that make it hard for developers to complete their projects.

The Government will not introduce a new set of building standards that were proposed for many of the homes built with Government funding or on public sector land, which would have cost developers an extra £8,000 for every home.

Ministers believe that the national building standards are sufficient to deliver high quality homes, and it is an unfair and unnecessary expense for developers to require additional building standards for public build, at a time when the country desperately needs to build more homes.

Mr Shapps also pledged to end the 'alphabet soup' of local building standards and red tape that blight efforts to get developments started, and sweep away the bureaucratic assessment regimes that accompany them. He invited the industry to come forward and help develop a new system for local standards so new development meets the needs of local communities, without placing an unnecessary strain on developers.

Currently housebuilders face a complex mix of building standards and codes that are attached to planning permissions. Ministers believe these extra requirements are often unnecessary 'gold plating', which can be contradictory and place additional costs on developers, making their projects less viable.

In their place, housebuilders and councils will work together to develop a simple and transparent 'menu' of costed standards that will not place unrealistic burdens on developers. Today's move is designed to make it easier for companies to build new developments where they are wanted, and follows the Government's pledge to match the council tax raised from new homes for the first six years through the New Homes Bonus. Councils that go for growth will build up rewards for their local area, and there will be a higher level of funding for building new affordable homes.

Speaking to the National House Building Council, Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Today is the first step of many towards reducing the unnecessary cost and hassle that the people who build our homes are forced to endure. Last year, housebuilding slumped to the lowest level in peacetime since 1924. We were in the midst of a recession, but the situation was made much worse by regional targets that forced developers into direct conflict with local communities, and compounded by the alphabet soup of regulations and red tape that housebuilders have to navigate.
> 
> ""We are on the side of families who want more good quality homes available - that's why we're scrapping expensive new standards for homes built with Government cash and on public land. There's no good reason why homes built on public land should be built any differently to those of high quality on private land. So I'm getting rid of this unnecessary requirement, and I'll be working hard to make sure that, in the long run, the standards that apply to private and public housing are exactly the same.
> 
> ""I'm also calling time on the cocktail of local building standards that developers have to meet, some of which are directly contradictory. House builders are the experts at building homes, so I'm inviting them to be in charge of developing a new framework for local building standards - one which enables communities to get the high quality homes they demand, but without causing unnecessary costs and delays for developers.""

House Builders Federation Executive Chairman Stewart Basely said:

> ""Having campaigned for a reduction in the 'regulatory burden on new homes' for many years it's great that the Government has recognised the impact the cost of excessive regulation has on the supply of the homes the country desperately needs. We look forward to working with local and national government to create a simpler, less costly system which will go a long way to helping solve our housing crisis.""

National House Building Council Chief Executive Imtiaz Farookhi said:

> ""I'm delighted that the Minister has chosen to announce details of this critical policy area at our annual lunch later today and welcome the invitation to play a central role in developing the policy process. We look forward to making a positive contribution working with government and others to deliver a successful policy for the industry and new home owners.""

Proposals for new Core Standards for development funded or on land owned by the Homes and Communities Agency, which could on average have cost developers an additional £8,000 per home, will not be implemented. In the meantime, to provide stability and protect delivery, the HCA will continue to use existing standards, but Mr Shapps confirmed in the longer term, the standards that apply to private and public housing should be the same. As a start to this process, all centrally-imposed standards for houses built on surplus central government land will be removed, in a move expected to provide a boost to home builders.

From today, work will begin on a new Local Standards Framework that will be developed and maintained by industry and councils. The Government will help its development, but industry and councils will develop the ideas themselves, to ensure the options proposed meet the needs of local communities, and don't impose unrealistic burdens on developers. The new local framework will be implemented through the National Planning Policy Framework, which will be introduced by April 2012.

Mr Shapps also confirmed that the recent review of Building Regulations will be published shortly, and will keep the regulations as the mechanism to set national minimum standards. Starting today, there will be an opportunity for developers to make suggestions for further deregulation of the industry.

The Government made a commitment in the Spending Review to reduce the overall regulatory burden on the house-building industry by March 2015, and today's announcement is an important step towards this.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1786564,New national 'address book' to be free to emergency services,"A single 'address book' for England and Wales is to be created and made free to the emergency services for the first time, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles announced today.

For years business and essential services have had to pay for the two different national address lists maintained by councils and Ordnance Survey creating a costly and inefficient system.

An agreement has been reached to set up a joint venture between Ordnance Survey and the Local Government Group to create a new single source of address data.

The new National Address Gazetteer will be free to all public services including the emergency services that rely on it to get to people in distress quickly. Essential services currently need both sets of address lists to ensure they have a comprehensive list of addresses available. It is also vital for managing benefits, arranging school buses, refuse collection routes and registering to vote.

Businesses will benefit from now only having to get one license for the addresses instead of two. This information is vital for many private sector businesses, such as utility companies or insurance firms who use address data to respond to incidents and help them fix problems quicker.

Eric Pickles, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government said:

> ""It's crazy we don't have one single address list in this country. It makes no sense that both the public sector and businesses have to bear the unnecessary expense of licensing two sets of data, especially in these straiten times.
> 
> ""In particular, it is vital that the emergency services can get to people as quickly as possible. Having only one 'address book' will make that job easier, deliver vital savings that can be put towards frontline services and bring real benefits for business.""

Having just one database will cut out the time and money needed to produce and maintain two separate registers and bring savings that can be used for frontline services. This will provide:

  * greater efficiency by removing duplication and inefficient processes, such as the time needed to match addresses and work between two different databases

  * better delivery by being a simpler, easier product for both the public sector and businesses

  * greater transparency and make all addressing information free at the point of use for the entire public sector including those organisations working on behalf of the public sector.

Baroness Margaret Eaton, chairman of the Local Government Association, said:

> ""We are delighted to be working with Ordnance Survey to bring together, for the first time, this important information. This landmark agreement will allow councils and other public sector organisations to build a better, more accurate picture of where people live to help them deliver the services people need in a way that they want.""

Sir Rob Margetts CBE, Ordnance Survey non-executive chair, commented:

> ""I am enthusiastic about the creation of a single national address gazetteer and very confident that it will bring new benefits to all users of address information. Much hard work has gone into creating this joint venture which will supply a definitive source of accurate spatial address data to both the private and public sectors. I would like to thank everyone involved for getting the project this stage.
> 
> ""Over the last nine months Ordnance Survey has achieved some major milestones with the launch of OS OpenData in April, the Public Sector Mapping Agreement in August and now the announcement of a single national address gazetteer database. The demand for accurate, accessible, high quality geographic information has never been so high and the products which will be created from the new national address gazetteer database will be another step in meeting the needs of all of our customers.""

### Notes to editors

1. Local Government Group and Ordnance Survey are working together to create a single national address gazetteer database to combine the best of local government's address data (the National Land and Property Gazetteer) with Ordnance Survey's flagship address product (OS MasterMap Address Layer 2).

2. Access to addresses in the Gazetteer will be free at the point of use for the entire public sector including organisations delivering services on behalf of the public sector, as part of the Public Sector Mapping Agreement.

3. The joint venture will be responsible for the production and maintenance of the National Address Gazetteer database.

4. It is anticipated the database will be developed by April 2011. This will allow the market to review the database before it is released.

5. The proposal for the National Address Gazetteer will be referred to the Office of Fair Trading for third parties to comment.

6. Local Government in Scotland and the Scottish Government are supportive of creating a national address gazetteer and are working with Local Government and Ordnance Survey on ways to achieve this.

7. ONS are working with the Local Government Group and Ordnance Survey to share their knowledge gained from preparing the 2011 Census.

8. The national address gazetteer is welcomed by Royal Mail. Their 28 million addresses and 1.8 million postcodes in the Postcode Address File (PAF) will form a key component of the national address gazetteer database.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1788479,Gloucestershire flag flying at Department for Communities and Local Government,"The flag representing the historic county of Gloucestershire has been hoisted above the offices of the Department for Communities and Local Government.

To celebrate the important place counties play in the nation's cultural heritage Secretary of State Eric Pickles has asked that English county standards be flown alongside the Union Flag outside the Department's Eland House headquarters in Victoria.

Mr Pickles raised the first flag - for his adopted home county of Essex - in a ceremony also attended earlier this year by celebrity astrologer and long-time English county campaigner Russell Grant.

Flags are being flown for a week at a time in alphabetical order or - in cases such as Cornwall and Yorkshire - to coincide with particular county days.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""The Union Flag rightly has pride of place outside the Department but I'm delighted it will now be flown alongside our traditional and ceremonial county flags.
> 
> ""England's counties continue to form an important part of our cultural and local identity in this country and many people remain deeply attached to their home county - both the traditional 'cricket' counties and in some cases their more modern administrative successors. This sense of pride and shared identity is one of the things that binds communities together and it's right that the Government department responsible for communities and local government should be actively recognising the important role they play.""

Dame Janet Trotter DBE, Lord-Lieutenant of Gloucestershire said:

> ""Gloucestershire Cathedral; the beauty of the Forest of Dean; the excitement of the Cheltenham National Hunt Festival; the wooded slopes of the Cotswolds and the serenity of Tewkesbury Abbey are among aspects of the historic county of Gloucestershire of which we are proud.
> 
> ""The county has a 1000 year history but a lively modern economy which has many award winning industries and businesses. Today we value our diverse local communities and our commitment to supporting one another whatever the need: this was particularly demonstrated during the 2007 floods when we demonstrated a community spirit which continues to this day.""

### Notes to editors

1. The Department is obliged to fly the European Union flag during Europe Week (w/c 9 May) under Article 7(2) of EC Regulation 1828/2006.

2. The Gloucestershire flag has been kindly loaned by the Association of British Counties at no charge.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1788714,Planning power from Town Hall and Whitehall to local people,"Neighbourhoods will be the 'building blocks of the Big Society'

Radical new planning reforms were announced today to hand powers down from Whitehall bureaucrats and down from Town Hall officials to communities so local people shape the character of the very neighbourhood in which they live.

In what are being labelled the building blocks of the Big Society, bold changes are being revealed to galvanise local democracy and help build new homes and plan new development with local support, and reward - not punish - those who want to grow and enhance their neighbourhood.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles and Planning Minister Greg Clark today outlined proposals to decentralise and streamline the planning system, ahead of the publication of the Localism Bill.

  * **Neighbourhood groups to shape where they live**: Communities will be able to come together to decide what their area should look like, where new shops, offices or homes should go and what green spaces should be protected. Parish councils and new neighbourhood forums of local people - rather than town hall officials - will lead the way in shaping their community. If local people then vote in favour of new 'Neighbourhood Plans' in local referendums, councils will have to adopt them.
  * **Direct democracy**: This new stimulus will be one of the greatest incentives to get people and communities to come together to take control of planning. The new powers will also allow communities to give planning approval to chosen sites on local land. This will mean that urgent development can go ahead quickly once the plan is adopted, short-circuiting lengthy planning applications and making the system more democratic and efficient.
  * **Local benefits from local development**: At the heart of the new approach will be a package of powerful incentives, such as the New Homes Bonus, that will encourage the right kind of local development and financially reward those councils and communities that deliver new homes and businesses to their area. Reforms to the Community Infrastructure Levy will also see a meaningful proportion of the levy handed over to the local neighbourhoods where the development takes place.
  * **Vanguards to lead the way**: Ministers are calling on communities to get involved now. The Government would like to see about a dozen local areas come forward to act as vanguards that will trial Neighbourhood Plans in their area. This step will help ensure the experience of these 'Neighbourhood Vanguards' is taken into account before the legislation comes into force.

Eric Pickles, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, said:

> ""For far too long local people have had too little say over a planning system that has imposed bureaucratic decisions by distant officials in Whitehall and the town hall. We need to change things so there is more people-planning and less politician-planning, so there is more direct democracy and less bureaucracy in the system. These reforms will become the building blocks of the Big Society.""

Greg Clark, Minister for Planning and Decentralisation, added:

> ""Most people love where they live, yet the planning system has given them almost no say on how their neighbourhood develops. The Coalition Government will revolutionise the planning process by taking power away from officials and putting it into the hands of those who know most about their neighbourhood - local people themselves. This will be a huge opportunity for communities to exercise genuine influence over what their home town should look like in the future. It will create the freedom and the incentives for those places that want to grow, to do so, and to reap the benefits. It's a reason to say yes.""

Tony Burton, Director of Civic Voice, said:

> ""Local communities care deeply about where they live and know it better than anyone. Neighbourhood plans will allow civic societies and other community groups to take the lead in setting out what people value, what development is needed and what can change for the better in their area. With the right support, and safeguards to ensure the community voice cannot be ignored, a new era of neighbourhood plans spreading rapidly across the country could transform the ability of people to shape their local area.""

### Notes to editors

#### Vanguards

1. Councils for Eden in Cumbria, Sutton in Surrey, West Dorset District Council, Bristol and the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead have already shown an interest in working with their communities. Ministers will consider proposals to become Neighbourhood Vanguards as they come forward.

#### Neighbourhood planning

2. As well as streamlining existing processes, the Government will introduce a new right for communities to shape their local areas by creating neighbourhood plans, and introduce powerful new incentives to encourage local communities to approve sustainable development. The new neighbourhood plans will be flexible so communities will be able to determine the issues or areas to cover and what level of detail they want to go into. Importantly it will enable communities (through a new Neighbourhood Development Order) to define specific developments or types of development which will have automatic planning permission without the need for any application to the local authority. For more complex cases they will be able to grant outline permission so that the right to develop would be established and only the details would need to be approved. This provides certainty which is vital for investment and giving communities confidence in the system. Neighbourhoods can also establish general policies that will steer decisions on traditional planning applications.

#### Defining neighbourhoods

3. Communities will be able to propose the boundaries of their neighbourhood. Neighbourhoods will generally be based on existing parishes and towns but the local council will have a role in mediating and consulting where there are conflicts or no established boundaries. This will provide a stable basis for neighbourhood planning, with local authorities approving appropriate boundaries.

#### Process for developing neighbourhood plans

4. Plans will be taken forward by Parishes or 'Neighbourhood Forums' in places without Parishes. The local council would have a duty to provide support and to ensure compliance with other legal requirements. There will be a light touch examination of the plan by an independent assessor to ensure that it complies with legal requirements and national policy, and is aligned with neighbouring plans and the strategic elements of the council's plan. A referendum (with a simple majority in favour) would ensure that the final plan had public support.

Neighbourhood plans must work inside some limits. It will not be a means for saying no to important growth. If major infrastructure is needed at a national level, such as a high-speed rail line, or if the strategic local plan calls for a certain number of homes to be built. They would still be required to be consistent with national planning policy and to conform to the strategic elements of local authority plans. The Localism Bill will have safeguards to ensure neighbourhood plans do not override these wider ranging plans. The National Planning Policy Framework will be vital in this respect.

#### Adoption

5. The council will have a duty to adopt a legally compliant neighbourhood plan that had been successfully passed by a referendum, giving real power to communities to determine if the plan is acceptable.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1789263,Eric Pickles praises Big Society snow angels and gritty determination from communities,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has praised people's efforts and neighbourly support in the cold weather this week and applauded the Big Society spirit from local councils and communities.

In guidance issued today, Mr Pickles also called on councils and other local organisations to avoid icy bureaucracy getting in the way of community action, and reminded people that they would not be subject to legal action under health and safety laws if they used common sense to clear a pavement or help grit a path.

During the recent cold spell, major disruption has been caused and conditions have been tough but hundreds of people and organisations have swung into action to help others through kind support.

Eric Pickles, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, said:

> ""There should be no barriers getting in the way of community action. I want to send out a strong message that clearing a path and helping your neighbours should no longer be subject to icy bureaucracy and health and safety zealotry. Common sense is now the order of the day.
> 
> ""In this cold snap, the values of the Big Society are more important than ever. Thousands of people have stepped up for their community. Parents swept the paths so that children could get to school safely. Volunteers in mountain rescue teams worked round the clock to help the stranded. People checked in on elderly neighbours, did their shopping or visited the library for them. We should celebrate that community spirit.""

### Notes to editors

1. DCLG has today reissued guidance that challenges misconceptions about health and safety laws getting in the way of action and volunteering. It also contains contacts for useful charities such as the Red Cross for vulnerable people, and tips on how to volunteer [http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/communities/severeweatherguidance](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/communities/severeweatherguidance).

2. Local initiatives such as free shovel schemes in Camden are proving a success, where neighbours are encouraged to pass the shovel on next door once they have finished clearing their driveway.

3. The London Borough of Sutton, also a Big Society vanguard, is giving away free bags of grit for local people. So far, thousands of people have taken up the offer and helped clear the way with council workers, keeping paths clear so help can reach the most vulnerable people and shops can stay open.

4. Durham County Council have enlisted the support of farmers who hold winter maintenance contracts to help clear other areas and have redeployed staff from certain normal duties to help clear snow from pavements in high priority areas.

5. In Newcastle, the Council has produced tips for driving in hazardous conditions created by snow and ice. Examples of these include: carrying a car kit in your vehicle, which contains waterproof clothes, a torch and spade, mobile phone charger and emergency contact list for instance; telling family and friends about your travel plans; making sure your car has adequate visibility by clearing front and back windscreens and all windows/wing mirrors before setting off; and checking on older friends and neighbours, making sure they are warm and safe. To avoid doubt, the Council has also made clear that residents are entitled to clear the snow from their own driveways.

More generally, the Council's actions in the face of current weather conditions are part of its vision for a 'Resilient Newcastle'. This vision includes plans for sustaining communities during major incidents, as well as encouraging local businesses and voluntary agencies to prepare to continue operating during times of crisis or recover effectively following disruption.

6. A community in Nenthead in Cumbria have clubbed together and bought and are now running a snowplough, with the assistance of Cumbria County Council.

7. HMRC have also issued guidance clarifying that any vehicle being used to clear snow from public roads by means of a snow plough or similar device is entitled to use red diesel. The law in relation to gritting is that in order to be entitled to use red diesel the vehicle has to be constructed or adapted solely for the conveyance of machinery for spreading material on roads to deal with frost and snow. HMRC recognise the vital role played by farmers in helping to keep rural roads clear. They will exercise an element of discretion, taking into account the exceptionally severe weather.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1789727,Grant Shapps: Councillors being given more powers than ever to become local champions,"Local Government Minister Grant Shapps today outlined how radical new legislation will make councillors more powerful than ever before and help them become local champions.

He launched a national search for talented 'school gate mums and dads' to step forward and make real change to real lives in their communities.

![embed: ](http://www.youtube.com/v/dYNGsL4JYjM?fs=1&hl=en_GB&rel=0)

The Localism Bill, to be published shortly, will help place councillors centre stage in their communities with more clout than ever before to get things done for the people they serve on a whole range of issues. Measures will include freeing councillors from restrictions that prevent them from championing local issues, allowing councils to return to the Committee system meaning all councillors are directly involved in decision-making and a new simpler and transparent standards regime ending the system that Ministers believe fuelled petty and malicious complaints.

So Mr Shapps launched a new talent show called 'Your Community Needs You' - a search for community champions, people with the X Factor who have a track record of getting things done in their area. He is encouraging them to put their names on the ballot papers for next year's local elections.

He today kicked off this search for local stars by encouraging 'school gate mums and dads' - people with energy and passion, people who know what needs doing and are used to going out and doing it - to bring their skills and experience to bear and consider standing for election.

Mr Shapps argued that for many, becoming a councillor is the last thing on their mind, and that they will have previously been put off by the steady erosion of power of councillors and the endless restrictions placed on them in recent years.

But with the pressing need to get the nation's finances back on track every community faces tough choices and needs talented people who are part of their community to make these decisions. Mr Shapps said there has never been a better reason or time for these talented people to put themselves forward.

Mr Shapps made clear his admiration for those existing councillors who despite the restrictions placed on them have continued to champion their communities. But with these restrictions set to become a thing of the past, the Minister said he wants to see a new generation to join this army of community champions.

In a speech to parents and students at Bishop's Hatfield School Grant Shapps said:

> ""There are tens of thousands of people across the country - like the 'school gate mums and dads' - already doing great things for their local area. They have a track record of getting things done - whether fundraising, volunteering as Governors or running clubs.
> 
> ""They have energy, passion, know what needs doing and go out and do it, and are networked like never before. But many would have never considered being a councillor and would be put off by the petty rules and mindless bureaucracy too often associated with being a councillor.
> 
> ""Times are changing and Government is ending Whitehall's iron grip over local communities - pushing power down from Whitehall to your Town Hall and from Downing Street to your street.
> 
> ""Local councillors will be placed centre stage with more clout than ever before to get things done for the communities they serve. After years of tying the hands of local councillors we are now setting them free.
> 
> ""But we need talented people who can seize the opportunities this seismic shift in the balance of power presents. So my message to school gate mums and dads and other community champions is clear. Your Community Needs You. I know this talent show might be less glamorous than the X Factor but if you win the prize is huge. You will be able to make real changes to real lives in your own community.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1794678,Six steps to return power to the people,"Six essential actions to create a new decentralised Britain where power once again belongs to the people, have been set out today by the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark.

The Coalition Government believes in a radical shift of power from the centre to citizens and communities, giving control and freedom back to people to manage their own lives as they see fit.

The Localism Bill, which begins its passage through parliament today, will provide the legislative foundation for putting power back into the hands of communities. But it will also require fundamental changes in the way government works at every level.

To achieve and maintain the radical shift in power, the Government has published  _Decentralisation and the Localism Bill: an essential guide_. Its sets out six actions central government will need to take to do things differently - in behaviour, expectation, and culture, which must go alongside the changes in law proposed in the Bill.

They are to:

  * **Lift the burden of bureaucracy** - by removing the cost and control of unnecessary red tape and regulation, whose effect is to restrict local action;
  * **Empower communities to do things their way** - by creating rights for people to get involved with, and direct the development of, their communities;
  * **Increase local control of public finance** - so that more of the decisions over how public money is spent and raised can be taken within communities;
  * **Diversify the supply of public services** - by ending public sector monopolies, ensuring a level-playing field for all suppliers, giving people more choice and a better standard of service;
  * **Open up government to public scrutiny** - by releasing government information into the public domain, so that people can know how their money is spent, how it is used and to what effect; and
  * **Strengthen accountability to local people** - by giving every citizen the power to change the services provided to them through participation, choice or the ballot box.

Nick Clegg said:

> ""The Coalition Government is different from governments that have gone before. It is different by its very nature: two parties coming together in the national interest marked a watershed in our politics. But the Coalition is different in its approach, too. Because instead of taking more power for the Government, the Localism Bill will give power away. This Bill, as this guide sets out, marks the beginning of a power shift away from central government to the people, families and communities of Britain.""

Greg Clark said:

> ""Britain has become one of the most centralised countries and it hasn't worked. Our public services have suffered because of bureaucratic micro-management by the centre, and public trust in our democratic institutions has been undermined, with people feeling they have little or no control.
> 
> ""The Coalition Government is determined to redress the balance through a radical shift of power from the centre to citizens and communities. The actions in this guide, embodied in the Localism Bill, will drive our commitment to decentralise power across every department and every level of government - and return power to the people to whom it rightfully belongs.""

### Notes to editors

1. _Decentralisation and the Localism Bill: an essential guide_ is available at  [www.communities.gov.uk/decentralisationguide](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/decentralisationguide).

2. Greg Clark has been appointed by the Prime Minister to work across all Government departments to deliver the decentralisation agenda. 

3.This guide is being published in advance of a progress report on decentralisation to the Prime Minister next year. It is not a formal consultation but any comments are welcome and should be emailed to: [decentralisation@communities.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:decentralisation@communities.gsi.gov.uk).

4. The Localism Bill, laid before Parliament today, contains a radical package of reforms that will devolve greater power and freedoms to councils and neighbourhoods, establish powerful new rights for communities, revolutionise the planning system, and give communities control over housing decisions.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1799890,Grant Shapps launches crackdown on housing fraud,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today launched a new national crackdown on tenancy cheats who unlawfully sublet their council or housing association properties and deny homes to people who really need them.

At least 50,000 social homes in England are being unlawfully occupied - providing the equivalent number of new social homes would cost more than £5 billion, and it is estimated that the number of unlawfully occupied properties ranges from one in 100 in some parts of the country to more than one in 20 social homes in some inner London boroughs.

Tenancy cheats live elsewhere, but can earn thousands of pounds a year charging higher rents for their social homes. If caught, these cheats lose their tenancy and can lose their right to a social home in future.

Those living in these homes may not know about the fraud, but fewer than 5 per cent of those evicted once their 'landlord's' fraud is detected subsequently apply to the council as homeless - they often find alternative accommodation in the private rented sector.

Mr Shapps today announced that the 51 councils doing the most to tackle this menace will receive a share of £19 million to bolster their efforts - which can include dedicated housing officers to investigate allegations, and tenancy audits to ensure the lawful tenants are living in the property.

He outlined how he is looking to back all councils across the country with a dedicated national action team, based at the Chartered Institute of Housing which will be available to offer practical support and advice to local authorities looking to tackle tenancy fraud in their area.

The Minister also said he is looking to lower the cost of using the services of credit reference agencies to help identify potential cheats. The Government is working with the National Fraud Authority to develop standard contracts for councils to agree with credit reference agencies, at standard prices, to lower the costs of using their services.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""Tenancy fraud costs this country billions of pounds, but it's not just the money that's wasted The Housing Waiting list has doubled and tenancy fraud means that tens-of-thousands of people who could otherwise be housed are losing out because of cheats. We cannot afford to ignore this problem.
> 
> ""That's why today I'm launching a national crackdown, bolstering the efforts of councils across the country with £19million Government cash. I'm also going to back them further with a dedicated national action team to help tackle tenancy fraud.
> 
> ""The start of today's campaign is part of a wider Government effort to ensure council homes go to those who need them most. That's why I've launched plans for the biggest shake up in social housing for a generation, including the introduction of more flexible tenancies and greater fairness in the way social homes are allocated.""

Sarah Webb, Chief Executive of the Chartered Institute of Housing, said:

> ""We are delighted to be leading the sector in ensuring they have the professional advice and practical guidance to help them make more of their existing social housing. The new advice team that will be based at CIH will be made up of professionals who can support other professionals in local councils and housing associations to tackle illegal subletting and make the most of existing social housing.
> 
> ""We have also issued a new guide on tackling housing tenancy fraud with the National Fraud Authority today, which brings together examples of initiatives that really work and will help more housing providers ensure social housing goes to those in genuine need.""

Dr Bernard Herdan, CEO, National Fraud Authority said:

> ""Social housing is a valuable national asset which must be protected to provide homes for those who need them the most. In a time where demand is outstripping supply, it is imperative we tackle the fraudsters denying low income families access to proper accommodation and profiting from unlawful subletting.
> 
> ""The NFA is dedicated to working with Government and local authorities to reduce the impact fraud has on the public sector and the impact it has on society.""

Councils are working alongside their local housing associations to identify tenancy cheats in their area and free up the homes for people who need them most. Recent examples of successful investigations include:

  * Ms K obtained a tenancy on a two-bedroomed flat from **Ealing Council** from January 1991 by using false papers and a false identity to prove she'd been made homeless by her landlady. Instead, for the next 18 years she continued to live in a property she owned while subletting the flat, and claiming housing and council tax benefits. When her unlawful subletting was discovered council officers took legal action against her, and she pleaded guilty to six charges under the Theft Act, and was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment. The judge also granted a confiscation order for £290,451, Ealing Council were awarded £76,697 in compensation and Ms K was ordered to pay £6,132 to cover prosecution costs. Ms K has already paid over £68,000 towards the amount she owes but if she fails to repay the full amount within 12 months her prison sentence will be increased to three years.
  * After making several visits to one of their properties in South East London, **Gallions Housing Association** eventually received a reply from a man claiming to be the brother of the tenant, Mr B, who he claimed was out at work. At a later visit, the man claiming to be Mr B produced a UK driving licence as proof of identity. However, the housing officers quickly established that the photograph on the licence bore little resemblance to that in the records held on Mr B by Gallions. Further inquiries revealed that the real Mr B had been living in Baltimore, USA, for some time. The individual living at the property admitted he was a friend of Mr B's. Mr B contacted investigators and agreed to sign a tenancy termination notice, returning the property to Gallions Housing Association for a family in need.
  * Housing officers at **Kensington and Chelsea Borough Council** discovered one of their homes being offered to rent through a local letting agency. When they visited the address, they discovered that a local businessman was living there paying £300 a week rent to the person holding the tenancy, Mr L. The council took legal action, and Mr L was ordered to pay £7,179.52 - which included costs, rent arrears and the £2,993.70 profit he made while sub-letting the property.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1800967,Andrew Stunell outlines plans to improve building regulations,"Communities Minister Andrew Stunell has today outlined a programme of work to improve the system of building regulation in England.

Changes will look to reduce the regulatory burden on builders, making it easier and cheaper for them to comply. The programme results from an exercise that asked the industry to identify the changes that really needed to be made, either to the technical standards themselves or the regime more generally to secure compliance.

In a statement to Parliament, Mr Stunell reaffirmed the commitment that Building Regulations relating to the conservation of fuel and power will be revised, delivering the necessary next steps towards zero carbon buildings, and considering how they may support wider retrofit policies.

He also said he would examine how regulations might be used to ensure suitable toilet and changing facilities are offered for people with multiple and profound disabilities in new developments and explore further how building regulations could be used to help improve the security of new homes.

The Minister also reiterated the Government's determination to manage this process through a ""one-in, one-out"" approach to regulation, ensuring that the cost of any new regulations is offset by regulatory savings of at least the same value.

In response to significant concerns raised by many in the industry, the Minister also plans to evaluate how the Building Regulations relating to electrical safety can be changed to lower the costs of compliance. He also set out plans to examine a number of other regulations where there may be an opportunity to not only reduce the cost to business, but also improve compliance.

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""At the end of July I asked the building industry to tell me their ideas about what in the Building Regulations and associated processes needed to be improved or extended, where we might reduce the regulatory burdens and how we might deliver even better levels of compliance.
> 
> ""Today, I'm publishing the findings of that process. In the coming year, I plan to look at how we ensure our regulations are as effective as they can be in delivering safe and sustainable buildings.
> 
> ""The success of this process is dependent on consultation with those at the frontline of the construction industry, building the homes and buildings that this country needs. That's why for me this is just the start of the process - their contribution has informed my programme of work for the next year, and I want to work with them further to ensure building regulations are fit for the 21st century.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1803322,Herefordshire flag to fly at Department for Communities and Local Government,"The flag representing the historic county of Herefordshire has been hoisted above the offices of the Department for Communities and Local Government.

![Image: Councillors from Herefordshire Council holding the county flag](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1803315.jpg)Cllr John Stone and Cllr Roger Phillips, leader of Herefordshire Council, with the county flag.

To celebrate the important place counties play in the nation's cultural heritage Secretary of State Eric Pickles has asked that English county standards be flown alongside the Union Flag outside the Department's Eland House headquarters in Victoria.

Mr Pickles raised the first flag - for his adopted home county of Essex - in a ceremony also attended earlier this year by celebrity astrologer and long-time English county campaigner Russell Grant.

Flags are being flown for a week at a time in alphabetical order or - in cases such as Cornwall and Yorkshire - to coincide with particular county days.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""The Union Flag rightly has pride of place outside the Department but I'm delighted it will now be flown alongside our traditional and ceremonial county flags.
> 
> ""England's counties continue to form an important part of our cultural and local identity in this country and many people remain deeply attached to their home county - both the traditional 'cricket' counties and in some cases their more modern administrative successors. This sense of pride and shared identity is one of the things that binds communities together and it's right that the Government department responsible for communities and local government should be actively recognising the important role they play.""

HM Lord-Lieutenant of Herefordshire, The Countess of Darnley, said:

> ""Herefordshire has a rich and diverse heritage of which we are justifiably proud.
> 
> ""The county's blend of the traditional and the contemporary gives it a unique character which draws visitors back year after year.
> 
> ""Its many traditional businesses are developing new locally sourced products with great success, whilst many new enterprises are delivering niche high-end technological products and broadening our employment base.
> 
> ""For these reasons I'm delighted that Herefordshire is being recognised for all it is and stands for at this time of Advent, as its flag flies above the offices of the Department for Communities and Local Government in central London.""

Cllr John Stone, chairman of Herefordshire Council, said:

> ""I'm delighted that Herefordshire's flag will be flown outside the Department for Communities and Local Government.
> 
> ""Herefordshire is one of our most rural counties with agriculture still playing a vital role in the local economy.
> 
> ""There are increasing numbers of visitors who appreciate Herefordshire's magnificent countryside and tranquillity as well as its history and traditions.
> 
> ""Tourism is also important to the local economy as are our plethora of small businesses, which will benefit from the imminent improvement in broadband coverage.
> 
> ""Herefordshire is proud of its past but is also looking forward to the future with high standards in its schools and colleges and wants our young people to stay and live and work in the county.
> 
> ""Herefordshire has a sense of identity which has served it well in the past and will do so in the future and it is fitting that the county flag will be flying outside the Department in London.""

### Notes to editors

1. The Department is obliged to fly the European Union flag during Europe Week (w/c 9 May) under Article 7(2) of EC Regulation 1828/2006.

2. The Herefordshire flag has been kindly loaned by the local authority at no charge.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1803629,Fire Minister Bob Neill calls time on FiReControl,"Fire Minister Bob Neill MP today reached agreement with the main FiReControl contractor, Cassidian (formerly EADS Defence and Security), to call a halt to the troubled project. The Minister made it clear in the summer that Cassidian must deliver the main IT system to time, cost and quality. The Department and the contractor have now jointly concluded that the project requirements cannot be delivered to an acceptable timeframe.

Ministers believe that the interests of both the fire and rescue community and the taxpayer are now best served by closing down the project.

FiReControl is the third part of the last Government's Fire and Resilience Programme - the other two, Firelink and New Dimension, have been delivered. The project aimed to replace England's 46 standalone fire and rescue control rooms with a national network of nine control centres.

In a Written Ministerial Statement to Parliament today Bob Neill said:

> ""The progress of the project has caused serious concern, and so in June this year I made it clear to the main FiReControl contractor, Cassidian (formerly EADS Defence and Security), that the main IT system must now be delivered to time, cost and quality. At this point, we activated a key milestone in their contract requiring the main IT system to be completed in three control centres by mid-2011.
> 
> We told Cassidian that no additional taxpayers' money could be invested in this project, nor would delivery of a system of reduced quality or functionality be acceptable.
> 
> Following extensive discussion with Cassidian, we have jointly concluded, with regret, that the requirements of the project cannot be delivered to an acceptable timeframe. Therefore the best outcome for the taxpayer and the fire and rescue community is for the contract to be terminated with immediate effect. Cassidian and the Department for Communities and Local Government have reached an acceptable settlement over this although the details will remain commercially confidential.""

The Minister thanked the many operational experts and other representatives from the fire and rescue community for their contribution to the project. Today's decision gives more operational certainty to the Fire and Rescue Service as well as financial certainty to the taxpayer.

The Department will now consult with the fire and rescue community on the future of control room services in England. This will be based on the principles of localism and seek feedback on the best use of FiReControl assets.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1804082,Grant Shapps: Next steps on the road to zero carbon,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today announced the Government is on track to turn its commitment for greener homes into a reality, and set out the next steps to new homes being zero carbon from 2016.

With over a quarter of all the UK's emissions coming from homes, there is widespread consensus that quick and effective action needs to be taken to set a clear environmental standard for future homes to ensure that they do not add to the UK's carbon footprint. 

To speed up progress towards finalising a zero carbon approach, Grant Shapps asked the Zero Carbon Hub to gather the evidence about where to set a national benchmark for measures that can be taken on-site to reduce carbon emissions. The Hub's work brought together academia, industry experts and green groups such as the World Wildlife Fund, the Energy Saving Trust, and the UK Green Building Council.

Their findings, presented to the Government today, set out the evidence for what works, and what will deliver real-world carbon savings. The recommendations include reductions that can be achieved beyond the bricks and mortar - building homes with renewable energy technologies on site, such as solar power and heat pumps.

Mr Shapps also confirmed the Government is exploring how housebuilders can reduce the carbon footprint of new homes by supporting renewable energy schemes in their local area. Many groups have argued for a Community Energy Fund, which would enable zero carbon to be met partly through contributions to a fund used to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Mr Shapps said the Community Infrastructure Levy, which was recently finalised, will give councils the option for new housing development in their area to contribute funds towards local renewable energy generation.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""We are committed to ensuring that new homes do not add to our carbon footprint. But whilst making sure these tough environmental standards are met, we will not dictate how every home should be built. So I welcome the findings of the Zero Carbon Hub, and will consider them with real interest.
> 
> ""We're serious about building greener homes, but also committed to finding the most practical way of doing this. And for good reasons - if we're going to be successful in reducing our carbon emissions, we need to ensure the councils and developers who are actually going to deliver these changes are on board.
> 
> ""That's why we're also giving the people at the sharp end of delivering zero carbon further options to invest in local renewable energy schemes, which will provide councils and developers the flexibility they need to meet these standards.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1804410,Planning paperwork to be radically cut back to help communities drive development,"A radical overhaul of planning policy cutting out thousands of unnecessary central instructions and putting communities at the heart of decision making, has been announced today by Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark.

In recent years, the planning system has become overloaded with central guidance and statements, with vast amounts of paperwork making it too cumbersome for councils, developers and local people to use effectively.

Too much unwanted detail has resulted in a system full of contradictions and has acted as a brake on growth, hindering rather than helping local communities to shape development in their neighbourhoods.

Today Mr Clark is announcing an end to the centralist approach to planning with an ambitious plan designed to consolidate dozens of existing policy statements, circulars and guidance documents into a single national planning policy framework.

The new framework will:

  * hand power back to local communities to decide what is right for them - instead of imposing excessive rigid rules from the centre
  * be more user-friendly and accessible, so that it is easier for members of the public to have a meaningful say in planning decisions
  * make sure that planning is used as a mechanism for delivering Government objectives only where it is relevant, proportionate and effective to do so
  * establish a presumption in favour of sustainable development.

Planning professionals, local authorities, community groups and members of the public will have an opportunity to shape the new framework. Mr Clark is today inviting organisations and individuals to offer their views to the Department on what priorities and policies the Government might adopt to produce the shorter, more decentralised and less bureaucratic national planning policy framework.

Mr Clark said:

> ""We have over 1000 pages of policy and guidance that have made the planning system unclear and burdensome.
> 
> ""This creates vast amounts of paperwork and bureaucracy that burdens developers and limits the power of local people to shape their neighbourhoods around their vision.
> 
> ""The new framework will integrate our current suite of policy statements and guidance into a single concise document. It will focus on the Government's key priorities for planning and help deliver a more effective, decentralised system.""

Today Mr Clark also set out a Work Plan on major infrastructure planning reform to deliver nationally important new infrastructure that will drive economic growth. This includes the steps to be taken to abolish the Infrastructure Planning Commission and drive major planning reform.

Securing investment in new infrastructure is essential to delivering growth over the coming decades. There is expected to be £200 billion of private and public sector investment in infrastructure over the next five years.

Planning decisions on infrastructure of this scale are so important that the Government believes it is right that these decisions should be taken by democratically elected representatives and not by the Infrastructure Planning Commission, an unelected quango.

A new Major Infrastructure Planning Unit, established within the Planning Inspectorate, will take over the IPC's responsibilities once it is abolished. The new Unit will provide advice to Ministers who will take the decisions on nationally important infrastructure projects and grant permissions.

The Government has committed to making decisions at least as quickly as the twelve months allowed under the major infrastructure planning regime and is considering whether we can reduce the timeframe further.

Mr Clark also confirmed the Government's commitment to the delivery of critically important National Policy Statements for new infrastructure.  These will set out the Government's policy on major infrastructure projects such as ports or power stations.

Mr Clark added:

> ""Securing investment in new infrastructure is essential to help rebuild the UK economy and provide new jobs.  We cannot expect to meet the needs of tomorrow with yesterday's infrastructure and reform of the planning system is vital to securing essential investment and achieving economic growth.""

### Notes to editors

#### National Planning Policy Framework

1. The National Planning Policy Framework will streamline the national planning policies set out in Planning Policy Guidance notes, Planning Policy Statements, Minerals Policy Statements and Minerals Policy Guidance notes, plus a number of related Circulars. There are around 40 such documents.

2. The guidance notes and statements cover various planning aspects of climate change, housing, renewable energy, flood risk, Green Belt and waste, and procedural advice such as how to compile development plans.

3. The Government will continue to maintain Green Belt protection, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, National Parks, Sites of Special Scientific Interest and other environmental designations which protect the character of our country's landscape, stop unsustainable urban sprawl and preserve wildlife.

4. There are also over 100 advisory guidance notes including best practice guides. These will be cut back. Too much weight is often given to this kind of guidance, especially when many professional bodies produce high quality advisory material that is equal or of more use to users of the planning system.

5. National Policy Statements, which will set out the Government's policy on major infrastructure projects such as ports or power stations, will not be included in the Framework.

6. Organisations and individuals will be invited to offer views on priorities and policies that should be included in the new slimlined framework before a draft is produced and available for formal consultation.

#### Major Infrastructure Planning Reform Work Plan

1. For the majority of schemes, decisions will be taken by the Secretary of State responsible for the policy: the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change will take decisions on major energy infrastructure and the Secretary of State for Transport will take decisions on major transport infrastructure.

2. We envisage that applications relating to hazardous waste will be determined by the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, and that applications relating to waste water and water supply will be determined jointly by the Secretaries of State for Communities and Local Government and Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.

3. Subject to Royal Assent of the Localism Bill and commencement of relevant legislation, the Infrastructure Planning Commission will be abolished and its functions transferred to the Secretary of State.

4. The Localism Bill was introduced to Parliament on 13 December. Subject to parliamentary time being made available we anticipate that commencement of the relevant parts of the Act will be in April 2012.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1804892,Residents can now see where council funding goes,"As part of the Government's commitment to transparency, ministers have today taken steps to de-mystify the complex formula grant funding system by publishing further analysis of the way in which central government funding will be distributed per resident around country.

Last week a plain English guide to the provisional Local Government settlement was published alongside a series of spreadsheets, formulas and figures to assist people who understandably may not know their formula grant from their damping floor. 'A Plain English Guide to the Local Government Finance Settlement for 2011-12' is available here [www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/pdf/1796186.pdf](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/pdf/1796186.pdf).

Ministers have today published the results of a ready reckoner on local government finance that shows how much money is being allocated per head per council. These figures have been mapped to show at a glance how the £21.5 billion of central taxpayer funding for local government is distributed around the country.

![](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1804775)

The data makes it easy to see how much money is being made available for every individual in any given area in England. It shows is that those areas of the country that are most dependant on central government funding are receiving the lion's share of the money that is available. The figures also underline the fact that the settlement is fair between different parts of the country - north and south, rural and urban, metropolitan and shire.

Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""When it comes to the way local government budgets are allocated it is not the technicalities taxpayers care about. What they want to know is how much money their council is receiving and what that means in terms of cash per person.
> 
> ""The formula for working out local government finance runs to 152 pages. Getting information out in more accessible formats is about simplifying this complex but important process so that taxpayers can see where their money is going.
> 
> ""What the data shows is that funding fairness underpins this settlement. The settlement is fair between different parts of the country - north and south, rural and urban, metropolitan and shire.
> 
> ""By adopting an intelligent and fair approach to the way funding is allocated we are getting formula grant to where it is needed most. We have been able to ensure those parts of the country that are most reliant on central funding continue to get the lion's share of the taxpayers' money that is available.""

### Notes to editors

1. The data published today shows that average formula grant funding per head in 2011-12 is £559.36.

2. A table showing formula grant funding per head for 2011-12 can be found here: [http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/newsroom/1786823/1804766.xls](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/newsroom/1786823/1804766.xls).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1805807,Stay safe and warm this Christmas,"With the country in the grip of what's set to be the coldest December for 100 years, England's Fire and Rescue Services are advising their residents to stay safe as they keep warm and the colder weather continues to bite.

Latest fire statistics show that the number of injuries and deaths from accidental fires in 2008 were at their peak in December and January, while provisional statistics for 2009/10 show that nearly 2000 fires were started by electric blankets, candles or portable heaters last year, resulting in 406 casualties and fatalities.

Fire Minister Bob Neill said:

> ""As the colder weather continues to bite it's only natural that we spend more time indoors and endeavour to stay as warm as possible. There's nothing like a cosy open fire or the added warmth of an electric blanket, but these and other winter must-haves like candles can bring an increased risk of fire into the home.
> 
> ""Make sure you stay both warm and fire-safe this winter and remember to test your smoke alarm every week.  Working smoke alarms save lives.""

The Government's Chief Fire and Rescue Adviser Sir Ken Knight said:

> ""Additional measures to keep warm such as heaters are a common sight at this time of year but despite the winter comfort they can bring it's important to remember the risks they bring.
> 
> ""By following some simple rules you can ensure you stay safe and warm and if you are in any doubt over any fire safety issues, your local Fire and Rescue Service are on hand to help and offer advice. We all want to be warm in winter, but we must avoid tragedy.""

The Fire Kills Campaign has released the following advice to help you reduce your fire risk this winter:

#### Fires and Heaters

Open fires can provide a relaxing and atmospheric way to keep warm, whereas portable heaters can be handily moved around but it's important to use them safely:

  * always use a fire guard to protect an open fire against flying sparks and hot embers and make sure embers are under control and properly put out before you go out or go to bed
  * keep portable heaters away from curtains and furniture and never use them for drying clothes. Always unplug electric heaters when you go out and go to bed.

#### Electric Blankets

Electric blankets can help you keep warm during the cold nights, but fires can be devastating with 440 injuries resulting from every 1000 fires started by an electric blanket. Therefore, there are fire safety issues to consider:

  * never use hot water bottles in the same bed as an electric blanket, even if the blanket is switched off
  * unplug blankets before you get into bed, unless they have a thermostat control for safe all-night use
  * store electric blankets flat or rolled up or loosely folded to prevent damaging the internal wiring.

#### Candles

Candles may also be used more to lighten up the dark evenings. As with open fires, a naked flame brings risks if they are not treated carefully. Make sure that candles are secured in a proper holder, and away from materials that may catch fire like curtains. It is also very important that candles are put out completely when you leave the room or go to bed.

For further information on fire safety please visit [www.direct.gov.uk/firekills](http://www.direct.gov.uk/firekills) (external link) or contact your local Fire and Rescue Service to arrange a free Home Fire Risk Check.

### Notes to editors

Provisional statistics show that nearly 2000 fires were caused by electric heaters, electric blankets and candles in 2009/10. Figures will be verified upon publication of Fire Statistics UK during Summer 2011.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,22 December 2010
http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1809061,Pubs see in the New Year with lifeline from Minister,"Pubs Minister Bob Neill has given the pubs industry a hearty New Year cheer after pledging to review the rules that prevent precious community pubs and hubs from reopening again as public houses or entertainment venues.

Mr Neill said that a public consultation will look at the issue of 'restrictive covenants', a clause that can be used in the sale of a building that restricts the use by new owners. Pubs groups such as the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA), have said that covenants can be used by large companies to limit competition and close local pubs, with no hope of having them reopened.

Pubs Minister, Bob Neill, said:

> ""The pubs and clubs in our community can be the heart and soul of a town, village or street and many of us will be heading off to our local this evening to celebrate the New Year. But too many are being closed down, depriving communities of important places to get together with their neighbours for a quick pint and a catch up.
> 
> ""For too long now communities have felt shut out when rules prevent a building being used again as a public house or community club. I want to stop that and put local people in charge. By reviewing the use of this restrictive piece of red tape it is another boost for localism and means that communities could use their collective powers to keep important hubs of community life open.""

Large pub companies often use covenants to remove competition or when there is a motive to change the use of a pub, to residential or commercial use. CAMRA, the Plunkett Foundation and Pub is the Hub have previously said that pub covenants are too restrictive.

By changing the use of restrictive covenants, communities have greater opportunity use the new 'Community Right to Buy' power in the Localism Bill, and take over a local pub if it comes up for sale.

The Right to Buy measure gives local groups the legal right to nominate any vital community asset including local shops, pubs, libraries and leisure centres to be assessed for recording on a 'most wanted' list by the local council. If a listed asset goes on the open market, its sale will be delayed triggering a 'community countdown' that will give people time to prepare their business plan and raise the funds they need to bid.

Mike Benner, the Chief Executive of CAMRA said:

> ""Restrictive covenants are used by pub companies to deprive local communities of their pubs, at a time when 29 pubs are closing every week. Between 2004 and 2009, this happened to almost 600 pubs.
> 
> ""This announcement that the Government will consult on the use of restrictive covenants is a great success for localism, and shows that Government recognises that pubs are vital community assets that need to be protected. For the new community right to buy scheme announced in this week's Localism Bill to work, pubs need to be available for communities to keep open.
> 
> ""It's a victory too for people power: this proposal came from communities on the ground, via their local councils who put the proposals to central Government.""

### Notes to Editors

  1. Three local councils (Darlington, Newcastle upon Tyne and Ryedale) have applied under the Sustainable Communities Act that the Government take action on the issue of restrictive covenants. As a result, the government agreed to a public consultation on the issue as a means to understand the local level impact of covenants on communities. Further information about the Sustainable Communities Act can be seen here: [http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/communities/scadecisions](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/communities/scadecisions)
  2. By Summer 2011, DCLG will undertake a public consultation on the issue of covenants, with a particular focus on pub covenants and the local level impact on communities. The consultation will also look at whether power for either local or central government would be necessary and useful to aid the issue and what form any powers would take.
  3. The Community Right to Buy measures are included in the Localism Bill, announced on Monday 13 December.
  4. The Community Right to Buy will require local authorities to maintain a list of sites of community value put forward for consideration by communities. The local authority will assess the suggestions before recording on the list. When listed land comes up for disposal (either the freehold or a long leasehold), communities will be given the chance to develop a bid and raise the capital to buy the asset. They will then be in a better position to bid to buy the asset when it comes on the market at the end of the moratorium.
  5. This will help local communities to save sites which are important to the community, which will contribute to tackling social need and building up resources in their neighbourhood. The Bill will provide the framework for the Right, the detail of which will be set out in secondary legislation, and subject to public consultation in the New Year.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1809662,Hertfordshire flag flies at Department for Communities and Local Government,"The flag representing the historic county of Hertfordshire has been hoisted above the offices of the Department for Communities and Local Government.

To celebrate the important place counties play in the nation's cultural heritage Secretary of State Eric Pickles has asked that English county standards be flown alongside the Union Flag outside the Department's Eland House headquarters in Victoria.

Mr Pickles raised the Hertfordshire flag today - in a ceremony also attended by Rob Gordon, Leader of Hertfordshire County Council, and Grant Shapps whose Welwyn Hatfield constituency is in the county.

Flags are being flown for a week at a time in alphabetical order or - in cases such as Cornwall and Yorkshire - to coincide with particular county days.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""The Union Flag rightly has pride of place outside the Department but I'm delighted it will now be flown alongside our traditional and ceremonial county flags.
> 
> ""England's counties continue to form an important part of our cultural and local identity in this country and many people remain deeply attached to their home county - both the traditional 'cricket' counties and in some cases their more modern administrative successors. This sense of pride and shared identity is one of the things that binds communities together and it's right that the Government department responsible for communities and local government should be actively recognising the important role they play.""

Rob Gordon, Leader of Hertfordshire County Council, said:

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1812648,Pickles acts to protect the rights of homeowners,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles is today bringing an end to heavy handed rules that can mean people who leave their house empty for more than six months risk having it seized by their local authority.

In 2006, the previous Government introduced 'Empty Dwelling Management Orders'. They allow councils to take over properties that have been empty for as little as six months.

  * the home does not have to be blighted or boarded up to be taken over, just empty for six months - including homes of the deceased
  * councils have the right to seize furniture, fixtures and fittings, when the home is taken over, including where the home has been left empty for a period after the owner has died
  * homes already on the property market can be seized if councils believe the asking price is ""unrealistic"".

In order to protect civil liberties, Mr Pickles is today introducing powerful safeguards to restrict the use of Empty Dwelling Management Orders.

  * they will be limited to empty properties that have become magnets for vandalism, squatters and other forms of anti-social behaviour - blighting the local neighbourhood
  * a property will have to stand empty for at least two years before an Empty Dwelling Management Order can be obtained, and property owners will have to be given at least three months' notice before the order can be issued.

Mr Pickles is concerned that councils have used the Orders to instigate action against homeowners that is inappropriate, including against people in vulnerable situations. Councils have, for example, attempted to use the powers against a homeowner whilst she was caring for her injured daughter in France; to take over an Order being used against the house of a 96 year old as soon as he passed away in a nursing home; and against a divorcee, who faced action because he only lived in the property at weekends to visit his estranged children.

These new safeguards will ensure that responsible homeowners do not face having their properties seized. Mr Pickles said it is wrong that a bereaved family could face having their loved one's home seized for a period if there is a delay in them deciding what to do with it.

The move comes as the Government prepares to introduce wider plans to bring back into use many of the 300,000 properties in England that have been empty for a long period of time.

From next year, councils will have a new incentive to bring empty properties back into use through a New Homes Bonus, under which the Government will match the council tax raised from any council tax collected from a property that previously stood empty.

Communities and Local Government Secretary, Eric Pickles, said:

> ""There is a case for action to put boarded-up and blighted properties back into use. But these draconian and heavy-handed state powers have allowed councils to seize private homes in perfect condition, including their fixtures and fittings, just because the homes have been empty for a short while.
> 
> ""The Coalition Government is standing up for the civil liberties of law-abiding citizens. Fundamental human rights include the right to property. People suffering the loss of a loved one should not have to endure the added indignity of having their home seized because of a delay in them deciding what to do with it.
> 
> ""That's why the new Government is introducing new safeguards that mean the rights of responsible homeowners will be protected, while allowing action to be taken against genuine derelict buildings which blight neighbourhoods.""

### Notes to editors

1. The Government will use secondary legislation to introduce safeguards that restrict the use of Empty Dwelling Management Orders 2006, and will be engaging with interested parties on the extent of the changes.

2. In 2006, the previous Government introduced new 'Empty Dwelling Management Orders' (EDMO) that give town halls the power to take over the management of private homes which have been empty for as little as six months.

  * There are two types of EDMO - an interim EDMO which lasts for a year during which time the local authority must try to work with the owner to get the property back into use. If no agreement is reached the local authority can make a final EDMO which can last for up to seven years.

  * The home does not have to be run down or uninhabitable to be seized, merely empty for six months.

  * Homes of the deceased can be confiscated for up to seven years, even if inheritance issues are not yet finalised. The regulations allow for the home of a deceased person to be seized at any point after six months from the 'grant of representation' (the proof of legal authority allowing a personal representative to start administering an estate).

  * The council is not obliged to obtain a market rent, but in most cases can still deduct all their running costs from the rent.

  * Tenants in the home still have contractual and legal rights of occupancy, making it more difficult to return the property to the owner if the Order is revoked.

3. In guidance issued in 2009, the previous Government called for local authorities to make use of these powers. The guidance can be found at [http://www.emptyhomes.com/usefulresources/edmos.html](http://www.emptyhomes.com/usefulresources/edmos.html).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1813469,New incentives to tackle the blight of empty homes,"Communities Minister Andrew Stunell has set out how local people can bring back into use empty homes that attract anti-social behaviour and cause misery for neighbours.

The Government is offering powerful new incentives for councils to get empty homes lived in again, matching the council tax raised for every empty property brought back into use - which can be spent as they wish. Mr Stunell urged local communities to work with their council to identify where empty homes are blighting the neighbourhood, and start benefiting from extra cash that can be used to improve the local area.

There are around 300,000 long term empty properties across England. They can easily fall into disrepair, attracting squatters, vandalism and anti-social behaviour, bringing down the neighbourhood. So Mr Stunell is calling on residents to come forward and point out these properties to their local council so action can be taken to tackle the problem.

Under plans recently consulted on, the Government will match through the New Homes Bonus any council tax raised from a property that previously stood empty. The extra funding can be spent to benefit the local community - whether on council tax discounts, boosting local services, renovating more empty properties or improving local facilities.

The funding is part of a two pronged attack to get to grips with the issue of empty homes, and will supplement the £100 million already announced as part of the Spending Review for Housing Associations to bring empty properties back into use.

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""Long-term empty properties easily fall into disrepair, and attract the squatters, vandalism and anti-social behaviour that bring down our local neighbourhoods. With as many as 300,000 long-term empty properties across the UK this precious resource is being squandered.
> 
> ""Empty properties should instead be treated as an asset and brought back into use for those families that need somewhere to live.
> 
> ""That's why we're giving local councils powerful new incentives to tackle the problem. The Coalition government is pledging to match the council tax raised for every property brought back into use to help these properties become homes for thousands of families in need.
> 
> ""It's vital that local communities, councils and owners of empty properties work together to bring properties back into use and begin to tackle this problem that is blighting our local communities.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1814083,Grant Shapps: Neighbours from hell face swifter eviction,"Neighbours from hell who cause misery and fear for their fellow tenants could face swifter eviction, under radical plans outlined today by Housing Minister Grant Shapps.

He announced a package of measures and Government cash towards tackling anti-social behaviour, giving greater support to tenants and landlords.

Currently it can take over a year to remove neighbours from hell, who during that time can cause absolute misery for local residents and bring down the wider neighbourhood.

But Mr Shapps today announced that he plans to strengthen the hand of residents, councils and housing associations to act. So he will introduce a new additional mandatory ground for possession, so those tenants with a track record of anti-social behaviour can be evicted from their council or housing association property much more quickly.

Ministers believe this will lead to a faster and fairer courts process - being found guilty of housing related anti-social behaviour in one court will provide automatic grounds for eviction in the county court, removing the need to prove the incidents of anti-social behaviour for a second time.

To further speed up the courts process, Mr Shapps announced that he would be exploring jointly with the Justice Department whether there were any unnecessary obstacles to the swift resolution of ASB possession cases where serious harm is being caused to individuals and communities.

Mr Shapps has also announced that he will dedicate £300,000 of Government funding to a new central team to help tenants and landlords tackle the blight of neighbours from hell in their communities.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""For too long, too many social tenants have lived in fear of neighbours from hell, whose nasty and vicious behaviour blights their neighbourhoods. Victims and witnesses often have to continue living side by side with the perpetrators while action to evict them drags on for many months and sometimes years.
> 
> ""That's why I want to give hope to these victims that this can and will be stopped. So I will introduce a new mandatory ground for possession, so any tenant convicted of serious anti-social behaviour can be evicted much more quickly. And I'm giving landlords and residents the support they need to reclaim their streets and make their houses feel like homes again.
> 
> ""I want any tenant who comes forward to report anti-social behaviour in their area to get the support they need and deserve. And I want landlords to use the full range of powers at their disposal to tackle this menace head-on, so that the disruptive minority of social tenants don't make everyone else's lives a misery.""

Crime Prevention Minister James Brokenshire said:

> ""Anti-social behaviour ruins lives and damages our communities. It is essential those who raise the alarm and ask for help are listened to and their complaints acted upon promptly.
> 
> ""These measures announced today will give greater powers to social landlords and residents to take a firm stand against the bullies and the troublemakers who commit persistent anti-social behaviour and help protect some of the most vulnerable victims from sometimes daily abuse.""

Mr Shapps will also clarify the rules around the use of 'probationary tenancies', which are normally offered to new tenants for up to a year. The Minister will look to reassure housing associations that they have the same freedoms as council landlords to provide longer 'probationary' tenancies. That will mean all social landlords can be confident that they can extend these less secure tenancies for new tenants by up to six months, giving them the extra time they may need to be certain that these new residents treat their home, and their neighbours, with respect.

The Government is also reviewing the anti-social behaviour tool and powers available to the police, councils and social landlords and will publish a consultation on proposed changes shortly.

Action already taken includes launching a new trial in eight police force areas for handling complaints of anti-social behaviour, which will help to quickly identify and protect the most vulnerable victims. The Government has also appointed Baroness Newlove as Champion for Active, Safer Communities to help drive up confidence in our communities.

### Notes to editors

1. Examples of residents who've stood up to their neighbours from hell include:

  * Tina Tomlinson from Sheffield, who faced months of anti-social behaviour from her neighbour. Almost immediately after moving in August 2009, the neighbour regularly made threats to kill Tina, and attempted to force her way into Tina's flat. Sheffield Homes obtained an ex-parte injunction, but this did not stop the abuse - noise monitoring equipment installed in Tina's flat recorded over 37 hours of threats. In January this year, police and environmental protection officers visited the flats, where they were sworn at and the neighbour threatened to ""knife"" Tina. Sheffield Homes resorted to adding additional security and providing wardens to escort Tina into her home safely. The neighbour was sentenced to 90 days in prison, during which Sheffield Homes obtained a possession order, and she was finally evicted in May this year.
  * Dorothy Stenhouse is in her early eighties, and from Derby. Her next-door neighbour regularly had noisy arguments and fights with his carer, causing Mrs Stenhouse sleepless nights and distress. The neighbour and his carer were also responsible for defacing many garden plants and displays, upsetting other residents. But Mrs Stenhouse also suffered at the hands of her downstairs neighbour, who after being asked to turn down his music, reacted violently and repeatedly smashed her hand between his door and door frame. Mrs Stenhouse's landlord, Derby Homes, has taken legal action against all three perpetrators, and their efforts to reclaim the properties has been strengthened by Mrs Stenhouse spending a whole day giving evidence in court against her neighbours.

2. We are also announcing today that ownership of the Respect Standard setting out best practice on preventing and tackling ASB is being transferred from DCLG to the housing sector. The Chartered Institute of Housing, working closely with the Social Landlords Crime and Nuisance Group and other key partners will lead on an early review of the Standard's content, name and any 'sign-up' arrangements.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1816095,Fire and Rescue Service control room services in England,"The Government has published a consultation on the future of fire and rescue control services in England. This follows the closure of the FiReControl project, announced on 20 December 2010.

Local fire and rescue authorities have a statutory duty to answer emergency calls and mobilise resources. They have continued to fulfil this duty, and be funded to do so, during the lifetime of the project and, consequently, the closure of the project poses no risk to public safety.

Fire Minister Bob Neill MP said:

> ""This Government believes that the fire and rescue community is best placed to decide the future of their control services. No solution will be imposed. The consultation reviews the legacy assets from the project, as well as lessons learnt, and encourages the sector to make best use of these in their future plans, for the benefit of both the taxpayer and local communities.""

The consultation discusses whether the original aims of the project - improving efficiency, national resilience and the technology available to fire and rescue services - are still valid and, if so, how they might be achieved now. It also considers the principles on which available funding should be distributed. The role of central government, if any, is also considered.

A copy of the consultation document is available here [http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/fire/fireandrescuecontrolservices](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/fire/fireandrescuecontrolservices). Copies have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. Responses are requested by 8 April 2011.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1821586,Grant Shapps: Help for older tenants wanting to move,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today offered older tenants struggling to manage and heat their large family homes a dedicated officer to find them smaller properties more suited to their needs.

The Minister argued that this will give these people the key to finding a home they can enjoy, not endure - and can give them the security and dignity they deserve.

Mr Shapps has announced a multi-million pound cash boost to landlords' efforts to better ensure their homes continue meet the needs of their residents.

Ministers are clear that they will not force people to move - but want to provide a helping hand to those wanting to do so.

There are 430,000 under-occupied social homes in England - where tenants have two or more bedrooms more than they require. In many cases, these properties are occupied by elderly tenants whose children have since grown up and moved out.

With more room than they actually need, many of these residents can become prisoners in their own homes, finding it a struggle to look after and heat the properties that are now too big for them to manage.

So Mr Shapps has today confirmed that councils from across the country managing the largest number of homes will get a share of £13million to make it easier for those tenants wanting to move from larger family homes to smaller, more manageable homes, to do so.

Councils will be able to use this funding as they see fit to better meet the needs of their tenants, with measures such as:

  * A dedicated officer to help find residents a suitable new home
  * A moving service to help tenants with every aspect of moving, from joining them on viewings to organising packing and removal services
  * Handymen to decorate and make repairs to their new home, including putting up shelves and installing white goods

Mr Shapps also outlined how he is looking to back all councils across the country with a dedicated new national action team based at the Chartered Institute of Housing, available to offer practical support and advice to those councils looking to help tenants wanting to move.

Those tenants in larger properties that are keen to downsize will also benefit from greater opportunities to swap with some of the quarter of a million households in overcrowded accommodation.

In particular the Localism Bill, currently before Parliament, includes measures to make it easier for social housing tenants to move through a new National Home Swap Scheme.

And with 1.8 million households on social housing waiting lists, many of them families, this funding will also help unlock larger homes for those in greatest need.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""Older people can become the victims of their own changed circumstances, as the homes they have lived in for years become places to endure, not enjoy. As children grow up and fly the nest, these tenants can often find themselves trapped in larger family homes that no longer meet their needs.
> 
> ""That's why I'm giving these residents the chance to start a new life in a new home that better meet their changing needs. Fifty councils from across the country will get a share of £13million to boost their efforts to make it easier for those wanting to downsize to do so.
> 
> ""With a quarter of a million families in overcrowded accommodation and 1.8million households languishing on waiting lists, this will also help unlock larger family homes that are in such high demand.""

Sarah Webb, chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Housing, said:

> ""There are over four million social homes across England and these are incredibly important to current and future tenants, communities and tax-payers. They provide a stable platform from which millions of families are able to find work, send children to school, and contribute to their local neighbourhoods.
> 
> ""With millions more people looking to secure a council or housing association house we need to ensure we are making the most of the homes we've got - this is just as important as building new housing.
> 
> ""That is why CIH is delighted to be working with government to deliver this practical help to support people who want to move to a new home that better suits their changing needs and aspirations.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1821886,"Andrew Stunell: Church groups can bond communities, regardless of faith","Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said this week that church leaders are in a unique position to connect people from different faith groups and to get communities involved in local action.

He paid tribute to the important community work that so many faith based organisations are engaged in and encouraged church groups to use their embedded links in society to put localism into action, whether it's running local youth clubs and campaigns, or simply acting on behalf of a local area.

Mr Stunell made the comments at a speech to senior figures from London churches in Southwark. Representatives from across the Christian denominations gathered to explore ways in which the church can practically engage with the priorities of the Big Society.

Church leaders were encouraged to identify any barriers they encounter when providing services to the community - such as any regulations, byelaws, planning rules or legislation in the way of community action. The Minister also asked how churches can link up with other faith groups and share their skills and knowledge to increase the positive effects of their good work.

Mr Stunell said:

> ""Churches and other religious establishments do a huge amount to improve neighbourhoods and support vulnerable people. They often have a better reach into communities than other organisations, with strong networks on the ground and a significant presence at the heart of their neighbourhood.
> 
> ""This means they are often best placed to bring local people together - of any religious or cultural background - and work with them to achieve common goals.
> 
> ""My Department can help remove unnecessary red tape or legislation that some currently face - and which are likely to be common to all faith based community projects. This, along with measures in the Localism Bill, will mean that groups are empowered to carry out their work even more effectively.
> 
> ""Today's meeting has been a valuable chance to explore the new opportunities for practical action that localism will bring about.""

There are hundreds of examples of churches and other faith communities already providing services and support beyond the limits of their congregation. These include:

  * The Springfield Project, run by St Christopher's Church, has provided a youth group, day care and family support services to a multi-faith community in inner city Birmingham for the last ten years. Their new purpose-built children's centre is run through a partnership between the council and the church.
  * The multi-faith ""Faiths4Change"" initiative helps faith communities from across the North West work together and with other local residents. By offering training and advice on issues of sustainability and social justice, they help local people improve their neighbourhoods and strengthen relationships across the community.

Today's event, attended by around 80 church leaders, is one in a series of discussions Ministers are attending to hear first hand the ideas and concerns of various communities.

Other speakers at the meeting included Jon Cruddas MP and Debra Allcock Tyler from the Directory of Social Change.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1830185,Greater local powers to boost community-led regeneration,"Local Government Minister Grant Shapps and Communities Minister Andrew Stunell have today outlined how the Coalition Government is untying the hands of communities to find innovative ways to regenerate their area.

Ministers have signalled the end to top-down regeneration, which they argue pitted neighbour against neighbour and forced developments on communities that did not want them.

Instead, the Government is looking to devolve a wide range of powers from Whitehall to Town Halls - putting residents, local businesses, local authorities and civil society organisations in the driving seat and providing them with rewards and incentives to drive local regeneration and growth.

These include:

  * increasing local control of council budgets by removing the ringfence from billions of pounds of funding from central Government
  * the new Regional Growth Fund to support private sector enterprise, economic growth, and the creation of sustainable jobs
  * a simplified and streamlined National Planning Policy Framework, giving new powers and rights for local councils and communities to determine and influence what happens in their area.

In addition to this, councils will be able to raise additional funds to invest in their local area through the New Homes Bonus, where central Government will match the council tax raised from new homes built and empty homes brought back into use for the first six years.

Local people will work with councils to decide what to spend the extra money on - whether council tax discounts for local residents, boosting frontline services like rubbish collection or providing local facilities like swimming pools and leisure centres. This will mean that for the first time, communities will be able to see the benefits of development in their area for themselves.

Visiting the Baytree Renewal Area in Manchester, Local Government Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""I want to see an end to the centrally-imposed regeneration regime which pitted neighbour against neighbour and forced developments on communities that did not want them.
> 
> ""That's why we're shifting the balance in favour of communities themselves, untying the hands of councils and residents so they can make the key decisions over how they would like to improve their own neighbourhoods.
> 
> ""Baytree is a great example of this. Local residents working with the Council to ensure that their views were factored into renewal work, and that the wishes of residents - more green spaces, improved security, and action on speeding vehicles and crime - were taken account of.
> 
> ""And with the New Homes Bonus offering powerful incentives for growth, councils will have the opportunity to invest these additional funds in their local area, while residents themselves will for the first time see the benefits of development for themselves.""

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""Communities must no longer face instructions from central Government on regenerating their local areas, but must be free to take the lead and decide for themselves. That's why we're devolving a wide range of powers to councils and their residents alike.
> 
> ""The New Homes Bonus is a key component of this. For the first time, residents will have an incentive to give the green light to new developments in their area, and the extra Government funding they attract will be available for them to use as they see fit.
> 
> ""And neighbourhoods blighted by empty homes and the anti-social behaviour they attract can also benefit from extra Government cash by bringing these properties back into use for families in need.""

Today, Mr Shapps and Mr Stunell have also confirmed a further £5 million funding to encourage the newly-formed Local Enterprise Partnerships and new Local Authority partnerships to work together across boundaries to deliver large scale housing and regeneration schemes in key growth and Housing Market Renewal locations.

These extra freedoms and flexibilities sit alongside nearly £20 billion investment in growth and regeneration from central Government, through new infrastructure projects. This includes:

  * £7.5 billion towards Crossrail, providing significantly improved transport links from West to East London
  * £4.5 billion for new affordable homes, and over £2 billion investment in the Decent Homes programme which will halve the backlog of work, including refurbishing around 150,000 homes in the council sector
  * the £1.4 billion Regional Growth Fund to support private sector economic growth and the creation of sustainable jobs, particularly in areas dependent on public sector employment, which sits alongside another £1.4 billion from the European Regional Development Fund
  * £750 million towards High Speed Rail 2 over the next four years; and
  * £500 million investment to transform the Olympic Park after the 2012 Games to create a new community in East London.

Jackie Sadek, Chief Executive of UK Regeneration, said:

> ""We are delighted that the Government has set out a clear and very simple framework for regeneration. In keeping with its drive on localism the Government is focusing on enabling measures and a few key strategic interventions on transport. This offers all of us a challenge: taking this framework, with limited resources, and making things happen across the country. UK Regeneration is leading that drive.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1830951,Localism Bill impact assessments published,"Evidence underpinning the measures in the Localism Bill to aid analysis and discussion was published today (see link, right).

The Localism Bill will put an end to the centralisation of power in government allowing local communities and councils the freedom to run their lives and neighbourhoods in their own way.

The impact assessments report on the potential impact of implementing the decentralisation and localism elements of the Coalition Agreement. They will help promote the devolution of power away from Westminster and Whitehall to local councils and communities.

Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark said:

> ""Any public policy has pros and cons. In one of the most comprehensive exercises undertaken by any government department to date, we are setting out our frank assessment of the effects of our radical proposals. This demonstrates our commitment to openness and transparency. These reports prove the net benefits to local economies, to local democracy and to community life of the Coalition Government's decentralisation programme.""

The set of Impact Assessments should be considered together within the context of the overall Localism Bill. They cover the following:

  * the abolition of the Standards Board Regime, clarification of the law on predetermination and the requirement to register and declare interests
  * giving councils greater freedoms over their governance arrangements
  * creating executive mayors in the 12 largest English cities
  * local referendums
  * general power of competence
  * general powers for Fire and Rescue Authorities
  * community right to challenge
  * community Right to Buy
  * Business Rates Supplements - requirement for a ballot for all Business Rate Supplement proposals
  * discretionary business rates discounts
  * small business rates relief automation
  * local government senior officer pay accountability
  * cancellation of certain backdated non-domestic rates liabilities
  * provision for referendums to veto excessive council tax increases
  * abolition of the regional planning tier and introduction of the Duty to Cooperate

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1831673,Grant Shapps - new financial deal for council housing,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has fired the starting gun on a council housing revolution that for the first time puts councils and communities in control - allowing them to make long term plans to offer a better deal to England's four million council tenants.

Under this new localist approach councils will have the tools and incentives to more effectively manage their housing stock over the long term, they will be free to make their own decisions about housing assets and through greater transparency tenants and local taxpayers will be better placed to hold their landlord to account.

The Minister today published details of the new financial deal for council housing - a key measure of the Localism Bill currently before Parliament. This includes a detailed description of how each council's opening financial position will be determined and the process for implementing these reforms in April 2012. By providing councils with clarity on funding for the future they can now begin detailed preparations on how they plan to better meet the housing needs of their communities over the long term.

This new approach, developed in partnership with local government, will bring an end to the Housing Revenue Account subsidy system where councils were required to pay council rents to Whitehall which decided how to redistribute it meaning they had no certainty about future income, no ability to plan long term and little incentive to be more efficient.

The new self-financing approach puts councils firmly in control with the tools and incentives they need to manage their housing stock over the long term rather than on a year by year basis. This will be achieved by a one-off adjustment to each council's housing debt after which councils will retain all the rental income they collect. And they will be free to make decisions about their housing assets without first having to get permission from Ministers in Whitehall.

By introducing a direct link between rents councils charge, the money they spend and the services they deliver tenants and local tax payers will be better able to hold their landlords to account. Councils will now for the first time be able to make information about how money is raised and spent publicly available in an easily accessible format. This will include how landlords are improving value for money to their tenants and local tax payers.

The deal includes an extra half a billion per year for councils to spend on their housing stock and extra £116 million funding for councils to pay for disabled adaptations to homes. In total, funding for management, maintenance, repairs and adaptations under the new approach will be 14 per cent higher than under the current subsidy system.

The Localism Bill, that begins its Committee Stage in the House of Commons today, 1 February 2011, includes these measures to repeal the existing subsidy system and replace it with powers for the Secretary of State to introduce self-financing.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""This deal brings to an end a centralised system which meant councils didn't know what funding they would get for housing from one year to the next and were unable to take key decisions about their housing stock. It prevented them from delivering the best possible services for their tenants in the most efficient way.
> 
> ""I am setting councils free to better meet the needs of their tenants. Today I am outlining these new freedoms as well as how each council's opening financial position will be calculated. By giving them clarity on their future revenue and the freedom they have to decide what is best in their local area they can now start preparing for this council house revolution that will begin next year. They now have the tools and incentives to radically overhaul the housing services they provide and deliver better value for money.
> 
> ""And by putting councils in control and making the decisions they take more transparent tenants and local tax payers will be better placed to hold their landlords to account.""

### Notes for editors

#### Introduction

The department has published a policy document on the future financial arrangements for council housing entitled 'Implementing Self-financing'. This is accompanied by:

i. A model which applies the settlement methodology to local authority data to provide indicative figures per council  
ii. A user guide to accompany this model  
iii. A report on the model inputs, assumptions and outputs

These reforms only have implications for each stock-retaining local authority's ring-fenced Housing Revenue Account, and will not impact on their general finances, or on other local authorities. Chapter 5 of 'Implementing Self-financing' has more information on the arrangements which keep money for housing separate from money spent on other services.

Abolition of the subsidy system does not end the requirement for local authorities to maintain a statutory, ring-fenced Housing Revenue Account. Local authorities will still be required to account to their tenants for income from and expenditure to council housing separately from income and spending on other functions and services. This ensures that council taxpayers do not subsidise services specifically for the benefit of tenants and that rent is not used to subsidise functions which are for the benefit of the wider local community.

#### The overall methodology

Valuations will be based on assumptions about each local authority's income and need to spend over 30 years. Assumptions about income will follow from the Government's social rent policy. The assumptions about expenditure needs will reflect evidence commissioned by Government in 2009 and 2010 about the costs of managing, maintaining and repairing the stock. This 30-year cash flow of income and expenditure will then be converted into a capital sum using standard discounted cash flow techniques.

The self-financing valuation will assume that local authorities will follow national social rent policy, which comprises a number of different components:

(i) A 'formula rent' for each property, based on property values, property size and local earnings. Over time, all social landlords are expected to move their rents in line with this formula. At present most housing associations set rents at or close to the formula level, but council rents were on average approximately 8 per cent below this in 2010/11.

(ii) A 'guideline rent' which converges with the formula rent by 2015/16. The valuation will assume convergence with formula rents by 2015/16, followed by rental increase of just above inflation year on year - set at the Retail Price Index + 0.5 per cent per annum.

(iii) A limit on individual rent rises of RPI + 0.5 per cent + £2 each year. This cap prevents excessively high increases in the rents of individual properties as they are moved over time to the formula rent. An estimate will be made for each landlord about the number of tenants whose rents could not move to the formula by 2015/16 without breaching this element of rent policy. The assumed income in the valuation will be reduced by this amount.

The spending needs built into the valuation are based on independent research about actual unit costs (by BRE, HQN and PwC) which are significantly higher than those under the present subsidy system. This approach to costs will give all local authorities more money to spend on managing, maintaining and repairing their stock than under the current system. In aggregate this works out at an increase to £545 million per year for 30 years or a national average Major Repairs Allowance of £956 per dwelling per year and average management and maintenance allowances of £2,061 per dwelling per year.

The assumed rents and costs will be used to produce a notional 30 year business plan of income and expenditure for each local authority landlord's business. This will be converted into a stock valuation using standard discounted cash flow principles, using a 6.5 per cent discount rate.

In order to calculate the payment to or from Government, the valuation will be compared with the notional amount of housing debt supported by Housing Revenue Account subsidy. If the valuation is higher than this assumed debt figure, the local authority will be required to pay Government the difference. If the valuation is lower, the Government will pay the difference to the local authority. Payments from central Government will in most cases not go to local authorities directly, but will be used to redeem debt held by the local authority.

#### The key figure

The key national figures are:

  * the estimated aggregate value of local authorities' housing businesses in 2012 at a discount rate of 6.5 per cent is £28.138 billion
  * the forecast for national Housing Revenue Account debt at April 2012 is £21,428 billion
  * the forecast receipt to the Exchequer is £6.711 billion.

For more information on these national figures including how the valuation, debt levels and receipt have altered since the figures published in March 2010 consultation see Annex A of 'Implementing Self-financing'.

#### The existing system

The existing subsidy system will continue unchanged for 2011/12.  Arrangements for this year are contained in 'Implementing Self-financing'.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1838364,Clark - New boost for community ownership as Government releases central hold on local assets,"Local communities will get the freedom to sell, rent or share community owned assets bought with central government money, such as council buildings, shops and business parks, Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark announced today.

Ministers are ending rigid 'clawback rights' that stopped community and voluntary groups selling or changing the use of community land or buildings that were funded by specific historic government grant programmes. A legacy of centrally imposed restrictions meant that original grant funding was clawed back if one of these local assets were sold or their original purpose changed - even if the government scheme had long since ended.

Ministers are worried that this forces community owned assets to stay stagnant and potentially unused when the land or building could be serving the community. Community and voluntary groups need to be given the freedom and flexibility to use their assets in a way that best meets the area's changing needs.

The removal of 'clawback rights' busts a barrier imposed on local communities by central government. Communities will now be free to use their assets as security to obtain loans to sustain or expand their activities. If an asset is too expensive or no longer fit for purpose they will be able to sell it and move to more appropriate premises that better meets the needs of local people.

Greg Clark said:

> ""Community and voluntary groups who know their area best need a real say on how their local services, buildings and businesses are run. I'm determined to bust every centrally imposed barrier that holds communities back from acting in the best interests of local people.
> 
> ""Today we're ending rigid central restrictions that stopped communities from maximising the potential of their public land and buildings by clawing back central funding. Ending clawback rights will put communities back in charge of community assets and gives them the freedom and flexibility to prioritise their current needs over dated central diktats.""

Councils, voluntary groups and social enterprises have also been invited to let Ministers know of other historic grant programmes where clawback rights have been applied in perpetuity preventing communities from making best use of their assets so that the government can consider whether the terms should be changed too.

Steve Wyler, Director of the Development Trusts Association, said:

> ""This is a fantastic start! For years DTA members have been campaigning for a level playing field. Clawback has meant that enterprising organisations, like our members, have been developing community assets with one hand tied behind their back, the removal of these restrictions will really support them to grow and benefit even more local people. DCLG is giving a great lead on this, let's hope the rest of Government follows suit.""

This is another significant step for communities to take control of their neighbourhoods as the Government pushes power away from the centre. Today's decision follows the launch of consultations on new Community Rights to Challenge local services and Buy vital community assets in the Localism Bill.

The consultations will run for 12 weeks, taking views from people, councils and their employees, community groups, voluntary organisations, private businesses and other interested parties.

Mr Clark has also called on councils to publish their spending on the voluntary and community sector as part of increasing transparency and opening up services locally.

Notes to editors

1. The Department of Communities and Local Government is today removing its capital clawback rights from four historic grant programmes:

  * Single Regeneration Budget (SRB)
  * Urban Programme
  * City Challenge
  * Inner Area Grants.

2. Ministers are also urging councils, voluntary groups and social enterprises to let them know of other historic grant programmes where clawback rights have been applied in perpetuity and are preventing communities from making best use of their assets.

3. Councils will mainly have been the accountable bodies for the grant programme above. They will often have passed some of that funding on to community and voluntary organisations to purchase and renovate assets. With clawback removed Ministers are now encouraging councils to remove any restrictions, such as a charge on the land or building, from community owned assets, giving these groups more flexibility to use the assets for the community.

4. The consultation document for Community Right to Challenge can be viewed online here: [http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/righttochallengeconsultation](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/righttochallengeconsultation) and the consultation document for Community Right to Buy can be viewed here: [http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/righttobuyconsultation](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/righttobuyconsultation).

5. Throughout the consultation period we will be speaking to a wide range of interested parties about the Community Right to Buy and Community Right to Challenge. We will be holding the following consultation events:

  * 9 March, Manchester
  * 22 March, Bristol
  * 31 March, Birmingham
  * 13 April, London

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1840154,Grant Shapps - no room for complacency despite fall in the number of home repossessions,"New figures today from the Council of Mortgage Lenders have shown a three-year low in the number of repossessions.

These figures show that repossessions in the last three months of 2010 were down by 11 per cent compared to the previous quarter, and 24 per cent less than the same period in 2009. The total number of repossessions in 2010 was 36,300 - 16,700 fewer than the 53,000 originally forecast.

Mr Shapps said that the fall in the number of people losing their homes through repossession action was a step in the right direction, but emphasised that there is no room for complacency and work must continue to support people at risk of losing their home.

He said that the Government's ongoing efforts to tackle the record deficit it had inherited must continue in order to avoid rapid increases in interest rates, which would put further pressure on already-stretched family budgets.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""The fall in repossessions is welcome, but I am concerned that too many people are still worrying about losing their homes without seeking support.
> 
> ""I urge anyone who thinks they may be at risk of losing their home to take action immediately. There is help available and repossession should only ever be the very last resort. No one in financial difficulty should be embarrassed to seek help if they need it and worried homeowners should speak to their mortgage lender immediately. They can also visit the Directgov website for help to prepare a personal action plan, or seek expert advice from Shelter, National Debtline or the local Citizens Advice Bureau or local authority.
> 
> ""There are challenges ahead for homeowners in 2011 - so the most important thing that Government can do to keep repossessions as low as possible is to continue our efforts to tackle the record deficit. By doing this we can avoid the need for rapid increases in interest rates, and keep the pressure off homeowners facing financial hardship.""

The most effective thing anyone with money worries can do is to seek early advice and speak to their lender to avoid losing their home. Organisations like Citizens Advice, Shelter, National Debtline and local authorities offer free advice on taking control of your finances. You can also find out more at [www.direct.go.uk/mortgagehelp](http://www.direct.go.uk/mortgagehelp).

Latest figures also published today show that one of the schemes aimed at helping the most vulnerable homeowners, the Mortgage Rescue Scheme, has helped 4,247 households receive help and advice from their local authority in the last quarter, with 2,015 homeowners having completed the full process since the scheme's launch in January 2009.

Separate figures from the Ministry of Justice show that claims leading to a court order have fallen over the last three months of 2010 by eight per cent compared to the same period in 2009, and claims for mortgage possession by lenders between October and December 2010 were two per cent lower than during the same period of 2009. Of the mortgage possession claims that led to orders, 48 per cent were suspended.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1853235,Northamptonshire flag flies at Department for Communities and Local Government,"The flag representing the historic county of Northamptonshire has been hoisted above the offices of the Department for Communities and Local Government.

To celebrate the important place counties play in the nation's cultural heritage Secretary of State Eric Pickles has asked that English county standards be flown alongside the Union Flag outside the Department's Eland House headquarters in Victoria.

Mr Pickles raised the first flag - for his adopted home county of Essex - in a ceremony also attended in September by celebrity astrologer and long-time English county campaigner Russell Grant.

Flags are being flown for a week at a time in alphabetical order or - in cases such as Cornwall and Yorkshire - to coincide with particular county days.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""The Union Flag rightly has pride of place outside the Department but I'm delighted it will now be flown alongside our traditional and ceremonial county flags.
> 
> ""England's counties continue to form an important part of our cultural and local identity in this country and many people remain deeply attached to their home county. This sense of pride and shared identity is one of the things that binds communities together and it's right that the Government department responsible for communities and local government should be actively recognising the important role they play.""

Leader of Northamptonshire County Council, Councillor Jim Harker said:

> ""We are immensely proud that the Northamptonshire flag is being flown outside the Department for Communities and Local Government in London.
> 
> ""Our county lies at the very heart of England. From the main Roman highway of Watling Street, to the seat of numerous medieval parliaments at Northampton, to the decisive civil war battlefield of Naseby, to the home of the British Formula One Grand Prix at Silverstone, it is consistently playing a major role in shaping the national history.
> 
> ""We will continue to ensure that our rich heritage plays a part in guiding the way as we face up to the challenges of the 21st Century.""

### Notes to editors

1. The Department is obliged to fly the European Union flag during Europe Week (w/c 9 May) under Article 7(2) of EC Regulation 1828/2006.

2. The Northamptonshire flag has been kindly loaned by the Northamptonshire County Council at no charge.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1859713,Grant Shapps: Manchester to kickstart green homes revolution,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today unveiled the pioneer project that will pave the way for the green transformation of Britain's social homes - making them warmer and more comfortable to live in, and at the same time cheaper to run.

In the largest scheme of this kind to date, improvements such as solid wall insulation and better heating systems will be made to 9,000 social homes in Manchester to make them more energy efficient.

The cost of the work will be paid upfront by the housing association - tenants will then meet this cost through the money they save on energy bills, which could be up to £500 per year. The project could create more than 1,800 jobs and bring a £100 million boost to local businesses carrying out the home improvements.

The project will test key features of the Green Deal - the Government's new and radical way of making energy efficiency available to all, whether people that own or rent their property. Under the Green Deal, which will begin next year, the expected cash savings for homeowners and tenants will be greater than the costs to upgrade the property over the lifetime of the improvements.

Upgrades will initially be made to 2,500 properties within the Greater Manchester Housing Retrofit Programme, and will prepare the way for Greater Manchester's 260,000 social homes to take up the Green Deal.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""With homes counting for a quarter of all UK emissions, we must and can do more to make our homes greener. That's why we're nailing down a zero carbon approach so tough new green standards can come into effect from 2016.
> 
> ""But we also want to upgrade existing housing stock so everyone can enjoy the benefits of warmer homes and lower energy bills. That's why I'm delighted to announce for the first time, a large scale project to upgrade thousands of social homes.
> 
> ""The scheme in Manchester will save tenants hundreds of pounds on energy bills, and create hundreds of jobs for local people. It shows that going green is not just an environmental necessity; it's also a huge economic opportunity for UK companies to expand their businesses, and become world leaders in the shift to a low carbon economy.""

Energy and Climate Change Secretary Chris Huhne said:

> ""Tenants in Manchester are getting an advance preview of key elements of the Green Deal: they're going to feel the real benefit of warmer and comfier homes at the same time as cutting their energy bills.
> 
> ""I want the Green Deal to work for everyone - whether people own or rent their home. In twenty first century Britain, no one should have to put up with draughty and cold homes.""

Cllr Dave Goddard Chair of the Greater Manchester Environment Commission said:

> ""This is a great opportunity to use the expertise and scale of the social housing sector in Greater Manchester to test implementation of the Government's Green Deal. This will strengthen our work with businesses to develop the skills and jobs to deliver home energy improvements to all our homes, particularly those which are very expensive to heat.
> 
> ""We have strong partnerships in place across Greater Manchester and we are determined to drive the low carbon economy, to constantly build up the social, environmental and economic benefits for all our communities""

Manchester's pioneering scheme will provide a valuable model for upgrading the country's 3.8 million households in the social rented sector, which account for nearly 20 per cent of all households in England. Social landlords will bear the upfront costs - tenants will then pay a contribution to the costs through their rents, but will save money overall through lower fuel bills.

The retrofit project will act as a beacon for both investors and other social housing providers in demonstrating the vast potential for Green Deal investment in that sector.

By 2015 up to 100,000 Green Deal workers could be employed nationally in the effort to upgrade Britain's homes. Currently around 27,000 work in the insulation industry. Legislation to start the process of establishing the Green Deal is currently before Parliament. Improving the energy efficiency of homes will also make a large contribution to reducing carbon emissions - homes count for around a quarter of all UK emissions and the majority of people waste money through energy bills.

### Notes to editors

1. Ministers have announced a pioneering retrofit project with the Greater Manchester Housing Retrofit Programme, which will provide a model for investors and other social housing providers in demonstrating the vast potential for Green Deal investment in that sector.

2. Initially Salix Homes, as part of the Greater Manchester Housing Retrofit Programme, will develop the initiative as part of its current investment programme. The scheme will then be rolled out to up to 9,000 under the retrofit programme, which will prepare the way for Greater Manchester's 260,000 social homes to take up the Green Deal.

3. The scheme will provide valuable lessons for:

  * supporting local government and social housing providers in considering the potential of Green Deal as significant investment opportunity

  * increasing understanding of the development time and preparation needed to attract investment

  * developing the supply chain to deliver harder measures such as solid wall insulation, and prime the market to provide the coordinated installation services which will be necessary under Green Deal.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8 March 2011
http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1859816,Whitehall set to relax grip on councils with first ever review of local government's legal duties,"In another major step to free up local government, councils are being asked for the bureaucratic burdens they wish to throw away in the first ever central review of their statutory duties, Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark announced today.

Historically central government has been prescriptive about how councils should serve their communities and virtually every function councils undertake has a legal duty attached to it, set out in numerous Acts of Parliament.

To date no Government has ever assessed the cumulative burden imposed by the hundreds of legal duties placed on local government. Mr Clark believes that Government needs to be clear about the current demands placed on councils and decide which duties remain relevant to serving the public. The Review will proactively identify old and unnecessary burdens or barriers preventing councils from getting on with their job. However the Government will not remove statutory protections for vital frontline services such as libraries and child protection.

Today the Department of Communities and Local Government working with departments across Whitehall has published an initial list of more than 1,200 legal duties imposed mainly by primary legislation. Whilst many of these may be vital others are not and councils will themselves advise ministers of any duties missed at this stage, if any create unwanted burdens and which ones could potentially be repealed (see link, top right). 

The Coalition Government is determined to give councils the freedom and discretion they need to get things done without Whitehall red tape and regulation tying them down. The Review will start the process of simplifying legal requirements on local government while still protecting necessary safeguards and ensuring greater local transparency and accountability to local taxpayers.

Mr Clark said:

> ""Historically Whitehall has prescribed how councils should conduct their business. As a result hundreds of accumulated legal requirements have become attached to the functions councils undertake.
> 
> ""Until now no Government has comprehensively reviewed the relevance and worth of these legal duties to check if councils aren't being smothered by top down bureaucracy. That's why today we're asking councils to tell us which duties actually serve the public and which ones serve to create unnecessary burdens.
> 
> ""Rather than sending reams of paperwork to officials in Whitehall, councils need to be more accountable to their local residents. I am determined to release councils from the grip of Westminster micro-management by busting these bureaucratic barriers and burdens and letting them get on with their job. The transparency agenda will empower the local press and public to hold their local councils to account and ensure greater value for money over local spending. Government rules and regulations should be there to help councils deliver for the public - not stand in their way.""

The Localism Bill, currently going through Parliament, is already set to remove some of these duties. Ministers are committed to continuing to bust down the barriers that hinder councils and residents from managing their own lives.

The Government has already abolished thousands of central targets on local government, ended the costly inspection regime and announced work to streamline data requirements imposed on local government.

Ministers believe instead of streams of regulation and red tape pouring out of Whitehall, councils need to be freed to deliver local priorities. Mr Clark launched an online portal so councils, community groups, local institutions and individuals can highlight bureaucratic barriers stopping them from taking action they believe would improve their area: [http://barrierbusting.communities.gov.uk](http://barrierbusting.communities.gov.uk/).

#### Updated 16 March 2011 to clarify that duties on frontline services will be protected.

### Notes to editor

  1. Today the Government has announced the review of statutory duties which government departments place on local authorities. 16 departments and agencies of government are publishing their initial draft list of statutory duties for which their departments are responsible covering wide ranging and diverse interests such as housing, planning, crime and policing, adult social care, public health, equality, the environment and licensing - to highlight a few. The list is not exhaustive - it reflects mainly those duties imposed by primary legislation for which departments and their predecessors are responsible. DCLG's draft list has included statutory and non-statutory guidance that applies to the duties.
  2. For DCLG, for the time being, it also excludes duties stemming from Parts 1 and 2 of the Building Act 1984 as we are in the process of undertaking a separate review of these. There are also other reviews underway that are likely to impact on this work such as the Law Commission's review of adult social care.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1865652,Reforms to quangos will deliver millions in savings,"The Department for Communities and Local Government's plan to increase accountability by reducing and reforming its quangos is on course to deliver around £170 million savings Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said today.

To coincide with the Government's response to the Public Administration Select Committee's report, the Department is taking the opportunity to update on its own reforms for scaling back its Arms Length Bodies and reducing the running costs of those that remain.

DCLG is reducing the number of departmental Arms Length Bodies from twenty-six to nine. The remaining bodies are putting in place measures to increase efficiency including securing better value for money when buying goods and services and reducing running costs wherever possible. Taken together, it is anticipated that around £170 million will be saved from DCLG's budgets by 2014-15 with a further £60 million saved from the budget for Local Government spending.

Table: DCLG Budgets

Table: Local Government Budgets

Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""We are scaling back the quango state, increasing accountability over decision making and in the process saving the taxpayers hundreds of millions of pounds. By streamlining the layers of bureaucracy we will not only make government more effective but also more efficient.""

It has been estimated that the disbanding of the Audit Commission will save the taxpayer over £50 million a year. This will include saving the central and corporate costs of the Audit Commission, currently paid for by the Commission's fees including a surcharge on audits, including those by private firms. In addition, councils will be able to appoint their own independent external auditors from a more competitive and open market among audit firms, reducing costs.

In July last year the Department for Communities and Local Government announced the closure of the eight Government Offices for the regions across England. The measures are central to the Government's wider aims of transferring power from central government to councils and communities and the closure is expected to deliver savings of up to £200 million over the spending review period. These figures are in addition to the anticipated savings from the Arms Length Body reforms.

As well as changes to Departmental quangos DCLG is also committed to cutting out waste, reducing overheads and increasing efficiency at the centre.

The commitment to saving taxpayers money is supported by the monthly publishing of all spending over £500 online monthly. This is helping to ensure that both the Department and its quangos operate as transparently and economically as possible.

### Notes to editors

1. The Department is reducing the number of Arms Length Bodies from twenty-six to nine. Each body was considered individually with the Government considering the arguments in each case for retaining or abolishing the body.

2. The four Non Departmental Public Bodies wound up in 2010 were:

  * National Tenant Voice and the National Housing and Planning Advice Unit (these are both shown in the table as abolition will result in a saving over the spending period)
  * Advisory Panel on Standards for the Planning Inspectorate and Local Innovation Advisory Panel (which are not shown in the table as there are no costs or savings attached to these)(1).

None of the four required any legislation and were wound up by way of administrative action alone.

3. There are a further 12 bodies which we expect to be either abolished or transferred by April 2012. One body, the Leasehold Advisory Service remains under review which will report in April 2011.

4. The tables do not include the Audit Commission(1). The Government announced in August plans to disband the Audit Commission and move the work of its in-house audit practice into the private sector. The disbanding of the Commission will require legislation, which the Government will introduce at the earliest opportunity. Savings in the period to 2014-15 will depend on the timing of this legislation and the detail of the new local audit framework, on which we will shortly be consulting.

5. The Planning Inspectorate(1) is not included. As an Executive Agency, it is not within the scope of the Cabinet Office's Public Bodies Review and budgets are still in the process of being agreed.

6. Further detail on savings relating to individual Arms Length Bodies can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/documents/corporate/xls/1865595.xls](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/corporate/xls/1865595.xls) (MS Excel, 50 kb).

7. As part of a general drive to ensure value for taxpayers money, Ministers have also instructed all Department quangos to cancel their contracts with lobbying firms. This has resulted in Ordnance Survey and the Tenants Services Authority cancelling their contracts. The Audit Commission's lobbying contract ended in February 2010. Ministers believe that using taxpayers' funds on local government campaigns or to lobby government wastes public money as it gets used beyond the local area; public policy is weakened when conducted by private lobbying firms.

8. The Cabinet Office is today publishing, for the first time, estimates of the total savings achieved by the Government through the closure and reform of its public bodies. Detail can be found on the Cabinet Office website: [www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk](http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk) (external link).

9. These figures are estimates based on the administration budgets for running costs and restructuring for the Arms Length Bodies. They are subject to change as estimates on costs become firm. Calculation of savings follows HM Treasury guidance methodology and uses updated GDP Deflators post SR10 settlement. These savings figures are not directly comparable to savings figures from the SR10 announcement in October. These figures do not include potential pension crystallisation costs.

10. The Valuation Office Agency is an Executive Agency of HM Revenue and Customs. The funding in the table is provided by DCLG for work on Business Rates and Council Tax valuations.

(1) In addition to the bodies mentioned above, the remaining bodies not shown in the table are the self funding bodies - the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre; the Fire Service College; Ordnance Survey; the Architects Registration Board, and the Independent Housing Ombudsman.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1870382,Eric Pickles: 100 per cent council tax freeze protection delivered across the country,"Local people will get a much needed tax break with every English council taking up a Government offer to fund the first ever council tax freeze, Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles confirmed today.

With council tax more than doubling since 1997, Ministers were determined to protect hard-working families and pensioners on fixed incomes this year and set aside a £650 million funding pot to support councils willing to freeze or reduce their council tax.

Official statistics published today on council tax levels show the average Band D council tax set by Local Authorities in England will remain unchanged at £1,439 for 2011-12 as a result of a zero per cent increase on last year's council tax level.

This is the first time ever that 100 per cent of local authorities have reduced or frozen council tax since its introduction in 1993-94. 378 authorities have been able to freeze their council tax whilst 43 have opted to reduce it.

Despite immense pressures on the public purse the Coalition Government is committed to helping people struggling with their day-to-day bills keep the cost of living down as a result of the 100 per cent response to the Government's freeze initiative.

Eric Pickles, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, said:

> ""This Government has made sure that for the first time ever council tax bills have remained frozen all over the country this year - saving some local tax payers up to £72. We are standing up for the hard-pressed taxpayer who watched their council tax bill double.
> 
> ""Tackling public debt is our highest priority but we are determined to protect hard working families and pensioners who have been squeezed for too long. This is about giving real and immediate help to families struggling with the daily cost of living.
> 
> ""As well as special funding that has ensured councils freeze their bills, the Government has scrapped a council tax revaluation and in the future residents themselves will have the right to veto excessive increases in local referendums.""

Every eligible English local authority will now receive grant equivalent to them having increased their council tax by 2.5 per cent. This will be paid in ten equal instalments from April 2011. No further capping action is required in 2011-12.

The capping threshold in recent years was a 5 per cent council tax rise. Stopping such a rise this year saves a typical household up to £72 and if an average 2.5 per cent rise had occurred the saving would have been £36.

Every part of the public sector is playing its part as the country starts to pay back unprecedented levels public debt - including local government which accounts for a quarter of all public expenditure.

But Ministers have prioritised protecting the vulnerable and made the council tax freeze money available to protect hard pressed families and pensioners from rising tax bills at this critical time. In addition the Government has confirmed a fair and progressive funding settlement with new funding freedoms that will shield the most vulnerable and protect frontline services like rubbish collections and care for the elderly.

Moving forward, the Localism Bill makes provision to replace government capping powers with new, binding council tax referendums from 2012-13 where an authority is proposing an excessive increase. The Government has also protected families from potential increases in council tax bills by ruling out a council tax revaluation in England for the remainder of this Parliament. The Bill would also abolish bin taxes - which would have led to new charges for household waste collections for many families on top of council tax.

### Notes to editors

1. Council tax level statistics published today can be found at: [http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/statistics/counciltax201112](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/statistics/counciltax201112).

2. Although the council tax freeze is only for one year, financial provision is made to support the freeze across the Spending Review. This will avoid 'cliff-edge' effects of council tax soaring in future years, and will 'lock in' the benefits of this year's freeze over each year over the Spending Review.

3. In the future the public will be given the power to veto excessive council tax rises. Councils that set council tax increase above a set ceiling, approved by Parliament each year, would trigger an automatic referendum of all registered electors in their area: [http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1658293](http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1658293).

4. The Government also confirmed in September that there would be no council tax revaluation in England during the lifetime of this Parliament: [http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1723670](http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1723670).

5. The eligible authorities for the council tax freeze are local, police, and fire and rescue authorities - all these authorities have frozen or reduced their council tax. Parish councils are not covered, so bills in some areas may show small increases in cash terms due to parish precept increases.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1871038,Eric Pickles: Radical changes in housing and planning will drive local growth,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has welcomed measures to improve the planning system, action to get the house building industry building again and steps to cut the amount of red tape for councils and business set out in today's Budget.

The Department for Communities and Local Government is at the centre of the Coalition's plans to revive and rebalance the economy. Over the coming months the Communities Secretary will oversee a programme of work to unblock the planning system, boost house building and attract new investment into the market, maintain environmental and countryside protections. The reforms will put local councils, communities and local firms in the lead when it comes to delivering growth.

Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Eric Pickles said:

> ""The actions set out in today's Budget will create the conditions for growth and put this country back on a strong and stable economic footing. We are unblocking the complex, costly planning system, regenerating redundant sites and putting the brakes on the years of Whitehall micro-management that has tied business up in red tape, slowing and stifling growth.
> 
> ""The current planning system is bureaucratic, we will make it easier to navigate. We have a system plagued by conflict and appeals. We will establish a system where councils, communities and business work together. Instead of fighting against development imposed from Whitehall, local people will have a far greater influence over what is built in their area. We will maintain protection for the Green Belt and the environment - as we are committed to sustainable growth.
> 
> ""Every new home built will create jobs in the UK building industry. Before we took office house building had slumped to its lowest peacetime level since 1924. We are turning this around, providing support for first time buyers, encouraging private investment in housing, accelerating the release of public sector land and putting in place powerful new incentives that will give communities a share in the rewards of growth. Together, these measures to support local jobs and local firms will play a crucial part in the Government's wider work to get the economy back on its feet.""

To get Britain building again the Department for Communities and Local Government will:

  * Make up to £210 million available over the next two years to introduce a new FirstBuy scheme that will help over 10,000 first time buyers in England who are struggling to purchase a home in the market due to large deposit requirements. The FirstBuy scheme, jointly funded with house builders, will provide 20 per cent equity to top up first time buyers own deposit of 5 per cent, enabling buyers to access 75 per cent conventional mortgage.

  * Boost investment in house building, helping to reduce the sectors reliance on mortgage funding. The unfavourable Stamp Duty arrangements for bulk purchases of new build homes will end, making investment in house building more attractive, and tackling a tax distortion which currently favours individual purchases ahead of large scale investment.

  * Consult on proposals to increase housing supply by deregulating the planning system so it is easier for developers to change vacant offices into new homes.

To make sure the right land is available in the right place for development the Department will:

  * Accelerate the release of surplus public sector land supporting the creation of new homes and jobs. The Homes and Communities Agency will lead the way including making use of 'build now, pay later' schemes whereby house builders will be given surplus government land which they will only pay for once properties built on it are sold. The scheme will offer a lifeline to house builders struggling with cash flow problems. Other Government Departments and agencies will follow suit publishing land release programmes shortly and be held to account for the homes and jobs unlocked.
  * Reform the planning system through a range of measures, including the introduction of a powerful new presumption in favour of sustainable development. The answer to development and growth should wherever possible be 'yes', except where this would compromise the key sustainable development principles set out in national planning policy.
  * Remove centrally imposed, top down targets that have dictated levels of development on previously developed land. Present rules are overly prescriptive and have in some cases led to perverse outcomes - e.g. imbalances in provision between blocks of flats and family homes. Councils will be able to identify the most sustainable locations for growth in their areas, having regard to the coalition commitment to protect the environment, including maintaining the Green Belt and other environmental designations.
  * Pilot elements of the land auctions models, starting with public sector land. One of the biggest barriers to development is the shortage of land with planning permission. Auctioning parcels of land with planning permission has the potential to bring forward more land for development, increase competition in development and provide greater certainty for developers. The outcome of the pilot will inform further consideration of the wider land auctions model.
  * Place a new Duty to Cooperate on councils to work together to address planning issues that impact beyond local boundaries such as transport, housing or infrastructure.

To simplify and speed up the planning system and reduce regulatory and other burdens on the house building industry Government will:

  * Condense the near 900,000 words of unwieldy national planning policies into one concise, easy to use document. By the end of this year a new National Planning Policy Framework will set out the Governments key economic, social and environmental objectives and the planning policies to deliver them.
  * Consult on plans to simplify the planning process and streamline the information required to support planning applications. Reduce the complexity of the consents developers need. Introduce a planning guarantee that means that planning applications will not have to spend more than twelve months in total with decision makers, where a timely appeal is made.
  * Adopt a new, less costly zero carbon standard for all homes built after 2016. Central to the nation's commitment to slash carbon emissions, the new standards pave the way for the green transformation of Britain's homes, making them more efficient, warmer and cheaper to run.
  * Work with councils and developers to ensure that the cumulative impact of their local plans and other requirements do not unduly constrain the creation of much needed jobs and homes.

To rebalance the economy, reduce regulation and promote enterprise the Department for Communities and Local Government will:

  * Support the creation of the eleven new local Enterprise Zones announced by the Chancellor. These Zones will benefit from business rate incentives and planning freedoms as well as other deregulation. The Zones are intended to help kick start new investment and drive the creation of new private sector jobs in the local areas. The Department will also oversee a competition to identify the next ten zones that will be announced in the autumn.
  * Extend Small Business Rate Relief - the temporary one-year increase in Small Business Rate Relief which started last October will be extended for a further year (1 October 2011 - 30 September 2012). Helping small shops and businesses grow is a crucial part of rebalancing and rebuilding the economy. This tax break comes at the right time and offers a massive helping hand to small business.
  * Approve two redesigned regeneration projects which had become stalled due to the market downturn that will boost economic growth, and bring much needed new jobs. Originally suspended as part of the review of all spending decisions made since January 2010, the revised Sheffield retail quarter regeneration scheme now offers better value for money for the taxpayer (having secured greater support from the private sector) and is expected to deliver around 4000 net additional constructions jobs and around 1,600 permanent jobs. The wider central Milton Keynes sustainable residential quarter has been redesigned to make it more commercially viable and will deliver 400 homes without increased taxpayer expenditure.
  * Revoke the Two Tier Code in local government which formed part of the Best Value regime. Removing this guidance will make it easier small businesses and voluntary sector groups to succeed in the public service market by levelling the playing field and create more opportunities for innovation and greater economic and employment growth.

Taken together this is a comprehensive package for growth - continuing to deliver on the Government's commitment to get the housing market moving again and to putting councils, local businesses and communities back in the driving seat.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Demand for new homes is still growing, but last year house building slumped to its lowest peacetime level since 1924. This Budget shows we are serious about sorting this out - building more homes and increasing the pace of economic growth, and setting new standards for greener homes.
> 
> ""We've already given communities a reason to say yes to development through the New Homes Bonus, now we're helping house builders deliver the homes this country needs by taking away the upfront costs of buying land. We're also extending a helping hand to first time buyers, and 10,000 people will benefit will from help with their deposits so they can get a foot on the housing ladder.""

Decentralisation and Planning Minister Greg Clark said:

> ""The current over-centralised planning system has become one of the greatest obstacles to growth in Britain, shutting out opportunities for development and burdening business with bureaucracy and red tape. Every reform to planning in today's Budget is designed to reverse that position and recalibrate the system to support, rather than hinder economic growth and sustainable development. These measures will help create a planning system fit for the challenge of recovery and rebuilding Britain's economy, while at the same time maintaining our commitment to protect the Green Belt and environment.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1875618,Eric Pickles predicts public service shake up - as Community Budgets begin,"Local areas having a single pot of funding to spend on local problems are key to the future for public services and spending, Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said today.

Mr Pickles confirmed at a conference on Community Budgets today that the first 16 pioneers would be up and running come the 1st April 2011. The first Community Budgets pool and align various national and local funding strands into a single local funding pot for tackling social problems around families with complex needs.

The most troubled families can cost central and local agencies up to £330,000 a year. Children from these families are much more likely to excluded from school, taken into care or get into trouble with the police. Their parents are often affected by drug and alcohol problems, domestic violence and poor housing. The first 16 Community Budgets pilots will look to bring local agencies together to get straight to the heart of the problems facing some of the country's most chaotic families. They expect to help at least 10,000 families by 2015.

Mr Pickles said that communities need to be trusted with their own money to target their own problems. He confirmed that work would continue to develop bigger Community Budgets that cover more local public spending and more problems as part of the Coalition Government's plans to restore financial independence to local communities. The second phase of the Local Government Resource Review, commencing this month, will focus on broadening community budgets as they continue to be rolled out across the country.

Mr Pickles said:

> ""It's about time Whitehall started trusting local communities. And local agencies started trusting each other. What better way to make services work together than by putting all the money in one place? A single pot of local funding that can be targeted straight at the frontline.
> 
> ""Until now money from the centre has always come with strict caveats. At Whitehall we are going to step back and let local councils and agencies get re-animated about local problems. With Community Budgets we want to get as close as possible to the idea that councils and local areas should get a single pot of local funding from Government to spend as they see fit.
> 
> ""My message to local areas is don't be afraid to think big. To be as bold and as innovative as you can. This is the future for public services. If we can get 16 areas up and running in less than six months think what we can achieve moving forward.
> 
> ""I want all areas to be able to tackle problem families and other key local priorities through community budgets from 2013. For too long we've handed out pocket money to local agencies and told them how to spend like an overbearing parent. It's time to let local areas grow up and do things their way.""

Mr Pickles said the Government would continue to break down barriers and deliver the flexibilities local areas needed to deliver their ambitions. The first Community Budgets will be able to focus on all issues faced by families rather than treat each one in isolation by pooling local resources and know how. The council, local police, social services, Job centres, schools and housing groups will work together as one so families are no longer bounced between a myriad of programmes and professionals.

In the Islington pilot, where almost half of local children live in poverty, local agencies will pool over £6 million of resources and staff to provide intensive support. A new Family Outreach Support Service will be able to support a thousand families at any one time giving them one point of contact.

Swindon have already brought together professionals from the housing sector, the police, the NHS and adults' and children's services to work intensively with 12 families with persistent problems. They believe this work could save over £1.5 million in two years. Swindon's Community Budget now aims to reach 350 families by 2015 by increasing the reach of this programme.

This approach is part of the overall re-design of public services in Swindon as they plan to reduce costs by 26 per cent by 2014.

Ministers believe Community Budgets will help drive down overhead costs by removing the bureaucratic financial restrictions that have generated waste and duplication in public spending. Local areas will be able to redesign and integrate frontline services across organisations and share management functions to reduce running costs for the best local outcomes.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,29 March 2011
http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1876904,"Grant Shapps offers ""Build Now, Pay Later"" deal to developers","Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today offered developers a Build Now, Pay Later deal to get work started on thousands of new homes without facing the expense of buying the land upfront.

He published details of the first sites to be made available under Build Now, Pay Later, an innovative scheme designed to give a shot in the arm to housebuilders that have struggled to get their developments up and running.

Under Build Now, Pay Later, housebuilders pay for the land after they have started work on the new homes, offering a lifeline to those struggling with cash flow problems and enabling them to start building straight away.

Over the past decade, housebuilding slumped to its lowest levels for any peacetime year since 1924. Today, the Minister insisted that making this land available could offer a huge boost to the numbers of homes being built and jobs supported.

So Mr Shapps has announced moves by the first Government agency to bring some of its surplus land forward under this programme.

Today, the Homes and Communities Agency is leading the way, offering the first six sites for development, many of which will be possible under Build Now, Pay Later. These sites could lead to as many as 3,000 new homes being built and as many as 18,000 jobs in construction and related industries being supported.

Up to 40 per cent of land suitable for housing development - as much as 7,500 hectares - is ""sitting idle"" in public sector land banks. It is estimated that making this land available owned by central Government alone could help developers build more than 60,000 new homes over 10 years.

So to ensure these sites are the first of many to be made available, Government departments from across Whitehall will publish their own plans to release land - and will be held to account for the numbers of homes and jobs created as a result.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""Draconian top-down targets brought housebuilding to its knees, reaching the lowest level for any peacetime year since 1924. Radical reform is needed to give a boost to developers and kickstart building so we can get the homes this country needs.
> 
> ""Up to 40 per cent of the land ready for development in this country is simply sitting idle in the hands of the public sector. So today I'm giving the green light to the Homes and Communities Agency to lead the way by making six new sites available for development.
> 
> ""These will be the first of many sites as all Government departments will now be asked to make land available for housebuilding and, crucially, will be held accountable for the homes built and jobs supported through this. And many of these sites will be available under Build Now, Pay Later, giving builders access to land they only pay for once the homes are built and giving a boost to the level of housebuilding in this country.""

Pat Ritchie, chief executive at the Homes and Communities Agency, said:

> ""We are leading the way by making more land available for development through a range of options that will help developers get on site more quickly and help communities access the homes, amenities and public space needed in their local area.""

Speaking in advance of today's Home Builders Federation Policy conference, executive chairman Stewart Baseley said:

> ""The Government simply must address the acute housing supply crisis. The public sector owns around 40 per cent of potential residential land, and so moves to release surplus land for development are a positive step and we need to see the process quickly accelerated.""

### Notes to editors

The six sites being released by the Homes and Communities Agency are:

#### Hemel Hempsted

Planning consent is in place for 372 homes, known as Cherry Tree Lane, as part of the Spencer's Park development site - a site partly owned by Crown Estates. This phase of HCA-owned land will be brought forward for disposal and development by the Agency. The disposal will test Build Now, Pay Later options including payment for land on sale of homes or staged payments. This approach could trail the way for other HCA-owned land in the area.

#### Park Prewett, Basingstoke

David Wilson Homes has been announced as the preferred developer to work with the Homes and Communities Agency, Basingstoke and Dearne Borough Council and the local community to complete the final tranche on the redevelopment of a former hospital site, with up to 585 homes. The site will be delivered through the Build Now, Pay Later scheme.

#### Blackwall Reach, Tower Hamlets

Owned by Tower Hamlets Council, the development has been underway since 2007 with plans to demolish the 1960s Robin Hood Gardens housing estate currently on the site. The new plans include creating over 1,600 new homes, nearly 700 of which will be affordable. Construction work will involve a partnership between the Council, the Homes and Communities Agency and the developers Swan/Countryside, with the land sold under the new Build Now, Pay Later scheme.

#### Ransome Road, Northampton

The Homes and Communities Agency has brought together land owned by organisations including Northampton Borough Council and Network Rail to create a 23-hectare brownfield site close to the town centre, which is suitable for 450 homes, with plans for a further 800 homes once a new road link has been built. Working with organisations including the local councils and development corporation and the Environment Agency, the Homes and Communities Agency has made a number of improvements to the site to enable development, including improved road junctions and flood defences.

#### Cotgrave, Rushcliffe, Nottinghamshire

Plans include the development of a 4.6-hectare former colliery site being made available under Build Now Pay Later, with plans for 470 new homes and regeneration of the town centre. The land is owned by organisations including Rushcliffe Borough Council and the local Police Authority. The land will be available through Build Now, Pay Later.

#### Croppings, Lightmoor, Telford

Developers Keepmoat have been announced as the preferred developer of a site at Lightmoor Village, to build 100 new homes under Build Now, Pay Later. This is part of a wider development of the village - 230 new homes and a new primary school have already been built, as well as a new village centre. A further 370 new homes are expected over the next three years.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1878458,Sir Ian Magee to lead new Geographic Information Group,"The first chairman of a new high level group to oversee and provide advice to government on the public sector's requirements for Geographic Information, and how it should be sourced, has been appointed.

Sir Ian Magee will become chair of the Geographic Information Group from 1 April 2011. The Group will provide a high level of independence and expertise for specifying Government's customer requirements for geographic information, drawing on views and experience of users across the public sector, and from the wider industry.

A key function of the new Group is to act on behalf of all members of the new Public Sector Mapping Agreement which launches on 1 April 2011. The Agreement provides the entire public sector in England and Wales with access to Ordnance Survey data under a single agreement for the first time, all for free at the point of use.

This new agreement includes over 750 local and central government and NHS organisations with provision for thousands more to join. It will result in significant cost savings for the public sector, greater data sharing and widens access to geographical information.

The Mapping Agreement includes a broad range of Ordnance Survey data which underpins the provision of a number of vital public services - from calculating health inequalities and flood defence management to local refuse collection. In addition, the new agreement will stimulate new applications and websites that will help improve public services.

The Geographic Information Group will provide strategic direction for the Agreement. It is made up of senior representatives from across the public sector and will ensure the Agreement provides value for money and the data the public sector needs.

Sir Ian said:

> ""I am delighted to be the Group's first chairman and look forward to delivering on this important agenda. There is great potential here to bring about significant savings for the public sector from bringing this information together.
> 
> ""It is clear to me there are real opportunities for this Group to make a significant contribution to improving public sector efficiencies and driving innovation.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1879760,Grant Shapps calls on communities to decide how to spend the rewards of growth,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today called on councils to sit down with residents and decide how to spend the rewards of going for growth.

The Minister confirmed the first cash payments through the New Homes Bonus, totalling almost £200m for areas building new homes.

In a letter to council leaders, Mr Shapps said these powerful incentives have the power to transform housebuilding by encouraging local communities to support rather than resist development - but it is vital that residents now have the opportunity to choose how these building bonuses are spent.

Through the New Homes Bonus the Government will match the council tax raised from new homes for the first six years. The bonus available for an affordable home will be up to 36 per cent more than for a similar market home, equivalent to an extra £350 per house premium every year. Empty properties brought back into use will also receive the cash bonus for six years.

This means councils can receive payments of almost £9,000 on average for each band D home or almost £11,000 for an equivalent affordable home. So if an area increased the number of homes by 1,000 units this could earn a community almost £10m to spend as they see fit - which could deliver a much needed economic boost to their local area at a time when public finances are tight.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""The system where Whitehall told communities what homes they need to build never worked. Housebuilding declined for years, eventually slumping to its lowest peacetime level since 1924. The construction industry suffered terribly, and in many areas plans for new homes created a bitter legacy of divided communities and animosity towards developers.
> 
> ""This country needs more homes, so we need the nation to start building again - but this time with the backing of local communities rather than in the teeth of their opposition. That's why we're giving communities a reason to say yes to new homes through these powerful cash incentives.
> 
> ""But this funding from Government is only the start of the process - it is now essential that councils engage with their local community to decide how the money is spent, so residents feel the direct benefits of growth, rather than extra pressure on local services.""

Under the first cash payments for the scheme, 326 local authorities will receive a share of £200m for increasing the effective housing stock by almost 150,000 in 2010-11.

Communities themselves will decide how to spend this extra funding - whether council tax discounts for local residents, boosting frontline services like rubbish collection or providing local facilities like swimming pools and leisure centres.

### Notes to editors

  1. The New Homes Bonus is part of the Coalition Agreement and provides incentives for local authorities to deliver sustainable development, including for new homes and businesses. A consultation on the proposals was published on 12 November 2010. In February 2011 the Government published the Final Scheme Design for the New Homes Bonus and this can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/finalschemedesign](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/finalschemedesign).
  2. The long-term demand for housing is strong. Despite this, housing development has consistently fallen over the last decade. On average 26,000 fewer homes were built each year from 1997 to 2009, and in 2009 there were just 118,000 completions, the lowest level of house building in peacetime since 1924.
  3. The previous Government tried to remedy falling levels of housebuilding by using centrally determined housing targets that local authorities and communities had to meet. These failed to deliver the housing this country needs. The Housing and Planning Delivery Grant that was introduced to support targets and improve housing delivery was ineffective and complicated, and local authorities could not rely on it as a sufficient and stable incentive.
  4. A series of recent independent reviews by Sir Michael Lyons, Kate Barker and Professor Michael Ball highlighted the powerful role that local incentives could play in driving housing delivery. The current local government finance system does not provide the right incentive or rewards for councils to build new homes or bring long term empty properties back into use. If a local authority promotes the building of homes in the area it governs, little of the economic gain is captured by the local community. As a result existing residents see only further strain on public services and reduced amenity when new homes are built.
  5. The scheme will provide this incentive and return power back to local communities. Decisions on where and how development occurs will rest locally and ensure that the benefits of growth are returned to communities.
  6. £950m has been set aside over the Spending Review period to get the scheme up and running. In 2011-12 this is £200m and £250m in each of the remaining years. Funding beyond these levels will come from Formula Grant.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1881525,British Chambers of Commerce to lead local enterprise partnership network,"The British Chambers of Commerce, working with local business people all around the country, will bring together a new, national network for local enterprise partnerships, Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles announced today.

The new network will help ensure that businesses are the heart and soul of local enterprise partnerships. It will provide a forum for local business leaders to share ideas, solve problems and get the latest data they need to promote economic growth across the country.

The Government wants local areas to take control of their economic future. Local enterprise partnerships are locally-owned partnerships between business and civic leaders that decide local economic priorities and drive forward growth and job creation in their local communities, helping to rebalance the national economy.

David Frost, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce, has agreed to chair the new network. It will bring together a diverse range of local businesses, and will be inclusive of other business organisations, to tackle the big issues around local growth. The network will aim to encourage broad participation and private sector support within local enterprise partnerships in the months and years to come.

Mr Pickles also confirmed that Government will make some grant funding available to support the network during its start-up phase.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""The Government believes private sector led growth is the way ahead for the country and a business-led network for local enterprise partnerships can help deliver local growth that rebalances the national economy.
> 
> ""This will avoid unnecessary interference from Whitehall and repeating the bureaucratic legacy of Regional Development Agencies, but also means local enterprise partnerships can get off to a strong start.
> 
> ""British Chambers of Commerce came forward with a very strong proposal and with its existing business network across the country it is really well placed to anchor business at the centre of new local enterprise.""

Local enterprise partnerships have welcomed the new network today.

Andy Wood, chief executive of Adnams Plc and joint chairman of the New Anglia Local Enterprise Partnership, said:

> ""I welcome the Government's decision to support a local enterprise partnership network through the British Chambers of Commerce. It is important that areas work together to tackle common issues and share their experiences as we strive to create more private sector jobs and deliver sustainable economic growth.""

George Beveridge, the Cumbria Local Enterprise Partnership Interim Chair:

> ""This new network is great news and should provide real support to local enterprise partnerships across the country. I'm delighted that Chambers will be playing such a central role, ensuring that this initiative is truly led by business. Our local Chamber and other partners have played a key role in bringing our local enterprise partnership into being and continue to be immensely supportive. This augurs well for this new association.""

David Frost, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce, said:

> ""Business leaders across England have given their time and their energy to developing new local enterprise partnerships. This new network will give them the opportunity to share their experiences, solve some of the problems that come with new ways of working, and develop an even stronger understanding of how to grow their local economies.
> 
> ""Our priority now is to listen to local business leaders - this is their network. It will only succeed if it delivers a supportive forum to exchange ideas, a way to engage with Ministers, and the data and information that partnerships need to support local growth.
> 
> ""The British Chambers of Commerce is delighted to be at the heart of this network, and will work tirelessly to ensure that it helps enable enterprise growth across England.""

Business Minister Mark Prisk said:

> ""We are now close to full coverage of local enterprise partnerships across England, and it is important they have a forum independent of government where they can share knowledge and ideas, and develop their role in driving growth.
> 
> ""Businesses and local authorities have put a lot of hard work into setting up the partnerships. They will benefit hugely, not only from the grant funding which is being made available, but from working with the British Chambers of Commerce, who will help them access the guidance and contacts which will see partnerships thrive in their local communities.""

Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark added:

> ""Local enterprise partnerships now cover 91 per cent of businesses and 21 million employees across the country. Local chambers are already heavily involved in working with these new partnerships. I'm delighted the British Chambers of Commerce will now be bringing together a new national network to give local business leaders across the country a forum to share ideas and solve problems as these partnerships get off the ground.""

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6 April 2011
http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1885484,Action to boost support for voluntary sector and cut red tape for councils,"Communities Secretary, Eric Pickles, today announced a new fair deal for voluntary and community groups, wrapped up with cutting reams of red tape on local councils.

Mr Pickles is proposing a 'social responsibility' deal which will ask that councils give greater support for local community groups, including:

  * seeking to avoid disproportionate reductions in funding

  * giving at least three months' notice if they plan to reduce or end funding or other support

  * working with the organisation to shape the future of the service; and

  * speaking to the organisation and community about other ideas about how the service could be continued in a different, or more efficient, way

Central government departments will be signing up to the same principles.

This follows a call in a tough talking speech to the National Council for Voluntary Organisations in March when Mr Pickles challenged town halls to resist any temptation to 'pull up the drawbridge' and pass on disproportionate reductions in funding to the voluntary and community sector.

In order to reduce bureaucracy for councils Mr Pickles is scrapping 56 pages of statutory guidance on local priorities issued under the previous Government. The guidance spells out how councils should engage with the people in their area, how they should feed back information, and even a definition of what a 'local person' is. The change will remove barriers and burdens which Ministers believe currently forces councils to focus more on working to top down priorities than on serving their local communities.

Many councils are already working well with the voluntary and community sector. For example, Reading council is increasing the money it gives to voluntary groups, Worcestershire is publishing online all details about grant awards and payments to the voluntary and community sector to increase transparency, and Hampshire using 'microlots' to make it easier for small groups to bid for opportunities. The new 'Fair Deal for the Voluntary and Community Sector' will help ensure that all councils will give voluntary and community groups the opportunity to work together to provide services in new ways.

Mr Pickles said:

> ""The Government is reducing the burden of bureaucracy and removing red tape from councils, local firms and the voluntary sector.
> 
> ""I'm offering a social responsibility deal for town halls: I'm tearing up the unreasonable Whitehall red tape that costs them money and wastes their time. In return, local councils should treat local community groups with the full respect they deserve.
> 
> ""I'm not asking councils to do anything that I wouldn't do myself, so all central government departments are also signing up to these fair new standards.""

Sir Stuart Etherington, Chief Executive of National Council for Voluntary Organisations, said:

> ""This guidance is a welcome step forward, as it makes clear that councils need to avoid making disproportionate cuts to the sector and sets out what voluntary and community organisations should expect from working with local government. In the current climate, it is more important than ever that local authorities and voluntary and community organisations work together effectively, to ensure the best possible outcomes for individuals and communities.""

Sir Stephen Bubb, Chief Executive of the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations, said:

> ""It is essential to ensure the right actions are taken by some recalcitrant councils before irreversible damage is done to the voluntary sector in their area.
> 
> ""However we now need to move towards more positive engagement between councils and the sector, both at a local and a national level. We need a relationship where councils work in genuine partnership with the sector in order to reshape public services so that they deliver the best results for service users.""

Greg Clark, Decentralisation Minister, said:

> ""We are returning powers from central government to local authorities, but we expect councils in return to devolve downwards to voluntary and community groups.
> 
> ""We are determined not to decentralise in Government only to see local authorities centralise services in the town hall.""

### Notes to editors

1. The new best value guidance can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/bestvalueconsult](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/bestvalueconsult).

2. The current guidance being withdrawn is _Creating Strong, Safe and Prosperous Communities_. This contains 56 pages of guidance on a range of duties and associated issues around how local authorities should agree their priorities, engage their citizens, lead their communities and commission public services. Ministers also plan withdrawing two associated statutory duties. It follows withdrawal last month of other detailed guidance (21 pages) on workforce matters in local authority service contracts, such as terms and conditions of employment - this includes the 'two tier code'. Taken together, this will result in nearly 80 pages of central government guidance being withdrawn. The Local Government Association has called for the revocation of such guidance ([www.lga.gov.uk/lga/publications/publication-display.do?id=14334815](http://www.lga.gov.uk/lga/publications/publication-display.do?id=14334815) - external link).

3. The new guidance, taken together with measures such as Community Right to Challenge in the Localism Bill, reduce the barriers that often prevent voluntary organisations competing for local authority contracts. Both measures aim to promote local authority leadership in providing a level playing field for all, including local voluntary and community groups and social enterprises.

4. A number of local authorities are already working with the voluntary and community sector to deliver cost-effective, innovative public services. These include:

  * Gloucestershire will transfer more than 30 buildings or assets worth millions of pounds to communities across Gloucestershire in bid to make services more local. The Big Community Offer will include attractive peppercorn rents and up to 50 per cent asset share. The council will be offering one-off small grants from a pot of £50,000, which will be available to small groups to help kick-start their local projects. (Source: Gloucestershire County Council)

  * Hampshire is pursuing use of 'microlots' to make it easier for small and medium enterprises and the voluntary and community sector to bid for opportunities. For example, the Hampshire and Isle of White Small Project Framework small and medium enterprise builders was set up in 2007 in the Hampshire area for construction project with values between £25,000 and £500,000 and was made up of 15 small and medium enterprise builders. These frameworks have carried out over 220 projects in Hampshire with a total value of £25m, cashable savings £1.7m, helping them achieve average savings of 11 per cent. (Source: Hampshire Council)

  * Reading has set aside £100,000 to fund capital projects for the voluntary and community sector. All groups in Reading will be able to bid for a share of the money to help pay for their key projects. This new money is in addition to the £220,000 the council has confirmed this year to bring the Central Club back into community use, working in close collaboration with the Reading African and Caribbean Community Group. (Source: Reading Council)

  * Walsall is maintaining funding to the voluntary and community sector for this financial year, amounting to £6m annually. The council are exploring with local and national third sector organisations how they can develop a greater role in the delivery of vital services. (Source: Walsall Council).

  * Worcestershire is publishing all details about grant awards and payments under contract to the voluntary and community sector to increase transparency. Close involvement of communities is a key priority in planning for change. A pilot Community Model project is now underway which explores maximum potential for collocation of both statutory and voluntary sector services. (Source: Worcestershire Council)

7. Once published, the new Best Value Guidance will apply to all best value authorities, which are councils plus a range of other authorities including Police, Fire, Broads, Waste and Transport authorities. The full list is:

  * Local authorities (including county, district and Greater London Authority)
  * National Park authorities
  * Broads Authority
  * Police authorities
  * Fire authorities
  * Integrated Transport Authorities
  * London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority
  * Waste disposal authorities
  * Joint Waste Authorities
  * Transport for London
  * London Development Agency
  * economic prosperity boards
  * combined authorities

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,13 April 2011
http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1886026,Councils to publicise citizens' right to inspect town hall ledgers,"New transparency rules will require councils to publicise to the press and public the little-known rights to inspect councils' detailed financial accounts, ledgers and records. This is designed to increase scrutiny of councils' spending decisions by armchair auditors and local investigative journalists, Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said today.

Every year councils are required to open their accounting records for public inspection and challenge over a set time period. Yet the public often do not realise that these citizens' rights include checking not just the accounts but also ""all books, deeds, contracts, bills, vouchers and receipts related to them"". These rights allow the public to check any spending under the £500 online transparency threshold, and avoid the need to submit Freedom of Information Act requests.

Revised rules controlling local authority accounting and audit practice have been introduced reinforcing the importance of local transparency, audit openness and accountability. These inspection rights last for 20 working days, but the period differs for each local authority, resulting in a low take-up to date. So in addition to the existing requirement to notify the public of their rights through the local press, councils must now also highlight the opportunity on their website.

In a deregulatory move, changes will also reduce the financial bureaucracy and burdens imposed on the smallest local authorities, streamlining the audit process to make it easier for authorities to be accountable to their community.

Until now, any public body with a budget over £1m had to provide comprehensive accounting and audit details, which hit smaller authorities such as parish councils disproportionately. These budget thresholds have now risen to £6.5m, meaning that up to 100 smaller local bodies will immediately benefit from less burdensome audit requirements, reducing costs on reporting duties imposed by Whitehall.

Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""An open Government is vital for good democracy and that's why councils have to open their ledgers to the public - everyone has a right to know how their taxes are spent.
> 
> ""But it's not enough to just publish them quietly, armchair auditors and local journalists need to know exactly where to find that information and these new changes will make sure they are not just out in the open but under the spotlight too.
> 
> ""We have also cut the red tape for the smallest councils. For too long they have been hostage to the most complex demands from Whitehall, eating into time and resources they could have used to deliver for their community, whilst maintaining robust safeguards on the spending of public money.""

### Notes to editors

Case studies on the exercise of these rights can be found at: [www.orchardnews.com/casestudies.htm](http://www.orchardnews.com/casestudies.htm) (external link).

1. The revised Accounts and Audit (England) Regulations 2011 now include the following notification requirements:

  * the period during which the accounts and other documents will be available for inspection

  * the place at which, and the hours during which, they will be so available

  * the name and address of the auditor

  * the right to make objections at audit; and

  * the date appointed for the exercise of rights of electors.

As soon as reasonably possible after conclusion of an audit, a larger relevant body must give notice by advertisement and on its website stating that the audit has been concluded and that the statement of accounts is available for inspection by local government electors and including:

  * a statement of the rights conferred on local government electors
  * the address at which and the hours during which those rights may be exercised; and
  * details of where the statement of accounts can be found on the body's website

2. In addition the new rules raise the threshold below which a local body is classed as a smaller body from £1m to £6.5m annual income or expenditure. This is based on the definition of small companies in the Companies Act.

3. Changes to the regulations came into effect on 31 March 2011 meaning affected authorities can apply the changes to their 2010 - 2011 accounts due to be published shortly. The full regulations can be found at: [www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2011/817/contents/made](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2011/817/contents/made) (external link).

4. Any body which enjoys the freedoms given by the Prudential Capital Finance System is excluded from the smaller body category.

5. Smaller body status means that the body can prepare a simpler set of year end accounts, and is subject to a less demanding system of audit scrutiny. Those without websites are being encouraged to consider how else they can make their community more aware of their rights. Larger parish councils, internal drainage boards and joint committees of principal local authorities will be the main types of body affected by the change.

6. The procedure for councillors to approve the accounting statements of the larger bodies will also change to allow them sight of audit findings before they are asked to give their approval.

7. Enforcement of these regulations in the past has relied on audit review and civil law obligations, and this will continue in the future. Criminal sanctions have been removed, as they have not been invoked in recent years and since Coalition Ministers believe such criminal sanctions are disproportionate.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1893097,"Baroness Newlove joins the Department for Communities and Local Government to promote active, safer communities","The Government's champion for Active Safer Communities, Baroness Newlove, has joined the Department for Communities and Local Government to continue her campaign for a 'people power' revolution.

The Baroness will continue her work started at the Home Office and use the natural links the Department has with community groups, local government and partners with a 'call to action'. This will include acting as a champion for grassroot activists and working with ministers to raise awareness with local people, businesses and frontline workers on what they can do to make their communities safer.

Baroness Newlove published her report last month, _Our Vision for Safe and Active Communities_, detailing what residents, businesses, local agencies and central government can do to begin a generational shift in the country's approach to activism and tackling neighbourhood crime. The Government will be responding to the report over the summer, however many of the recommendations, such as more power for community activists, have strong links to the Localism Bill and the push to decentralise power away from Whitehall.

Baroness Newlove will also make her Maiden speech to the House of Lords today (Wednesday 27 April 2011) about her role and vision.

Baroness Newlove said:

> ""I am delighted my move into Communities (the home of barrier busting and cutting of useless red tape) will increase the pace of delivery of my plans for happier, safer neighbourhoods. This is the natural place for me to turn our joint vision into reality, and I am grateful for this opportunity to work across Whitehall too, as the voice for citizens.
> 
> ""I promised everyone who helped me with my report it would not gather dust, but it would be a roadmap for us to work towards our common goals which includes empowering local people to help find the solutions to local problems.
> 
> ""We have to let decision making and direction of resources be placed in the hands of those directly affected.
> 
> ""I look forward to meeting more community 'heroes' and developing  real, sustainable partnerships across government, agencies, charities  and more importantly 'ordinary' people, who act in extraordinary, and sometimes very brave and selfless ways to be good neighbours. And working with ministers to make it happen.""

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""It's great to have Baroness Newlove onboard to really drive the localism agenda at a grassroots level. She will bring invaluable insight and advice from communities that will ensure policies and new initiatives are relevant and useful for people instead of confusing Whitehall jargon. We look forward to working with her.""

Baroness Newlove will advise the Government on how to take forward her recommendations and develop further policy. Her role at the Department for Communities and Local Government will involve:

  * continuing her support for the seven activist areas that helped inform her report and recommendations
  * learning from people across the country who have helped make a difference in their area, and witnessing first-hand the very best of what works and what the barriers are to successful community activism
  * working closely with the Ministerial Team at the Department, and help them to develop policy that meets the needs of the unsung community activists who make such a difference on the ground
  * continuing her blog to directly communicate with activists and the wider public, sharing on-going learning from her visits, highlighting innovation and challenges and signposting people to useful resources
  * reporting back to ministers detailing how Government and local agencies can empower communities.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1894564,Grant Shapps: Government backs self-builders,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today announced that the Government will 'put its money where its mouth is' and help more people to realise their dream of building their own home.

Speaking at Grand Designs Live 2011, Mr Shapps said that he wanted self build to become a mainstream housing option - and that Government would play its part by making available publicly owned land for use by ordinary people to build their own homes.

As a group self-builders are already Britain's largest housebuilder, accounting for about one in five of Britain's new homes each year; but barriers and red tape have led to the UK having one of the lowest proportions of new homes built by self-builders in Europe.

Mr Shapps said he wanted to see more land being made available - both private and public - to enable more individual and community self build schemes. He called on private investors to bring forward plots, and for local authorities and Housing Associations to show their support.

The Minister said central Government would lead the way: he will shortly announce the first publicly-owned sites to be made available to housebuilders to include plots exclusively for self-builders.

This will be part of wider Government measures announced in the Budget to increase the amount of land made available for housebuilding, including to self-builders, which the Minister hopes will bring self-building into the mainstream and stop it being ""the preserve of the privileged few"".

It also forms part of Mr Shapps's drive to remove barriers and strip away bureaucracy which, he argues, have for too long thwarted the aspirations of people who want to build their own home.

In February he launched a new Industry-Government working group - led by the National Self-Build Association - to advise the Government on what action is needed to reduce barriers, including the burden of regulation and the lack of access to land and development finance.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""Self builders deliver affordable, greener and more innovatively-designed homes; and make a big contribution to the number of new homes built in this country, yet there is scope to significantly increase the number of self built homes in the UK - both for individual households and for community-driven projects.
> 
> ""I want to turn around the fortunes of self-builders by cutting the red tape and bureaucracy they often face and make self build a reality for many more people. I'm encouraged by the ongoing work of our self-build working group, which is making good progress in developing an action plan to reduce the barriers that aspiring self-builders often face. These efforts will help bring self-build into the mainstream, and not simply be the preserve of the privileged few.
> 
> ""And today, I can confirm that the Government will lead the way to promote more self build housing with plots available exclusively for self-builders on public sector land.
> 
> ""This will sit alongside the efforts we are already making to reduce the burden of regulation on the house building industry and through the Localism Bill to put power in the hands of communities up and down the country. We're enabling them to give the green light to new developments through the Community Right to Build, and simplifying the overly-bureaucratic planning system.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1897535,Grant Shapps: £30 million lifeline for families trapped in abandoned streets,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today announced a £30 million lifeline to families trapped in abandoned streets due to stalled large scale housing demolition schemes.

The Housing Market Renewal programme, launched in 2002, created large scale targets for demolition clearance and new build homes. Over time many of these schemes did not secure the public or private investment necessary, which Ministers argue resulted in blighted areas where large scale demolition and clearance projects were stopped in their tracks, often leaving isolated residents living in just a few homes in otherwise derelict areas.

The Coalition Government is committed to helping the most vulnerable communities which is why Mr Shapps has announced a £30 million contribution towards locally-led schemes that will deliver long term financially sound solutions to these outstanding regeneration hotspots and at the same time help people trapped in the worst of these abandoned streets.

Ministers believe the most acute problems are in five Housing Market Renewal areas - Merseyside, East Lancashire, North Staffordshire, Hull and Teesside. There are areas where the lowest quartile house prices in the renewal areas have remained well below the regional average and where surrounding housing markets are weak.

Local authorities in these areas are being asked to develop proposals that will help abandoned families and allow the local leaders to get regeneration back on track. £30 million Government funding will be available to support initiatives but local authorities will also be expected to match fund projects by harnessing their own resources such as the New Homes Bonus. Bidding guidance will be issued to local authorities in due course and proposals will then be assessed to ensure they deliver value for money for the taxpayer before Ministers approve final payments.

While on a visit to the Liverpool Housing Market Renewal programme Grant Shapps said:

> ""Despite the best efforts of local communities, the previous centrally controlled programme of large scale housing demolition hasn't worked. It pitched neighbour against neighbour and in some cases trapped families in abandoned streets.
> 
> ""This Coalition Government is committed to helping vulnerable people and will not stand by when residents are stranded in derelict neighbourhoods through no fault of their own. That is why today I am announcing a £30 million lifeline for these isolated families whose lives have been blighted by failed schemes.
> 
> ""Regeneration only works when it has the support of local communities. So I look forward to receiving innovative and financially sound proposals, backed by local people, that will finally transform the lives of people in these communities.""

### Notes to editors

1. The Government is allocating up to £30 million to develop a transition scheme intended to help people trapped in the worst conditions where Housing Market Renewal schemes have been stalled, for example where only a few homes remain occupied in a derelict street. This is part of the Coalition Government's aim to help the most vulnerable communities.

2. This will be a match funding scheme generating around £60 million in total to resolve the worst problems across the five most challenged Housing Market Renewal areas - Merseyside, East Lancashire, North Staffordshire, Hull and Teesside.

3. DCLG and the Homes and Communities Agency will shortly be publishing bidding guidance which will invite local authorities in the five most challenged Housing Market Renewal areas to develop proposals. Local authorities will need to harness their own resources such as New Homes Bonus. On the basis of 50 per cent match funding from these other sources this would allow a £60 million fund which will tackle the worst of the problems in these five areas.

4. The scheme will be run by the Homes and Communities Agency and work through local authorities. It will be a clean break with the previous Government's Housing Market Renewal programme and will not fund completion of old schemes or the buying out of old contracts.

5. Funding for this scheme is a maximum. Future regeneration projects in these areas will need to look to other sources.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1901708,More councils wanted to lead growth front-runners project,"More pioneering local authorities are being asked to come forward to demonstrate how the benefits of development can be shared directly with their communities and neighbourhoods, Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark announced today.

Last November, Mr Clark announced the Government's plans to reform the Community Infrastructure Levy - which has the potential to raise an estimated additional £1 billion a year of funding by 2016 to support growth locally - and invited local authorities to apply to become part of the Front Runners' project to develop the best approach to implementing the Levy in their area.

The first phase of the project is now underway and in response to the high demand from councils, local authorities are now being offered places to take part in a second phase.

Each front-runner will have access to a tailored package of support from the Planning Advisory Service to help them set a charge for their area, which is likely to include group workshops, good practice advice, and lessons learned from the first local authorities to implement the Levy.

Reforming the Community Infrastructure Levy is part of the Government's commitment to radically reform the planning system and gives local authorities more choice and flexibility in how they fund infrastructure that they, their local communities and neighbourhoods want.

The levy will have a positive economic effect upon development in a local area, unlocking land for growth and providing developers with much more certainty 'up front' about how much money they will be expected to contribute, which in turn will encourage greater confidence and higher levels of inward investment.

Greg Clark said:

> ""More and more local authorities are showing enthusiasm for introducing a reformed Community Infrastructure Levy, to help ensure the rewards of growth are felt at a neighbourhood level.
> 
> ""We are now looking for a further group of pioneering authorities that are not only committed to introducing the levy in their local area, but are also keen to demonstrate how the levy will act as an incentive to support growth and development.""

### Notes to editors

1. To ensure all those who have an interest in the levy and who might be involved in its operation fully understand its key features, its rationale, purpose and how it will work in practice, two new information documents about the levy will shortly be released - one on collection and enforcement and another on reliefs and exemptions - alongside a revised version of the Department[s Community Infrastructure Levy overview. The overview document is available at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/communityinfrastructurelevymay11](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/communityinfrastructurelevymay11).

The Community Infrastructure Levy Information Documents on Reliefs and Exemption and Collection and Enforcement will be released shortly.

2. On 18 November 2010 Greg Clark announced the Government's plans to reform the Community Infrastructure Levy. The Community Infrastructure Levy was first introduced by the previous Government in April 2010. It allows local authorities in England and Wales to raise funds from developers undertaking new building projects in their area. The money can be used to fund a wide range of infrastructure that is needed as a result of development.

3. All local planning authorities that had previously applied to become a Community Infrastructure Levy Front Runner will be automatically submitted for consideration for Phase 2 of the project, but local authorities are strongly encouraged to submit an updated application that fits the amended selection criteria.

4. The Planning Advisory Service provides consultancy and peer support, learning events and online resources to help local authorities understand and respond to planning reform.

5. Further information about the application process can be found on the Department's website here: [www.communities.gov.uk/planningandbuilding/planningsystem/communityinfrastructurelevy/cilfrontrunners/](http://www.communities.gov.uk/planningandbuilding/planningsystem/communityinfrastructurelevy/cilfrontrunners/).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1904028,Grant Shapps: Housing our heroes,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today met with leading industry figures and defence officials to discuss what more can be done to help people serving in the military get a roof over their head and a foot on the property ladder.

Mr Shapps said it is right that the brave men and women who give their all to protect our country get more assistance to find a decent home to live in - whether they are still serving or returning to life on civvy street.

![](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1904174)

Invitations were sent to key house builders, councils, lenders, defence officials and services' charities to attend the summit, for a candid and open discussion about all the issues, including:

  * a new commitment to offer priority for service personnel under the Government's FirstBuy scheme
  * tackling the barriers which can disadvantage Service or ex-Service personnel in securing a mortgage, such as difficulty with credit scoring because of service overseas or living on army bases without standard postcodes
  * working with councils to encourage fairer treatment for military personnel applying to live in social housing
  * ensuring national planning rules are flexible enough to allow disabled ex-servicemen to have homes that suit their needs
  * working better across Government and with charities to tackle homelessness amongst ex-service personnel
  * looking at how service personnel could benefit from other initiatives to help first time buyers, including privately funded shared equity schemes that cushion the cost of buying a home
  * exploring what specific actions might be needed to enable more ex-service personnel to bring forward self-build housing projects; and
  * working with the Ministry of Defence to ensure surplus land they release for development can be used for housing that benefits ex-service personnel.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""The brave men and women who serve in our military are heroes, who everyday make a commitment that is well beyond just coming to work and doing a job. And yet often they are the very people who struggle to get a roof over their head or fulfil their aspiration of buying their own home.
> 
> ""This is wrong, and we will not stand idly by and deny decent homes to the people who deserve them the most. That's why I'm calling together key figures from across industry and the military to discuss how we can tackle this problem.
> 
> ""This is not about charity - it's about duty, our duty as a nation to serve those who have put their lives on the line for the benefit of the entire country. Members of our armed forces don't want our sympathy or a hand out, just a chance. They have answered the call of duty, and now we must hear their call.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1905496,Grant Shapps sets out practical solution to cut emissions from new homes,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today announced a tough but realistic definition for zero carbon homes that strikes the right balance between delivering the zero carbon homes for the future and creating the right conditions to get the homes the country needs built.

The Government's proposals for the Zero Carbon Homes standard - the standard to which all new homes started after 2016 must be built - will set tough new standards to ensure that new homes do not add to the country's carbon footprint.

Mr Shapps said that he rejected calls to make housebuilders anticipate the lifetime emissions of each property because it was not reasonable, and other measures are in place to reduce the carbon emissions from the actual use of houses. He said that ""they should not be responsible for the amount of television the families who buy their homes watch or the number of cups of tea they make each day"".

Instead, tough standards for fabric energy efficiency (insulation, glazing) will be included in future changes to the Building Regulations.

Mr Shapps also said that the Government will consult on the independent Zero Carbon Hub's recommendations on the levels for other on site carbon reduction levels, which might require renewable energy technologies to be used like solar panels. And he will confirm that a proposed regime for off-site measures like community energy schemes which deliver genuinely additional carbon savings would be introduced.

Key aspects of this will be to design a regime which will:

  * be made available to all developers operating in England;
  * be cost effective by ensuring offsite measures are no higher than the Government's long term value of carbon; and
  * ensure that any funds raised will be dedicated to carbon abatement.

The Government will also review the measures which can be supported under these approaches and will consult further with industry, local government and other partners on these.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""We have delivered on our commitment to nail down a definition for zero carbon homes. This is an historic turning point in our drive to slash carbon emissions and tackle climate change. It paves the way for the green transformation of Britain's homes - making them warmer and more comfortable to live in, and at the same time cheaper to run.
> 
> ""And we have done this without piling unfair costs on housebuilders. The new definition will balance increased costs of house building with the social commitment we made to reduce our country's carbon footprint.
> 
> ""This approach is fairer and reaffirms the Government's commitment to reduce regulatory and other burdens on the house-building industry by March 2015. It also plays an important part in protecting the economic stability of the country.""

Housebuilders will now only be responsible for emissions from homes themselves, as covered by Building Regulations, so they will need to take action to ensure that the emissions associated with the energy use from heating, lighting, hot water and building services are reduced to zero.

Carbon savings will be made beyond the bricks and mortar, by building homes both with renewable energy technologies on site, such as solar power, and through off-site measures such as local community energy schemes. All new homes started after 2016 will be built to this standard, so housebuilders can now start working towards this date. The independent Zero Carbon Hub has established a series of work streams to address implementation.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1909927,Baroness Hanham visits regeneration projects in Cornwall,"Communities Minister Baroness Hanham visited Camborne, Truro, Redruth, Pool and Newquay (18 May 2011) to see how vital regeneration cash is boosting skills and helping small businesses to realise their full potential.

Supported by central and local government, the European Regional Development Funding has allocated over £400 million to Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly to support investment in activity that will help to transform the area's economy by helping businesses to realise potential whether that be through skills development, provision of specialist premises, links to research or low carbon measures.

Amongst the innovative projects that Baroness Hanham visited were:![Baroness Hanham meets a blind man at The Elms, Cornwall](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1909915)

 

  * The Elms, Redruth, a voluntary, community and social enterprise centre. Disadvantaged, young people and the community are supported and coached back into work, through learning skills for life, capacity building, and community learning, and outreach. The £1,027,000 funding will support smaller voluntary sector organisations including Cornwall Neighbourhoods for Change, Redruth Community Radio and Cornwall Community Volunteer Services for the Visually Impaired.
  * Fifteen Cornwall, Watergate Bay, a pioneering social enterprise developed by Jamie Oliver to train young apprentices in restaurant skills, and which celebrated it's fifth birthday, 18 May 2011. £565,000 funding has helped towards the build cost, with 60 people graduating from the programme to date.

![Baroness Hanham with an apprentice at Fifteen Cornwall](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1909918)

Other ways in which the fund helps Cornwall and the Scilly Isles are:

  * Broadband roll-out - providing super-fast connections to small and rural businesses so that they can help economic recovery. With the introduction of the superfast broadband, local businesses will have the opportunity to expand and be more innovative.
  * Heartland project - Transforming former mining land back into use, providing space for the community and restoring heritage facilities, due to be completed later this year.
  * Builds on investment from previous programmes in the Eden Project, art galleries such as the Tate in St Ives and Combined Universities for Cornwall.

Communities Minister, Baroness Hanham said:

> ""This funding will have a big impact in Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly, supporting people, regenerating communities and helping local businesses to flourish.
> 
> ""We need the small businesses and the private sector to lead our economic recovery and I want Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly to share in and lead that growth. Whether it's helping rural business through superfast broadband, or boosting tourism and helping our agricultural businesses to thrive.
> 
> ""I would also like to congratulate Fifteen Cornwall, as it enters its sixth year of giving young people the opportunity to develop skills in the restaurant industry.""

The Government is currently exploring how in addition to European Regional Development Funding we can use Local Enterprise Partnerships who have specific local knowledge to provide their expertise in business support and cultivate innovation in local communities.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1912920,Eric Pickles urges bank holiday vigilance against planning cheats,"Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles is today reminding councils to be alert over the bank holiday weekend so no one can break planning laws and expect to get away with it.

Mr Pickles said that councils should be ready to use their powers and act against unauthorised development over the extended weekend, ensuring the system for retrospective planning applications is not abused. He also pledged to strengthen the existing powers that councils have to halt developments that are breaching planning laws.

Current powers available to councils include Temporary Stop Notices, which can mean that activities that breach planning control must stop immediately, with offenders facing a fine of up to £20,000 if they fail to comply. The Government is currently considering options to strengthen the hand of councils to use these powers to tackle unauthorised developments.

This follows a number of cases where people have put in a planning application over a bank holiday weekend, and used that time to develop land illegally whilst council offices are closed and officers unavailable to take action to stop it. The delay means that by the time the application is assessed and enforcement action taken, development can already have occurred - for example laying concrete driveways or cutting down protected trees.

Mr Pickles urged councils to have planning officers on call, ready to deal with last minute applications and take rapid enforcement action against any unauthorised development.

Vigilance against abuse of the planning system will help reduce the volume of retrospective planning applications, which are expensive for the taxpayer, put an unnecessary strain on the planning system and are not fair to the vast majority of people who play by the rules.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""For years, dodgy developments have been thrown up on bank holiday weekends when planning departments are closed, leaving them with a major headache when they come back to work.
> 
> ""It's wrong that a small minority of planning cheats can play the system in this way, leaving councils with months, and sometimes years, of hassle to get rid of developments that shouldn't be there. Unauthorised developments have also created tensions between travellers and the settled population. We want to redress the balance and put fairness back into communities.
> 
> ""That's why I'm calling on councils to take precautionary measures and make sure that they have planning officers ready to deal with any planning applications submitted over the weekend. But we also want to help councils ensure there is fair play in the planning system, so we are looking at strengthening Temporary Stop Notices to toughen up councils' existing powers to tackle unauthorised development.""

Additional measures are being introduced through the Localism Bill to limit opportunities for retrospective planning permission in relation to any form of unauthorised development, and to increase the powers that local authorities have to enforce against breaches of planning control. In the meantime Ministers are urging councils to remain vigilant against breaches of planning rules, and use the existing powers at their disposal.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1914100,"Positive reaction to new powers brings more communities eager to bring growth, jobs and homes to their neighbourhood","Dozens more communities eager to test radical new rights that will give local people much greater ability to bring growth and shape development in their area, were announced by Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark today.

40 communities - a mix of cities, urban and rural areas - are to join 50 other communities already trialling neighbourhood planning a powerful new right being introduced in the Localism Bill. The positive reaction to the first wave of communities announced last month and developing neighbourhood plans has led to many more communities coming forward.

Neighbourhood planning is a key reform designed to create the conditions for communities to welcome growth by giving local people a real voice in deciding the look and feel of development in their area; from determining the locations of shops, offices and schools to setting standards of design for new housing.

Local people will for the first time be able to decide the types of development given automatic planning permission through a Neighbourhood Development Order. If approved by a local referendum, a council will need to adopt a neighbourhood plan providing it is line with wider ambitions for growth in their area.

Neighbourhood planning complements reforms announced in the Budget to ensure the planning system does everything possible to support economic growth and sustainable development. These measures include allowing communities to share directly in the benefits of growth through the New Homes Bonus.

Greg Clark said:

> ""For too long people have felt alienated from the planning process and had little influence over changes to their area. Neighbourhood planning will help reverse that by putting communities at the heart of shaping developing in their area.
> 
> ""The large number of communities, eager to trial neighbourhood planning proves that localism and growth do go hand in hand. By giving local people a greater say and incentives to benefit from growth, communities will start to welcome development rather than resist it.""

The 40 neighbourhood planning front-runners will be led by Local Authorities who will work with community groups and parish councils to prepare draft plans and Neighbourhood Development Orders.

Each of the 40 areas will receive £20,000 towards developing their plan from a £5 million fund set up to help those communities eager to trial neighbourhood planning in 2011/12.

Applications are also being invited from other communities eager to trial neighbourhood planning as part of the fourth wave of frontrunners. Further details can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/planningandbuilding/planningsystem/neighbourhoodplanningvanguards/](http://www.communities.gov.uk/planningandbuilding/planningsystem/neighbourhoodplanningvanguards/).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1915772,Wiltshire flag flies above Whitehall,"The flag representing the historic county of Wiltshire has been hoisted above the offices of the Department for Communities and Local Government.

![Wiltshire flag](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1918159.jpg)Wiltshire flag flying outside DCLG

To celebrate the important place counties play in the nation's cultural heritage Secretary of State Eric Pickles has asked that English county standards be flown alongside the Union Flag outside the Department's Eland House headquarters in Victoria.

Characterised by its high downland and wide valleys, Wiltshire is home to the famous Salisbury Plain and the location of the UNESCO-listed Stonehenge as well as the Avebury stone circles and other ancient landmarks. It is also the main training area in the UK of the British Army.

Locals, nicknamed moonrakers from an apocryphal tale of alcohol smuggling, reside in a county famous for its Neolithic history and in Salisbury Cathedral possess not only one of the finest examples of Early-English architecture but also Britain's tallest church spire.

The flag of Wiltshire features the local Great Bustard bird which has been recently re-introduced to the Salisbury plain. It is partly based on the flag of the Wiltshire Council, including the alternating stripes of green and white that represent the grassy downs of the county and their chalk underlay.

Flags are being flown for a week at a time in alphabetical order or - in cases such as Cornwall and Yorkshire - to coincide with particular county days.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""England's counties continue to form an important part of our cultural and local identity in this country and many people remain deeply attached to their home county. This sense of pride and shared identity is one of the things that binds communities together.
> 
> ""The historic English counties are one of the oldest forms of local government in Western Europe. Their roots run deep. And no amount of administrative reshuffling can delete these longstanding and cherished local identities.""

Mr John Bush, OBE, KStJ, HM Lord Lieutenant of Wiltshire, said:

> ""I am delighted the government has introduced this initiative, which gives a visible sign of public service provision to the electorate. Wiltshire is an historic county which contains many wonderful attractions from Stonehenge and Salisbury Cathedral to Avebury and Wootton Bassett.
> 
> ""There is a wide diversity of agriculture, military activity and commerce across the county, with many major companies centred in Swindon, providing a rich commercial and cultural mix. Residents are proud of their county and I feel privileged to be Her Majesty's Lord Lieutenant in such a beautiful part of England.""

Jane Scott, Leader of Wiltshire Council said:

> ""Wiltshire is a beautiful county and this is a proud moment for us all. The flying of this flag will help promote Wiltshire and its identity.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1917730,"Government plans release of public land to build 100,000 homes","Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today announced Government plans to release enough public land to build as many as 100,000 new, much-needed homes and support as many as 25,000 jobs by 2015.

The amount of previously-developed land owned by the public sector is more than twice the size of Leicester.

So the Minister today confirmed that by this Autumn, every Government department with significant landbanks will publish plans to release thousands of acres of previously-developed land to housebuilders, so they can get on and build the homes the country needs - supporting thousands of jobs and releasing funds to help in the vital work of bringing down the Budget deficit.

To make this radical ambition a reality by 2015 the Public Expenditure Committee, a Cabinet Committee chaired by Francis Maude, will go through each department's plans with a fine tooth comb, to make sure every possible site is made available for housebuilding.

Alongside this, property specialists from across Government will work with each department and challenge them to release as much land as they can for new homes.

Ministers are also encouraging councils to follow the lead set by central Government and make their unused land available for development.

Later this year, a new map will be launched to show land and buildings owned by public bodies in each area. A new Community Right to Reclaim Land has been introduced enabling residents to apply to organisations including central Government departments and councils to bring their sites back into use - opening up the books so local people can see for themselves the assets held by central and local Government alike.

Grant Shapps also outlined his own department's contribution, as the Homes and Communities Agency publishes its plans to release more land for redevelopment. This includes through a radical Build Now, Pay Later deal, which offers a boost to housebuilders who only pay for the land once work has started on the new homes - providing a lifeline to those struggling with cashflow problems, and enabling them to start building straight away.

Publicly owned sites such as the following have been, and are being, made available for new housing developments across the country:

  * **Fairmile, Oxfordshire** - A 40-hectare former hospital site owned by the Homes and Communities Agency, beside the river Thames in Cholsey, Oxfordshire. Fairmile is being transformed with the creation of 354 new homes including refurbished houses and apartments within the retained Grade II hospital buildings. There will be a mix of commercial, community and leisure facilities as well as landscaped grounds that will be made accessible to the public. The first new homes are due to be completed by developer Linden Homes this month and it is expected that the whole scheme will be complete by 2014. This will also serve as an early pilot for 'Build Now, Pay Later'.
  * **New Covent Garden Market** - a 57 acre site, in Vauxhall, South London, will be redeveloped at no cost to tax payers to provide a new modern market, 2300 apartments, a hotel, shops, a major grocery store and community facilities including a food industry training suite. The market hosts 200 businesses with more than 2500 people employed on the site, the largest single employment site in Wandsworth. New Covent Garden Market is part of the Nine Elms Opportunity area which includes Battersea Power Station and the future home of the American Embassy. To provide additional transport links for the area, which when completed will include 16,000 homes including affordable housing, the developers are funding London Underground's Northern Line Extension. Covent Garden Market's redevelopment project includes the start of the new Green Linear park which will link the Nine Elms Opportunity area and provide additional outdoor and community space for Londoners and visitors; and
  * **Bath** - The rationalisation of office accommodation owned by the Ministry of Defence will free up sites in Bath, which will be brought forward for disposal over the next few years. Subject to planning, the sites have the potential for around 1000 new homes. Bath and North East Somerset's Core Strategy is going to Enquiry in Public in September 2011 and it is anticipated that the Inspector's report is due in spring 2012.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""As one of the country's biggest landlords, the Government has a critical role to play in making sites available for developers so we can get the homes this country needs built.
> 
> ""So today, I can confirm an ambitious challenge across Government to release enough land from Whitehall's grip for 100,000 new homes across the country. Over the coming months, property specialists will work to make sure no stone is left unturned and no site is left unused, and every department's plans will come under the close scrutiny of a Cabinet committee.
> 
> ""The work starts today, with sites already being brought forward by three different departments, including my own, some of which will be available on new terms so developers can start building straight away. So we are already off to a flying start - it is now for developers to come forward, make the most of this unique opportunity, and help contribute to our country-wide efforts to help get the homes this country needs built.""

Chief Secretary to Treasury Danny Alexander said:

> ""This is a double dose of good news, creating and sustaining thousands of jobs by boosting housebuilders while also creating thousands of new homes for people to live in. Getting the economy growing is the Government's top priority and this move, combined with other measures set out in the Plan for Growth to ease planning restrictions, are a key part of helping the private sector led recovery.""

Mark Clare, Chief Executive of Barratt Developments PLC, said:

> ""This is a big step in the right direction. The rapid release of publicly owned land has the potential to be an effective catalyst for increasing the supply of land for new homes in this country during the next few years.""
> 
> ""Barratt has an established track record of working with public sector partners to build out important sites and deliver desperately needed new homes. We are already working on a number of Build Now Pay Later sites with the public sector and, in the wake of today's announcement, will be looking at ways to expand and deepen that partnership.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1922478,Andrew Stunell: New green revolution needed to cut carbon emissions from existing buildings,"Andrew Stunell has today insisted that carbon reduction measures must be taken to ""green-up"" the country's existing housing stock to reduce its carbon footprint and save households considerable sums of money on their energy bills.

Speaking at the Policy Exchange, the Minister said that around three quarters of the housing stock that will exist in 2050 has already been built, making it vital to tackle emissions from existing buildings, as well as new build properties, to meet the country's tough carbon reduction targets.

Buildings account for over 40 per cent of the UK's CO2 emissions - a figure that needs to fall to almost zero by 2050, which is the equivalent to refurbishing a city the size of Cambridge every month.

Mr. Stunell said that the Government is putting in place a package of measures to enable a step change in domestic retrofit activity that will cut carbon and stimulate jobs and growth, but that Whitehall alone cannot deliver the necessary improvements. He argued that power must be shifted down to local people, businesses and community groups and empower them to shape their environment and promote local economic growth.

The Green Deal which will become available in 2012 will help householders improve the energy efficiency of their homes at no upfront cost. By allowing them to pay for green home improvements over time rather than upfront, through the savings in energy bills, it will remove one of the biggest barriers they currently face to retrofitting - being able to afford the initial investment.

Feed-in Tariffs are available to support homes in generating their own renewable electricity, and support for renewable heat will be available for homes. Looking to the future, the Government's policy on Zero Carbon means that from 2016, new homes will need to be built to a zero carbon standard (and all non-domestic buildings from 2019).

Andrew Stunell said:

> ""Buildings are responsible for over 40 per cent of the carbon emissions we produce each year. If we are serious about a revolution in the energy efficiency of homes, it is vital that we ensure that existing as well as new homes have significantly lower carbon emissions.
> 
> ""A strong programme of retrofitting will green-up our existing homes through the Green Deal, part of our clear strategy for delivering not only more homes, but crucially more sustainable housing.
> 
> ""We need a green revolution in housing that transforms our homes and becomes the central pillar in meeting our commitments to slashing carbon emissions. The Government will put in place measures to help households green their houses - but industry and community need to step up to the plate and deliver them.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1924848,New powers will put faith groups at the centre of their communities - Eric Pickles,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles today urged faith groups to make use of new powers in the Government's Localism Bill to end their reliance on the goodwill of local authorities alone, and strengthen their arm in playing an active and visible role in society.

Speaking to the Cinnamon Network - a faith-based charities group - the Secretary of State outlined the Government's continued financial support and commitment to faith groups. He acknowledged that faith groups - often engaged in vital work within communities - can face barriers in terms of securing funding from local authorities and endless unnecessary red tape.

Mr Pickles argued that a misplaced suspicion of faith groups risks society missing out on opportunities to make the most of their enthusiasm and expertise, whilst health and safety zealots pushing rules and red tape beyond the realms of taking care of people makes it unnecessarily hard for people to play their part.

He used the speech to outline how this Government is committed to giving faith groups new powers and freedoms to act in their communities, from the running of public services to taking over much-loved local assets. He also pledged to help to overcome red tape and petty regulation that stands in their way of getting further involved in local life.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""In the eyes of some, being religious is seen as being 'weird'. They don't want public discussion about faith, and don't want faith to have a role in our communities. Everyone - whether religious or secular - loses out from that kind of attitude.
> 
> ""We need to ensure that all our faith groups have every opportunity to make their mark. To restore some common sense, give them new powers and freedoms, and remove the over-the-top bureaucracy and red tape that stands in their way. So we are changing the balance putting faith groups on surer footing with new rights to have a say and to challenge that will open the door for faith groups to get further involved in local life.""

The Localism Bill - currently going through The House of Lords - includes two key measures that place power in the hands of local charities and local people giving them a greater say over what happens in their area.

First under the Community Right to Challenge community, voluntary sector and faith groups with bright ideas on how services could be better run will be given new powers to challenge and take over local services, such as meals on wheels, or homelessness support. Second, under the Community Right to Buy they will be given greater opportunities to have a fair chance to take over, save or transform local buildings. This could see for example a run-down village hall transformed into a centre for social enterprise.

Ministers have also set out a reasonable set of expectations of how local authorities should behave towards faith, voluntary and community groups. They have made clear that whilst councils have challenging decisions to make around their spending priorities they should avoid passing on disproportionate cuts to the voluntary sector. Charities and volunteers should be included in local debates about future services and should be given at least three months' notice when councils decide to end grants or payments under contract.

### Notes to editors

1. Set up in October 2010, the Cinnamon Network is a group of over 40 Chief Executive Officers of faith-based charities developing responses to the Government's Big Society agenda.

2. The Government continues to recognise the importance of faith organisations to local communities. Earlier this year, £5m was awarded to the Church Urban Fund for the 'Near Neighbours' programme, £5,000 each for small-scale, grass-roots projects designed to bring people of different backgrounds together.

3. Research commissioned by the Cinnamon Network shows that almost 70 per cent of Churches plan to increase their social action initiatives this year.

4. Putting a monetary value on the contribution faiths make is not easy, but the Cinnamon Network commissioned research reveals that churches and their congregations contribute significant time as well as monies to their communities. The 284 churches involved in the sample delivered a total of 439,000 hours of volunteer service in the last 212 months, which equates to 1,925 per church on average; These churches contributed £1,234,000 to finance social action work, or £7,568 per church, spent on an average of 3.3 projects; Projecting these figures against population and church going for the UK gives an estimate of 72 million hours of volunteering for Church-led initiatives over 12 months.The Cinnamon Network research into the Church's current involvement in local social action, is available at [www.brin.ac.uk/news/?tag=cinnamon-network](http://www.brin.ac.uk/news/?tag=cinnamon-network) (external link).

5. The Localism Bill includes new rights for local communities, including the Community Right to Buy and the Community Right to Challenge. The Government has consulted on both rights and will be responding shortly.

6. Those faith groups who are finding it hard to get things done because of excessive red tape, rules and regulations can get in touch with Communities and Local Government through our 'barrier busting' website at [http://barrierbusting.communities.gov.uk/](http://barrierbusting.communities.gov.uk/) (external link).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1926863,Grant Shapps: New scheme to offer first-time buyers an alternative to the Bank of Mum and Dad,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today encouraged aspiring first-time buyers across the country, to come forward for new Government help to get a foot on the property ladder.

The Minister launched the new FirstBuy scheme, specifically designed to help those struggling to buy their first home due to the need for large deposits.

He confirmed that over 100 housebuilders will take part by offering their new-build homes to first-time buyers.

Through FirstBuy, the Government and housebuilders together will offer a 20 per cent equity loan, which alongside a five per cent deposit from the buyer will enable them to take out a 75 per cent mortgage on the rest of the property.

Loans will be repaid on resale of the property, with the Government's share available for reinvestment in more affordable housing. The first homes are expected to come on stream in September this year.

FirstBuy will help over 10,000 first time buyers in England over the next two years, with up to £500 million being available across the UK.

And because the scheme is only available on new-build properties, it will offer a much-needed shot in the arm to the housing market and the construction industry - supporting thousands of jobs.

Subject to contracts signed over the summer, housebuilders that will be able to offer homes for sale through FirstBuy will include:

  * Persimmon Homes
  * Barratt Homes
  * Bovis Homes Limited
  * CM Yuill Limited
  * Galliford Try Homes
  * Morris Homes Limited
  * Radian
  * The Miller Group Limited; and
  * Taylor Wimpey

Key lenders are also backing FirstBuy by preparing to offer 75 per cent mortgages to those first-time buyers making the most of the scheme.

They include:

  * Halifax
  * Nationwide
  * Barclays; and
  * The Melton Mowbray Building Society.

And today, Mr Shapps called on those looking to buy their first home to contact their local HomeBuy Agent to register their interest in the scheme. To find your local agent, visit: [www.homebuy.co.uk](http://www.homebuy.co.uk/).

Grant Shapps said:

> ""With 80 per cent of young first-time buyers depending on parental help, I am determined that we pull out all the stops to help those who want to take their first steps onto the property ladder.
> 
> ""FirstBuy will do just that - a Government-backed scheme making £500 million available to offer a valuable alternative to the Bank of Mum and Dad. Over the next two years, this will help as many as 10,000 people in England to get that much-needed deposit together and realise their dreams of owning their own home.
> 
> ""And because this help will be available on newly-built properties, it will also offer a much-needed boost to our housebuilding industry, supporting thousands of jobs across the country.""

Stewart Baseley, executive chairman of the Housebuilders Federation, said:

> ""Firstbuy will help first time buyers, boost economic growth and provide a vital shot in the arm for the house-building industry. Our members have reacted decisively to support FirstBuy and recognise the scheme is an important first step.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1931361,Grant Shapps sends special agents into barracks to help our troops buy homes,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today announced special housing agents will be sent into military bases to help members of the armed forces get a foot on the housing ladder.

Housing agents will be dispatched to barracks across the country and abroad to help troops apply to buy a home under the £500m FirstBuy scheme, which will help over 10,000 households purchase a new build home over the next two years.

On the national day to celebrate the work of our armed forces, Mr Shapps confirmed military personnel will be the top priority to benefit from the nationwide scheme, and called on developers to also visit army bases and market their new build homes to the troops.

The move follows a military housing summit chaired by the Minister, where industry leaders and defence officials discussed what more can be done to help people serving in the military get a roof over their head and a place of their own.

Such was the appetite for helping military personnel buy their own homes that Mr Shapps immediately moved them to the top priority category for assistance through FirstBuy. Serving members of the Armed Forces, as well as those recently retired, will now be at the front of the queue to benefit from the scheme.

The Government is taking further steps to ensure that all Government-funded home ownership schemes routinely place members of the Armed Forces at the top of their priority lists.

Mr Shapps also signalled that prioritising military personnel will be extended to social housing. Rather than being forced to languish on waiting lists, service families in need of a social home should be given higher priority by councils.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""It's not enough to simply tell the troops they are a priority for the FirstBuy scheme and wish them luck. I want to make sure that military personnel have the best opportunity to benefit. That's why I am dispatching special housing agents to military bases and training camps as recruiting sergeants for the scheme, and we are encouraging developers to do the same. Troops will be told how they can benefit, and how they can apply to buy one of the thousands of new homes that will be made available over the next two years.
> 
> ""This Government believes in helping people who deserve it - none more so than the brave men and women who put their lives on the line to protect our country. Our troops don't just want to hear a few kind words on Armed Forces Day - they want action. That's why I have promoted members of the armed forces so they will be the first to benefit from the Government's scheme to help people get a foot on the housing ladder.
> 
> ""The help for our heroes will not end there. Steps are being taken to make sure members of the armed forces are at the top of priority lists for all Government-funded home ownership schemes. We will also end unfair treatment of military personnel applying for social housing. No longer will the loyal service of our troops be rewarded with an extended period of languishing on council waiting lists. Instead, service families in need of a social home will be given proper priority, and will be treated with the dignity and respect that their selfless sacrifice deserves.""

Mike Farley, chief executive of Persimmon plc, commented:

> ""It is important that we give our Armed Forces a helping hand onto the property ladder. We are delighted to be able to support more than 2,100 troops and other first time buyers in the purchase of their new homes right across the country thanks to the government funding in the FirstBuy Scheme.""

Starting next month, developers will begin marketing homes under FirstBuy and qualifying households will be helped with a 20 per cent equity loan to buy a property from a participating house builder.

This comes in addition to work between the Government, credit agencies and Royal Mail to ensure that those living on a base or serving abroad are not disadvantaged when applying for a mortgage.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1933153,Surrey flag flies above Whitehall,"The flag representing the historic county of Surrey has been hoisted above the offices of the Department for Communities and Local Government as part of the Department's celebration of county identity.

To celebrate the important place counties play in the nation's cultural heritage Secretary of State Eric Pickles has asked that English county standards be flown alongside the Union Flag outside the Department's Eland House headquarters in Victoria.

The name Surrey is Saxon meaning ""South Ridge"" though later the name of the area was Sudergeona or ""southern"". Little remains of the Roman or the Saxon periods in Surrey. However there is an Iron Age hillfort at Holmbury Hill and remnants of the Roman roads Stane Street and Ermine Street.

The title of Earl of Surrey was awarded at the signing of the Great Charter (Magna Carta) at Runnymede, Surrey in 1215, in recognition of the county's loyalty during the rebellion that followed the death of William I of England.

Surrey is one of the most affluent and successful counties in the UK. It is home to such corporations as Toyota and Pfizer as well as famous sporting venues such as Epsom race course and Brooklands racing circuit.

Flags are being flown for a week at a time in alphabetical order or - in cases such as Sussex and Yorkshire - to coincide with particular county days.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""England's counties continue to form an important part of our cultural and local identity in this country and many people remain deeply attached to their home county. This sense of pride and shared identity is one of the things that binds communities together.
> 
> ""The historic English counties are one of the oldest forms of local government in Western Europe. Their roots run deep. And no amount of administrative reshuffling can delete these longstanding and cherished local identities.""

The Leader of Surrey County Council, Dr Andrew Povey, said:

> ""I am very proud that the Department for Communities and Local Government has chosen to fly Surrey's flag from it headquarters this week.
> 
> ""Surrey plays a central role in the wellbeing of our country, both financially and socially, so I see this as recognition of the hard work of our residents.
> 
> ""It is also fitting that this week we will be discussing the exciting future that lies ahead for local government at the Local Government Association annual conference.
> 
> ""Our close working relationship with the Department for Communities and Local Government means we are at a crossroads which promises to provide local government with freedoms that will benefit our communities for years to come.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1937784,Localism is key to improved resilience says Fire Minister Bob Neill,"Bob Neill has announced next steps after the consultation on the future of fire and rescue control centres throughout England. This follows the cancellation of the FiReControl project which aimed to replace 46 local control centres with nine regional centres.

In total, 61 submissions were received from the public consultation exercise, mainly from fire and rescue authorities and services and suppliers in the fire and rescue industry.

A broad consensus emerged from the responses, especially around the Government's preferred approach of increased collaboration. The Government's commitment not to impose any central solution was particularly welcomed.

Fire Minister Bob Neill said:

> ""First I would like to thank all those who responded to the consultation, and the valuable contribution made by the Chief Fire Officers Association and the Local Government Group to our next steps. The great majority of those responding to the consultation agreed with the Government's preferred approach of achieving improved resilience and efficiency through encouraging increased collaboration in a locally-determined way - with some Government support. Our strategy for the future is to build national resilience through local solutions.
> 
> ""I have today announced that total funding of £81million will be made available to England's Fire and Rescue Authorities to help them develop their own solutions for improving resilience and efficiency - as a guide, that's up to £1.8million each. More may be available where plans offer exceptional benefits but within the £81million total. A further £1.8million will support cross cutting initiatives that enhance resilience and efficiency, such as the development of common standards.""

Securing national resilience and ensuring public safety against national risks is the primary focus of central Government in its ongoing relationship with the Fire and Rescue Services. The Department will work with the sector to develop and consult on a new National Framework. This will define national and local resilience roles, including issues arising in the context of cross-border working interoperability, and multi-agency interoperability. Discussions will include considering a national communications capability and standards for data exchange.

### Notes to Editors:

  1. On 20 December 2010, Fire Minister Bob Neill MP announced the termination of the main IT contract and closure of the FiReControl project. The project began in 2004, following a short consultation, and had aimed to replace England's 46 standalone fire and rescue control rooms with a national network of nine resilient control centres. The contract was terminated because the contractor EADS Defence and Security (now trading as Cassidian) Ltd could not meet the requirements of the project within an acceptable timeframe.
  2. Fire and Rescue Authorities have a statutory duty to respond to emergency fire and rescue calls and mobilise appropriate resources to incidents under the Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004. Throughout the project Fire and Rescue Authorities continued to be funded via traditional funding streams to maintain and replace their control room systems in order to fulfil their statutory duty. The FiReControl project was included in the Fire and Rescue Service National Framework 2008-11.
  3. The Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) consulted on the future of fire and rescue control services in England from 13 January to 8 April 2011.
  4. The consultation document can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/fire/fireandrescuecontrolservices](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/fire/fireandrescuecontrolservices) and the response document at [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/fire/controlservicessummaryresponses](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/fire/controlservicessummaryresponses).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1937920,Grant Shapps calls for more 'mates mortgages' to help struggling first time buyers,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps will today call on lenders to offer 'mates mortgages' so younger first time buyers can club together and take their first step on the property ladder.

With [new research](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/publicattitudeshousing) published today showing 86 per cent of people want to buy a home, Mr Shapps wants lenders to make it easier for friends who would like to buy a house and can afford the repayments, but are locked out the market by the requirement for a large individual deposit.

For groups of friends without access to the Bank of Mum and Dad, mates mortgages could become a mainstream alternative to years of saving, as well as providing a welcome boost to the housing market.

The Minister wants more lenders to offer straightforward mortgage products such as Britannia's 'Share to Buy', so increasing the number of these schemes that facilitate joint ownership will be the top item for discussion when he meets key housing and mortgage industry figures for a second First Time Buyers Summit.

He will also urge lenders to replicate a new 'First Time Buyers Pledge' by Lloyd's. Under the pledge more advice and assistance will be available to prospective homeowners, including a personal action plan for unsuccessful applicants setting out how they could be successful in the future, and a promise that failed applications will not affect the credit rating of first time buyers.

The summit been arranged by Mr Shapps to review progress since he made a rallying call to the housing industry earlier this year to step their efforts and help more prospective first time buyers fulfil their dream of buying their own home.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""I'm delighted that progress has been made since the first summit I called to help first time buyers. More mortgage products are now available, and lenders, housebuilders and councils are cooperating better with each other to offer a range of options to prospective homeowners.
> 
> ""But much more still needs to be done. 'Mates mortgages' are one option I would like to see explored. If there are mates who are perfectly capable of paying monthly mortgage payments but are struggling to fund a deposit on their own, there should be straightforward options to unite with their friends and take the first step onto the housing ladder together.

> ""That's why I have once again called on key figures from across the housing market to come together and discuss ways to improve the availability of mortgages, and how existing products can be promoted much better.
> 
> ""I also want to discuss how the improved service being offered to first time buyers by Lloyd's can be replicated across the sector. Eight out of ten aspiring homeowners under 30 can't get on the ladder without help from the Bank of Mum and Dad. So it is vital that every option to increase the availability of mortgages is pursued, so we don't lock a generation of young people out of the housing market.""

Mr Shapps welcomed the improvements that have been made since the first summit. This includes:

  * a range of new and innovative products developed jointly between lenders and housebuilders to offer mortgages on new build homes;
  * a growing number of local schemes providing local authority backed mortgages through Lloyds Local Lend a Hand;
  * a new Government FirstBuy scheme, specifically designed to help those struggling to buy their first home due to the need for large deposits, especially those in the military; and
  * better communication within the sector - a new website for lenders, housing associations, house builders and the public to promote joint working on affordable solutions including shared ownership and equity loans.

### Notes to editors

1. New mortgage products that help first time buyers have become available this year. This includes the Hitachi loan deal with Barratts Homes, and mortgage guarantee scheme launched by Taylor Wimpey.

2. A new local mortgage product - Lloyd's Local Lend a Hand - has become available since the first summit in February this year. Prospective first time buyers will now be able to apply for council-backed mortgages through the scheme in areas across the country including Warrington, Northumberland, Orkney and Peterborough. Further schemes will become available later in the year.

3. Grant Shapps is calling for more mortgage products that help friends club together to buy a home - existing products include Share to Buy by Britannia.

4. The Lloyd's banking group launched their First Time Buyer Pledge on 31 May 2011.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1940278,The Audit Commission - Appointment of new commissioners,"Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles has today announced that Sir David Williams has been appointed to the Audit Commission Board, as the Government presses ahead with the disbandment of the Commission and transferring the work of its audit practice to private firms. Options are being considered for this transfer, that include the possibility of a bid from an in-house mutual.

Sir David joins as the Liberal Democrat representative on the Board and brings considerable knowledge and experience which should assist the Commission during this period of change.

Eric Pickles the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government said:

> ""I am pleased to announce the appointment of Sir David Williams. He brings significant practical public sector knowledge to the Board. His previous experience of the Audit Commission will assist them through this period of change.""

The Communities Secretary Eric Pickles announced in August 2010 plans to disband the Commission and refocus audit on helping local people hold councils and local public bodies to account for local spending decisions.

Subject to Parliament enacting the necessary legislation, local audits will be regulated within a statutory framework overseen by the National Audit Office and the profession. Councils will appoint their own independent external auditors and there will be new audit arrangements for local health bodies.

The work of the Audit Commission's in-house audit practice, which is the fifth largest audit practice in the country, will be transferred out of public ownership after 2012.

### Notes to editors

1. Sir David Williams has been a member for Richmond Upon Thames since 1974, and was Leader of the Council from 1983 to 2001. Sir David served as Chair to the Local Government Association between 1996 to 2001, and sat on the Audit Commission Board from 1997 to 2003.

2. The appointments and extension will cover the period from 11 July 2011 to 31 December 2012. The Commissioners will be paid £14,358 per annum based on a time commitment of 3 days per month.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1941309,Eric Pickles - Armchair auditors are here to stay,"Greater local financial control must go hand in hand with greater willingness to open accounts to local scrutiny, Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles has said.  
   
Speaking to an audience of Local Government finance professionals, Mr Pickles emphasised the essential role financial transparency has played in eliminating waste and inefficiency to deliver value for money to the taxpayer and help protect services.

Mr Pickles signalled the next wave of Government transparency would be for councils to publish details of all contracts and tenders over £500 online. This follows the publication of spending over £500 online.  
   
The Secretary of State said a new wave of local scrutiny by citizen journalists, microbloggers and armchair auditors - what he labelled his 'citizen samizdat' - was a triumph and encouraged councils to welcome them into the world of local government finance.

He reminded councils he intends to publish a list of when all council ledgers are opened to the public. Under law councils are required to hold a financial open day. He thanked finance officers that had already given the Department their dates.

Mr Pickles went on to argue that with central controls over council finances being relinquished greater transparency must be the spur to greater competition and efficiency in spending, which can help avoid incidents like those that took place in Barnet and Islington:

  * In Barnet serious deficiencies in procurement arrangements saw the council spend over £1m of taxpayers' money to hire a private security firm with no tendering exercise, contract or proper invoicing. It was uncovered by local armchair auditors and activist bloggers
  * In Islington an independent audit of thirty of the council's top five hundred suppliers found that many invoices had been paid more than once.

Mr Pickles said: 

> ""Live blogging from council meetings, micro-journalism, call it what you like - it's here to stay. In fact this citizen samizdat - local people reporting on their local council's triumphs and shortcomings - is the perfect counterblast to town hall Pravdas.
> 
> ""The next wave of transparency after publishing spending over £500, will be councils publishing contracts and tenders over £500 online as well. An online list of council contracts will prevent a repeat of the likes of Islington or Barnet, and will spur on greater competition and efficiency.
> 
> ""And it doesn't just strengthen the hand of citizens. It strengthens the hand of rank and file councillors, letting them know what officials are doing on their behalf.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1942372,Warwickshire flag to fly at Department for Communities and Local Government,"The flag representing the historic county of Warwickshire has been hoisted outside the offices of the Department for Communities and Local Government.

To celebrate the important place counties play in the nation's cultural heritage Secretary of State Eric Pickles has asked that English county standards be flown alongside the Union Flag outside the Department's Eland House headquarters in Victoria.

Warwickshire is rich with history, and has played an important role during England's timeline - be this during the age of the Roman Empire, the English Civil War or in the Gunpowder Plot of 1605.

Probably the most famous Warwickshire person of all, William Shakespeare was born in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1564, and is now regarded as a literary genius whose creative achievement has never been surpassed in any age.

In the sporting sphere the modern Rugby rules and practice, although developed by a number of institutions across Great Britain, first originated in Rugby School in Rugby, Warwickshire.

The flag of Warwickshire depicts a bear and ragged staff. The origins of these emblems are lost in the distant past, but have been associated with the earls of Warwick since at least as early as the 14th century. William Dugdale, writing in the 1650s, said that Arthgal, an Earl of Warwick at the time of King Arthur, thought that his name came from the Welsh ""artos"" or bear. He also suggested that the ragged staff was chosen because Morvidus, Earl of Warwick, killed a giant with the broken branch of a tree. Of course, neither of these earls really existed and Dugdale was just recalling medieval legends. The bear was a common heraldic device and implied boldness and courage.

Flags are being flown for a week at a time in alphabetical order or - in cases such as Cornwall and Yorkshire - to coincide with particular county days.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""England's counties continue to form an important part of our cultural and local identity in this country and many people remain deeply attached to their home county. This sense of pride and shared identity is one of the things that binds communities together.
> 
> ""The historic English counties are one of the oldest forms of local government in Western Europe. Their roots run deep. And no amount of administrative reshuffling can delete these longstanding and cherished local identities.""

Cllr Alan Farnell, Leader of Warwickshire County Council, said:

> ""We are fortunate to live in such a beautiful part of the country with many picturesque towns and villages including Shakespeare's Stratford, historic Warwick and its fine castle, and Rugby, where sport famously originated.
> 
> ""Warwickshire has a rich history and we are justly proud of our county and its emblem, the bear and ragged staff, which dates back to the 14th century. I am actually in London this week on county council business and will hopefully get chance to see the ceremonial flag flying outside Whitehall for myself.""

Lord Lieutenant Martin Dunne added:

> ""It is a tremendous honour to have our standard flown as part of the Department for Communities' celebration of our national culture and heritage. The Warwickshire bear is the symbol which helps give us a sense of identity and bonds our communities together, so we are thrilled that it will be in the skies of the capital alongside the Union Flag.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1950704,Armchair auditors should act on their rights to inspect Town Hall books,"A new online [search engine](http://local.direct.gov.uk/LDGRedirect/index.jsp?LGSL=1584&LGIL=8) launched today shows local taxpayers when they can inspect their council's detailed financial spending and ledgers as part of greater public transparency, Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles announced today.

Every council is required by law to make its accounts available to the public for 20 days a year. This includes every invoice, payment and receipt registered in the council's ledgers. It applies to all expenditure, not just amounts over £500.

To help residents and armchair auditors to find out when they have a right to inspect, an online search engine has been published setting out the open day period for over 280 councils. Ministers have said they would like to see all councils sign up to the catalogue. Accounting rules have already been amended to require councils to publicise these little known rights to inspect.

For the majority of taxpayers the window of opportunity to see these documents is open now or due to begin shortly. Mr Pickles is urging citizens not to miss out on the chance to view their council's and fire and rescue authorities books.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""Transparency is the foundation for a strong local democracy. It strengthens the hand of citizens by opening up the processes that show where their council tax goes. It helps councils do more for less, protect frontline services and save taxpayers' money.
> 
> ""For the next few weeks, Town Hall ledgers across the country are open to the scrutiny of armchair auditors. Every concerned citizen should use this opportunity to dig into the intricacies of their council's coffers.""

Every council, except, Nottingham City Council, now routinely publishes its spending over £500 online. Mr Pickles added:

> ""These rights complement online transparency. It is disappointing that one local authority is still failing to publish its spending online. I urge the press and public to exercise their legal rights to inspect Nottingham's books on the day they make their accounts available.""

**Notes to editors**

1. To find out when they can check the accounts at their council, residents can simply enter their postcode, town or council name into the search engine to find their councils details. They can choose from the options for entering your details and click 'Go'. Alternatively they can search through a map function. This service is only available in England and is dependent on local authorities registering with the local directgov team: [http://local.direct.gov.uk/LDGRedirect/index.jsp?LGSL=1584&LGIL=8](http://local.direct.gov.uk/LDGRedirect/index.jsp?LGSL=1584&LGIL=8) (external link).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1950740,Changes to the Audit Commission Board,"A process to appoint a new member of the Audit Commission board has been launched today. Merrick Cockell's appointment to the Audit Commission Board will come to an end as he leaves to join the Local Government Association.

The appointment of a new Commissioner is now needed so that the Board remains quorate and to ensure that a local government representative from each of the main political parties can play a part in the management of the Commission. The recruitment process for a new Conservative member has commenced, in co-operation with the Local Government Association.

The Government announced plans in August 2010 to disband the Audit Commission and to refocus audit on helping local people hold councils and local public bodies to account for local spending decisions. In the future, councils will be free to appoint their own independent external auditors from a more competitive and open market and there will be a new audit framework for local health bodies. This will save council taxpayers' money and decentralise power.

The new Board member will assist with the process of closing the Commission down, shaping its reduced role during the current transitional period and transferring the work of its widely respected audit practice to the private sector.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1951731,Dramatic simplification of planning guidance to encourage sustainable growth,"A new, simpler framework for the planning system that safeguards the environment while meeting the need for sustainable growth has been published for consultation today by Planning Minister Greg Clark.

National planning policy, which is the basis for every local plan and decision, has accumulated to over one thousand pages during the last decade. Its volume and complexity have made planning increasingly inaccessible to all but specialists.

The Government in the Coalition Agreement committed to turning this thicket of national planning policy into a clear, tightly focused document, setting out national priorities and rules.

Today Ministers are inviting views on the draft _National Planning Policy Framework_ - which streamlines national policy from over 1,000 pages to just 52 pages of policy - as part of a consultation to get the planning system right for current and future generations. The draft Framework draws on responses to an initial call for evidence earlier in the year. The Government intends to consult on simplifying other guidance on national policy as the next step.

Underpinning the draft Framework are powerful protections for communities to safeguard the natural and historic environment. It maintains the Government's commitment to protecting the green belt, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and Sites of Special Scientific Interest; facilitates a new generation of renewable energy projects; paves the way for green transport of the future - the electric car - by encouraging decision makers to provide charging points; re-affirms protections for our nation's historic and cultural heritage, and for our wildlife and bio-diversity, including new protection for peat bogs; and helps tackle the light pollution affecting the beauty of the night sky.

In addition, the draft Framework delivers on the Government's commitment in the _Natural Environment White Paper_ to allow communities to earmark important local green spaces for special protection - whether its value is in its natural beauty, its historical resonances, its recreational value, its tranquillity or its richness in wildlife.

The draft Framework also underlines the need for councils to work closely with communities and businesses and actively seek opportunities for sustainable growth to rebuild the economy; helping to deliver the homes, jobs, and infrastructure needed for a growing population whilst protecting the environment. A presumption in favour of sustainable development means that proposals should be approved promptly unless they would compromise the key sustainable development principles set out in the draft Framework.

Greg Clark said:

> ""Clarity in planning has become lost in translation. National planning policy and central government guidance has become so bloated that it now contains more words than the complete works of Shakespeare, making it impenetrable to ordinary people.
> 
> ""We need a simpler, swifter system that is easier to understand and where you don't need to pay for a lawyer to navigate your way around. That's why we promised reform to make planning easier to understand and easier to use for everyone.
> 
> ""Today's proposals set out national planning policy more concisely, and in doing so make clearer the importance of planning to safeguarding our extraordinary environment and meeting the needs of communities, now and in the future.
> 
> ""We now want to hear the thoughts of councils, communities and businesses on the draft Framework and work together to get the planning system right for generations to come.""

Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman said:

> ""Our Natural Environment White Paper set out how we will not only continue to protect our countryside and green spaces, but improve them. This new planning framework will help make this a reality. It will give local communities the power to protect green spaces that mean so much to them, while still giving the highest protection to our treasured landscapes such as national parks and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty. It will also ensure that development needed to grow the economy is carried out in a sustainable way.""

Business Secretary Vince Cable said:

> ""Strong, sustainable growth is the Government's top priority. The new proposals published today, a key element of the plan for growth, set out plans that are responsive to business whilst protecting the concerns of communities and their environment.
> 
> ""Along with the powerful presumption for sustainable development, the new approach to planning will be a significant step forward in creating the right conditions for businesses to start up, invest, grow and create jobs.""

The draft Framework requires that development is carried out in a sustainable way. Sustainable development is that which meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. It is central to the economic, environmental and social success of the country and is the core principle underpinning planning. Simply stated, the principle, as established by the Brundtland Commission in 1987, recognises the importance of ensuring that all people should be able to satisfy their basic needs and enjoy a better quality of life, both now and in the future.

Chair of the Major Developers Group, Sir Stuart Lipton said:

> ""We are delighted with the results of the proposals in the Framework as concepts. We have for years suggested that the planning system, with its accumulation of layers of directives and strategies needed radical reform. We support the strategies of the Framework which we feel will provide a more effective planning system. It will have regard for a balance of the interests of the community, the environment and the growth agenda.""

Chairman of National Association of Local Councils, Michael Carter said:

> ""The National Association is delighted that the overarching aim of the document is to empower communities, including very local parish and town councils, to shape the areas in which they live. We agree that they should have a major say in where housing, and other types of sustainable development, should go. The National Association believes that this is vital for sustainable economic growth in England. We welcome the fact that local communities will have the power to set their own standards that will meet the needs of local circumstances.""

Head of external affairs at the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors Stephen Thornton, said:

> ""The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors welcomes the Government's draft National Planning Policy Framework as a significant step forward in unlocking the planning system to deliver the growth required by UK Plc. We are pleased to see this concise outline of national planning policy at a strategic level rather than the thousands of pages of guidance that currently lose the thrust of what the Government is trying to achieve.""

Chief Executive of the Institute of Archaeologists, Peter Hinton said:

> ""The Framework sets out clearly Government's twin objectives of conserving the historic environment in a sustainable manner and of ensuring wide public benefit from expert investigations of those elements affected by development. We look forward to continuing to work with government in the coming weeks to make sure that the key heritage messages of the framework can be fully understood and implemented by heritage and property professionals, by local government, and by the communities they all serve.""

Director of Policy and Strategy of London First, John Dickie said:

> ""London First welcomes the publication of the draft National Planning Policy Framework which we believe will encourage growth and investment by consolidating planning guidance into a clear and concise document. Ending pages and pages of overlapping guidance and circulars has to be right. The draft Framework published today also signals the Government's continued commitment to liberalise the planning system which we strongly support.""

Chief executive of the British Property Federation Liz Peace, said:

> ""Planning policy should be streamlined, succinct and to the point if it is to deliver the growth and sustainable development that this country needs.
> 
> ""We understand that the new draft Framework follows closely the version submitted by the Practitioners Advisory Group which fully incorporated these principles. On that basis we will have no problem in giving today's Framework our ringing endorsement.""

Member of the Practitioners Advisory Group John Rhodes said:

> ""Most people involved in the planning industry recognise that it has become too complex and bureaucratic - and that it has lost sight of its principal purpose, which should be to deliver the homes, jobs and great places the country needs in an environmentally responsible way. The draft framework takes the opportunity to do something about that by making a real contribution to economic recovery and environmental objectives.""

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,25 July 2011
http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1954748,Audit Commission to outsource audit practice next year,"The Audit Commission will outsource all its in-house local public audit work to the private sector in the next financial year, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles announced today.

Ministers have determined this approach should offer the best value for money. This follows the decision to disband the Audit Commission last year which will refocus audit on helping local people hold their councils to account for local spending decisions.

The Commission has already been asked to begin substantive preparations for outsourcing. The contracts, which start from 2012-13, are expected to run for three or five years giving local councils and other public bodies the time to plan for appointing their own auditors.

A fair and competitive procurement process will be run that would give suitable private sector bidders the chance to compete for the Commission's audit work in a way that gives taxpayers best value for money.

This option would also allow for the possibility of a bid on behalf of the staff of the Audit Commission which could then form the basis for an employee owned company. Arrangements are in place to ensure such a bid does not have an unfair advantage.

The Commission will radically reduce in size by the end of next year as a consequence of outsourcing its audit work. Prior to primary legislation being enacted a small residual body will remain to oversee the contracts and make audit appointments. The Commission's inspection work and Comprehensive Areas Assessments has already ended.

Mr Pickles said:

> ""We have set in train measures to save council taxpayers money by radically scaling back on the centrally imposed, bureaucratic and costly audit and inspections previously undertaken by the Audit Commission.
> 
> ""This Government is determined to refocus local audit on helping local people hold councils to account. We believe that the next step is to outsource the audit practice next year as a way to secure best value for money.
> 
> ""We are working closely with the Audit Commission to design a fair procurement process that will allow a wide range of bidders, whether a mutual or private sector accountancy firm, to compete for the Commission's audit business.
> 
> ""Outsourcing will also allow further progress to be made on the new audit framework that will give councils the power to appoint their own auditors.""

The consultation on proposals for a new audit framework closed on 30 June 2011. Ministers are considering the proposals in light of the consultation responses received and the Government will bring forward primary legislation in due course. Once established the Audit Commission would be formally disbanded and local public bodies would appoint their own auditors.

### Notes to editors

1. Around 11,000 local public bodies are audited under the Audit Commission's regime, including local government, health and police bodies, national parks authorities and passenger transport executives.

2. The Audit Commission's Board met this morning and formally agreed the process for outsourcing the audit work from 2012-13 onwards.

3. The Audit Commission will be running two outsourcing processes in parallel, one for principal local public bodies and another for the smaller bodies which fall under the limited assurance regime following which private sector auditors (as opposed to Commission auditors) will be appointed to all local public bodies.

4. Outsourcing the Commission's in-house practice will mean that many of the Commission's audit staff would transfer with their work to the private sector under the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) (TUPE) terms. In line with previous practice, the Commission plan to allow for a significant period of consultation with local authorities prior to finalising appointments. Their procurement and consultation timetable means that appointments are planned by the start of the Annual Audit Cycle on 1 September 2012, which will be manageable as the focus of auditors work in the first half of the financial year is generally on the previous year's accounts.

5. The Commission will seek bids from audit firms on the basis of three and five year outsourced contracts. Longer outsourced contracts, five years as opposed to three, have the potential to generate lower audit fees. The Department therefore plans to engage in a short discussion with local public bodies about the trade off between the potential for lower audit fees and delaying the point at which local public bodies can appoint their own auditor once there is a better sense of the difference this makes to audit fees.

6. The Department for Communities and Local Government's Permanent Secretary, Sir Bob Kerslake, wrote to local authorities on 2 June 2011 to advise Ministers' initial view was that outsourcing was likely to offer the quickest, most straightforward and value for money option for transferring the work to the private sector.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1958014,Supporting more people back into work - councils to take the lead in boosting local economic prosperity,"Plans to put councils in charge of providing financial support for council tax which are designed to help more people back into work, maintain protections for pensioners and save the taxpayer up to £480 million a year have been published for consultation by Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles today.

Under the existing system local authorities are responsible for council tax rates and collection but do not control the policy on council tax benefit, which is run centrally from Whitehall.

Ministers are proposing to bring all aspects of the council tax system together at local level, freeing billing authorities how best to support working age households and establish stronger incentives for councils to get people back into work.

The changes to these benefits sit alongside the Government's wider welfare reforms that are focused on ending a culture of benefit dependency and on making sure that it always pays to work.

Pensioners will be protected against any reduction in support. Today's consultation considers how best to protect other vulnerable groups.

The cost of council tax benefit to taxpayers is equivalent to almost £200 per household a year. The changes will help to deliver a 10 per cent reduction in the current £4.8 billion annual council tax benefit bill across Great Britain, resulting in significant savings for the taxpayer.

The proposals to put councils in charge of providing support for council tax are part of a wider decentralisation policy that will give local authorities increased financial freedoms and a greater stake in the economic future of their local area. The reforms will align benefits with the wider council tax system creating a simpler, streamlined system, reducing bureaucratic burdens and costs. The Royal British Legion has previously called for Council Tax Benefit to be re-labelled a council tax 'rebate'.

The reforms will also give councils stronger incentives to tackle benefit error and fraud which are currently estimated to cost councils around £200 million a year.

Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""Plans to put councils in charge of providing support for council tax go hand in hand with wider economic reforms - such as the New Homes Bonus and our proposals for the local retention of business rates. In future, councils will have a much greater stake in the economic future of their area and greater incentives to support local residents back into work.
> 
> ""The new system will be a fairer one, where hard-working families and pensioners are not left to pick up a spiralling benefits bill and where work always pays.
> 
> ""Councils will be much better placed to attract new business and industry, better placed to help their residents get off welfare and reap the benefits of work instead. They will directly benefit from improving the prosperity of the local area that will in turn drive down their benefit bill.
> 
> ""Local authorities will have much greater freedom to administer rebates in a way that best meets local needs and best supports local people whilst safeguards will be put in place to protect the most vulnerable, including pensioners, from any reduction in the support that is on offer.""

The changes to the system will be introduced in 2013-14.

Plans to localise council tax benefit are intended to:

  * **give councils increased financial freedom and a greater stake in the economic future of their local area** - supporting the Government's wider agenda to enable stronger, balanced economic growth across the country.
  * **reduce expenditure on support for council by 10 per cent** - the reforms will create stronger incentives for councils to get people back into work and save taxpayers money - reducing the cost of benefits to hard-working families and pensioners.
  * **protect the most vulnerable in society**, particularly pensioners from any change in their level of support.
  * **enable councils to simplify the complex system of criteria and allowances** by aligning the support scheme more closely with the council tax system and so help reduce administrative costs.

Promoting work incentives is at the heart of the Government's programme of welfare reform. Ministers are clear that localised schemes should be delivered while supporting work incentives. One of the aims of localisation is to create stronger incentives for local authorities to get people back into work and support the positive work incentives that will be introduced through the Government's plans for Universal Credit.

In 2011 £4.8 billion was spent on council tax benefit in Great Britain and claimed by 5.8 million people.

Although council tax benefit is a national benefit with policy and rules set by central Government, it is administered by local authorities in England, Scotland and Wales.

The costs of council tax benefit are currently met by DWP from Annually Managed Expenditure.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2 August 2011
http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1959066,Grant Shapps: Swifter justice for victims of 'neighbours from hell',"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today announced plans to speed up the process for evicting persistent 'neighbours from hell' from their homes when all other efforts to curb their anti-social behaviour have failed.

He will propose to introduce a new mandatory power for possession, which will speed up the possession process by allowing previous convictions for serious anti-social behaviour to trigger eviction proceedings and short-cut the often long and expensive process which often requires landlords to prove again the 'yobbish' actions of their nightmare tenants.

Trigger offences are likely to include:

  * a conviction for a serious housing-related offence - including violence against neighbours, drug dealing and criminal damage
  * breach of an injunction for anti-social behaviour - where the social landlord has obtained, or is party to, the injunction; and
  * closure of a premises under a closure order - for example where a property has been used for drug dealing.

The Minister made clear that eviction should only ever be the last resort - but that too often the rights of victims have come second to those of the people making their lives a misery.

It is estimated that the Courts make 3,000 eviction orders for anti-social behaviour against social tenants each year. Most of the others are resolved through other support or enforcement measures such as mediation, acceptable behaviour agreements, Family Intervention Projects or injunctions.

But where landlords reach the last resort of eviction, survey data indicates that it takes on average seven months from applying for a possession order to being granted one. And with some defendants deciding to not turn up or cases being adjourned several times, it can sometimes take much longer.

The costs to landlords, and by extension their tenants, of evicting a 'neighbour from hell' can be well over £20,000 in complex cases.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""All too often, efforts to tackle neighbours from hell take far too long, and it seems the needs and right of the victims play second fiddle to those of the perpetrators.
> 
> ""That's why I'm looking to speed up the process, so where a social housing tenant already has a conviction for anti-social behaviour and the situation has not improved this can be taken into account and landlords can act swiftly to bring an end to the day-to-day misery that is inflicted for too long on those simply seeking to quietly enjoy their homes.
> 
> ""Of course eviction is a drastic step and should be the last resort that landlords take to tackle this menace - but when all other options have failed to stop this yobbish behaviour, victims should not have to wait months or even years to see justice done.""

Baroness Newlove, victims campaigner and the Government's Champion for Active Safer Communities, welcomed this new announcement, which she argued demonstrates clearly that the Government is on the side of victims not offenders.

She said:

> ""My postbag is filled with heartbreaking stories of law-abiding families whose lives are made a living hell by the actions of a few uncaring, selfish individuals whose thoughtlessness or ruthless criminal actions blight and intimidate whole neighbourhoods.
> 
> ""These victims of anti-social behaviour live in abject misery begging in vain for help from one agency or another and sometimes spend years, powerless to do anything about it. If they are owner occupiers they cannot sell their homes and move, such is the trap they are in. This has got to stop.
> 
> ""This action will go a long way to redress the balance in their favour.
> 
> ""We must empower social landlords to back the quiet suffering majority and deal swiftly with the criminal minority. I shall ensure my work gives maximum exposure so any citizen finding themselves in the same situation living next door to the neighbour from hell will have the knowledge and tools to finally see swift redress. Perhaps the very real threat of losing their home may bring to heel those who deny the right of a peaceful life to others.""

Baroness Browning, Minister for Crime Prevention and Antisocial Behaviour Reduction, said:

> ""I welcome these proposals. They build on those outlined in our recent 'More Effective Responses to Anti-social Behaviour' consultation and support the cross-government action on tackling anti-social behaviour, which is a key priority for us.
> 
> ""Our aim is to ensure that, in future, where a community or victim is suffering anti-social behaviour - particularly the sort of targeted, persistent harassment apparent in a number of high-profile recent cases - the police and other local agencies take the problem seriously, deal with it swiftly, and protect vulnerable victims.""

### Notes to editors

1. Today's consultation, _A new mandatory power of possession for anti-social behaviour_, has been published today and can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/antisocialbehaviourconsult](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/antisocialbehaviourconsult). The deadline for responses is 5pm on Thursday 27 October.

2. Examples of recent eviction cases include:

#### Poplar Housing and Regeneration Community Association

Two tenants of Poplar Housing and Regeneration Community Association carried out an extensive campaign of anti-social behaviour targeting their neighbour's family for many years. This included excessive noise, which was witnessed by relevant officers and the police.

As a result of the seriousness of the anti-social behaviour and the impact on the neighbour's young family, a Premises Closure Order was granted on their property in September 2009 - one of the first where drugs were not an issue. The order was later extended but the tenant appealed against the order. The appeal was finally dismissed by the Court of Appeal in October 2010.

In the meantime, the landlord had filed for possession order in the court on 27 October 2009. A directions hearing was held in January 2010 and a trial date was set for 19 November 2010. Pending the determination of the appeal against the closure order and the outcome of the possession case, the landlord took out an injunction excluding the tenants from the property in March 2010.

A possession order was granted on 7 April 2011, 18 months after the process began. Despite the evidence being proven to a criminal standard through to the High Court for the closure order, the landlord had to prove the case all over again for the possession order, putting the witnesses through another trial. Now the tenants have appealed against the possession granted. The total cost of the whole process so far to the landlord has been in excess of £38,000.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1972525,Grant Shapps: Reducing red tape so councils can invest more in affordable housing,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today announced Government plans to give councils more financial freedoms to improve, buy and build new housing for their local community.

New proposals, published today for consultation, will allow councils more flexibility to trade their assets, and use the receipts to enable further investment in new homes and regenerating the local area.

Rather than seeking permission from Ministers in every case, local authorities will have greater discretion to use and improve their council housing assets in a way that best suits their community.

Mr Shapps said today's move was in direct response to requests from councils across the country to streamline the complex regulations governing these sales and use of the receipts.

The new rules will protect existing tenants and ensure the money is spent for the benefit of the local community. The new rules will not affect occupied homes unless the sale is to the tenants themselves. Where assets are sold, councils will be able to keep the majority of receipts, as long as the money is spent on housing or the regeneration of the local area.

The extra flexibility will complement the most radical reforms to social housing in a generation, which are currently being introduced, and which are designed to bring a fundamental shift of power from Whitehall to councils and local housing associations.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""For years councils have been hamstrung in their attempts to use social housing to its maximum effect, with a lazy consensus amongst politicians trapping one of our most valuable resources in a system that helps far fewer people than it should.
> 
> ""If councils want to use their assets to improve the availability of housing for their local community, it is ridiculous that they are forced to ask a senior Government Minister for permission in every case. That's why I am today proposing greater freedom for councils to enable the judicious sale of assets.
> 
> ""I also want to end the complex regulations that make it difficult for councils to boost local investment in new housing. Our proposals will streamline the rules so councils can recycle more receipts from these sales into improving the local availability of affordable homes. These changes will make the system fairer - councils will now be able to make decisions that genuinely meet the needs of local people, and the changes will not any affect any existing tenants.""

### Notes to editors

1. The 'Streamlining council housing asset management: Disposals and use of receipts - Consultation' is available here: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/streamliningcouncilhousing](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/streamliningcouncilhousing).

2. Local authorities have powers under Part II of the Housing Act 1985 to dispose of council housing assets, but can use these powers only with the consent of the Secretary of State. Section 34 of the Act permits the Secretary of State to grant consent generally. This means where certain pre-conditions are met, a specific consent is not required.

3. Restrictions will apply to ensure this new power is used properly by councils. The disposal of housing assets at market value will not be allowed if:

> i. the disposal results in a tenant of the council becoming the tenant of a private landlord; or  
ii. the disposal is of a dwelling to a wholly owned subsidiary of the local authority (such disposals provide a means of avoiding the borrowing cap imposed under self-financing).

4. The Government is taking the opportunity of streamlining the regulations (the Local Authorities (Capital Finance and Accounting) (England) Regulations 2003 (as amended)) that govern use of the receipt arising from the disposal of council housing assets.

5. In addition to simplifying the regulations, the Government is clarifying in what circumstances the local authority must surrender 75 per cent of the receipt from a disposal to central Government. The proposal is for this to be the case when the sale is made to existing (or recent) council tenants. Receipts from sales to other individuals for owner-occupation may be retained provided they are used for specified purposes.

6. To facilitate the introduction of self-financing for social housing, these specified purposes will include spending on affordable housing and regeneration, and repaying housing debt connected to the particular asset being sold. Under the self-financing settlement, each local housing authority will take on a level of debt associated with each individual house or flat in its possession. It is therefore essential that when a local authority disposes of houses and flats it must have the option of clearing the debt associated with it. This will enable councils to maintain healthy balance sheets for their social housing, which is vital for continued investment in new housing.

7. The new powers will not affect current arrangements for Right to Buy.

8. Today's consultation is all about simplifying current processes. It means that where councils do want to sell certain stock (eg, selling to a former member of the armed forces to help them onto the housing ladder), they will be able to do so without first seeking permission from central Government. So this will lead to a speeding up of the process of selling a property - but not to any significant increase in the numbers of homes sold. The local authority must spend the receipt it gets on housing or regeneration.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1973349,Building greener homes costing less each year,"Building new homes to greener, low-carbon standards is getting cheaper every year, according to a [new report](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/codeupdatedcostreview) published today by Communities Minister Andrew Stunell.

The new research, based on interviews with developers and the latest information about environmental technologies, shows the overall extra costs of building new homes to standards set in the Code for Sustainable Homes is falling year on year.

For homes built to Code level 3 standards, average extra costs have fallen by almost three quarters in the last three years - falling from £4,458 in 2008 to £1,128 in 2010.

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""Building greener homes is vital if we are to meet our nation's commitment to reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change - so today's report is good news for the entire country. The progress that has been made does not only benefit developers building Code-standard homes, it also provides valuable lessons ahead of the transition to building new homes to zero carbon standards from 2016.
> 
> ""As a country we still have lot of work to do to reduce carbon emissions from new development, but what these figures show us is that as the construction industry continues to build more sustainable homes, there is further potential for the costs associated building greener homes to continue falling"".

### Notes to editors

1. The Code for Sustainable Homes is the national standard for the sustainable design and construction of new homes. The Code aims to reduce our carbon emissions and create homes that are more sustainable.

2. Beginning in 2007, the Code is used to measure the sustainability of new homes against nine design categories, each offering a range of 'credits' for meeting sustainability criteria. The more 'credits' secured the higher the Code star rating awarded to a development, up to Code level 6.Developers can chose which technologies and approaches they wish to use to minimise their costs and maximise their credits.

3. Every year since the Code started in 2007, a short piece of research has been conducted to establish approximately how much different Code standards and components cost, and what the trends are amongst developers in securing Code credits.  This latest report will be the third in the series, and was commissioned last year as part of the impact assessment underpinning the 2010 revision of the Code.

4. The work is based on primary research and interviews with both private and public housing developers, as well as modelling of cost trends across a wide range of environmental building technologies and services.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1974166,Shapps: more powers for communities to choose boats on water alongside bricks and mortar,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today urged local authorities not to become landlocked intheir quest to meet local housing needs - but to consider how new powers restoring local control over housing provision and planning can enable people to choose boats on water alongside bricks and mortar.

Mr Shapps said that more people than ever are choosing to make a boat their home and that boats with residential moorings could be an example of how unconventional housing can allow people to live in areas of the country where perhaps they couldn't afford to do so otherwise.

And as new moorings could be eligible for the New Homes Bonus, the Minister said that there was a strong incentive for councils and communities to grant planning permission for more residential moorings. The money that they receive could be invested in new marina facilities or waterside recreational activities that everyone could benefit from, as well as being used to attract further private investment and drive the regeneration of the often-Brownfield land around parts of the country's waterways.

Half the population live within five miles one of Britain's waterways and so not just those living on the water could benefit from the fresh injection of funding; water based recreation and tourism is thought to generate over £1 billion for local economies, and supports 24,000 jobs.

Mr Shapps said that the Government's commitment to Localism could be an opportunity for living on boats to be given a new lease of life, and allow people to secure a residential mooring that would allow them to live closer to their jobs, family, or children's school.

Citing the inexorable shift in power down to councils and communities, he said that where boaters, councils, navigation authorities and local communities work together, they could create more residential moorings as part of the contribution to increase the housing supply in their area and house more families:

  * new powers in the Localism Bill restoring local control over housing, and untying the hands of communities that will allow them to find innovative ways to meet local housing need and regenerate their area
  * handing over control of British Waterways in England and Wales - the country's biggest navigation authority - to the voluntary sector from April 2012, giving local communities a stronger role in determining the future of their waterways
  * the Government's commitment to a new, simpler planning system better tailored to the needs of communities
  * greater transparency from councils and other public bodies on their public property ownership - including on the waterside - allowing them to identify new development opportunities.

And emphasising the need to find a mooring with residential consent before choosing to live afloat, Mr Shapps said that creating more residential long-term moorings could also help reduce the numbers resorting to unlawful overstaying on the towpath.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""Whilst they will never overtake bricks and mortar in putting a roof over the heads of families, innovative new ways of housing families - such as residential moorings - play an important role in allowing people to live near to their place of work, children's school, or family, and where perhaps they would not be able to afford to otherwise.
> 
> ""Around 15,000 people live on our waterways and many more would like to do so. The Government's commitment to Localism could be an opportunity for living on boats to be given a new lease of life. Where houseboats pay council tax, communities will be eligible for the New Homes Bonus, so the potential economic benefits are huge.
> 
> ""Landlords, councils and communities all have a clear incentive to get more mooring sites in their areas and not become landlocked in their quest to meet local housing needs.""

Sally Ash, Head of Boating at British Waterways said:

> ""The number of people visiting and enjoying our canals and rivers has grown in recent years and this waterways renaissance has triggered strong demand from people wanting to live afloat.  We welcome the Minister's encouragement to local authorities to support the creation of purpose built residential mooring sites which we hope will help to alleviate localised congestion along the towpaths. We are also pleased to note the reassurance from Mr Shapps' department that people can qualify for housing benefit for help with mooring fees.""

Alan Wildman, Chairman of the Residential Boat Owners' Association (RBOA) said:

> ""Living afloat is arguably the most sustainable, lowest impact way to live, whilst still being able to enjoy 100 per cent of the modern amenities that are available to those who live in conventional housing.""

### Notes to editors

1. According to the Residential Boat Owners Association around 15,000 people live on boats on Britain's rivers, canals, and tidal waters.

2. British Waterways, the country's largest navigation authority responsible for 3,000 kms of navigable canals and rivers, estimates that it is host to around 7,000 residential boaters, but that the majority of these do not currently benefit from having a home mooring suitable for long term residential use.

3. British Waterways has recently published guidance for development of new residential moorings sites as an aid to local authorities and private investors, which is available at [www.britishwaterways.co.uk/resimoorguidance](http://www.britishwaterways.co.uk/media/documents/British_Waterways_guidelines_for_residential_mooring_sites_May_2011.pdf) (external link).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1974306,Bowling greens to be given special protections under new planning rules,"Bowling enthusiasts will be able to use new powers to safeguard treasured bowling greens from the threat of development or closure, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Eric Pickles said today.

Under new planning rules being proposed by the Government, communities will be able to classify green spaces such as bowling greens for special protections. New community rights will give local people a bigger say over what happens in their area and taken together these new powers could be used to ensure that pitches are preserved for the enjoyment of future generations.

The National Planning Policy Framework, published for consultation recently, includes a new local green spaces designation. The framework makes provision for green spaces to be identified by communities for special treatment within new neighbourhood plans. The designation could cover bowling greens as well as other recreational areas, wildlife havens or beauty spots. The plans are subject to a community vote and once agreed would go on to form part of the local planning policy.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""Bowling is one of the nation's most popular pastimes and the bowling green has long been part of the fabric of our towns and villages. The new powers we are proposing can help to preserve this part of England's sporting and cultural heritage for years to come.
> 
> ""The local pitch, pavilion, park or playing field are at the heart of community life, where people come together to play sport and socialise. Making sure people can go on enjoying their local amenities is at the heart of the changes being made to the planning system. We are putting power in the hands of communities and increasing protections for those spaces that are important to them.""

The changes outlined in the National Planning Policy framework to give local people greater control over much loved green spaces signals the strong emphasis the Government has placed on protection of the environment and local communities' interests in drawing up new planning rules.

The new protections are further reinforced by a new Community Right to Buy which gives local groups the opportunity to bid for bowling greens if they are facing the threat of being sold off. The new right, which is included in the Localism Bill currently making its way through Parliament, will enshrine in law measures to 'stop the clock' on any proposed sale, giving local bowlers the time they need to raise money. In addition, a new Community Right to Challenge will mean that local bowling clubs can bid to take over the running and management of a council-owned bowling green, placing the future of their resource more firmly in their own hands.

Mr Pickles added:

> ""I know that bowlers, as well as other community groups, have been frustrated by a sense of powerlessness to stop treasured assets and amenities disappearing. The rights we are putting into law will make sure that local people no longer have to stand by as decisions are made beyond their control. They will be on a much surer footing when it comes getting heard and getting the time and 'in' they need to determine what happens in their area.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1975025,Grant Shapps: Tenants to be trained to take control of their neighbourhoods post-riots,"In a move designed to strengthen tenants' say in the running of their local communities after the shocking scenes of rioting earlier this month, Housing Minister Grant Shapps today announced new training to give them the skills for running local 'tenant panels'.

Mr Shapps said that the recent riots showed that when communities come together to take a stand against those inflicting damage and disorder, they can have a real impact; the new training and creation of tenant panels would put powers back into the hands of tenants and give them a greater say on the running of their local community.

And he highlighted how more people came out to clean up after the riots than participated in the riots themselves.

He said that nobody knows their neighbourhoods better than tenants themselves and giving them real power to take control of local housing, could lead to services being better shaped around individual and local needs, benefiting everyone.

New powers in the Localism Bill propose to give tenants the opportunity to lead their local communities and be given a direct say on how the issues that matter most to local people - such as repairs, anti social behaviour and estate management - can be better tackled, by enabling tenant panels to consider complaints before referring them to the ombudsman.

So today, he announced that a registered charity The National Communities Resource Centre at Trafford Hall has been awarded £535,000 to deliver training and support to empower tenants to set up groups to lead on the management of their social housing. The training will focus on developing their skills and confidence to take positive local action to tackle problems that arise in their area. It is expected to deliver:

  * at least 1,500 social tenants trained to sit on tenant panels
  * at least eight different training courses covering a range of subjects - including sitting on tenant panels, influencing landlords, and sharing information and learning
  * seed grants for up to 100 tenants to help them spread learning in their community and kick start local initiatives; and
  * opportunities for interested tenants to work towards accredited qualifications, which could help them onto new career paths.

Mr Shapps said that the training would also help develop the skills and confidence of those who attend, putting real emphasis on social housing as a springboard to help people make better lives for themselves and their communities.

The Minister said that the training would complement the great strides that Government was taking to give new power and opportunities to social tenants:

  * Tenant Cashback - allowing social tenants to take control of the repairs budgets for their homes
  * Right to Manage - allowing tenants to take over responsibility for the management of their homes and estates; and
  * National Home Swap Scheme which will make it easier for tenants who want to move, to exchange properties across the country.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""We saw during the recent riots that when communities come together to take a stand against those causing deliberate damage, real action results. In fact, more people came out to clean up after the riots than participated in that appalling behaviour. Residents, including social housing tenants, want to make big positive differences to their communities - and I want to put the powers in their hands to be able to do so.
> 
> ""For too long, when there's a problem in their area, they have been told to sit tight and wait until action is taken on their behalf. The new powers and skills that tenant panels will bring will instead allow them to take control of their area; putting them at the heart of proposing solutions, and no longer simply putting up with the problems.
> 
> ""I want as many tenants as possible to sit on tenant panels, using their local knowledge to improve their area, and this training will allow them to do so - feeling capable and confident of taking on the challenge, and making a real difference.""

Sally Wyatt, Chief Executive Trafford Hall, said:

> ""The National Communities Resource Centre is committed to helping tenants play a lead role in the decisions that affect their communities and we are delighted at this news. The funding will allow us to offer many more tenants the opportunity to get the training and support they need to tackle some of problems that plague their communities and make a real difference at local level.""

### Notes to editors:

1. In June 2011, applications were invited from charities, benevolent societies and philanthropic institutions, as defined by the Charities Act 2006, for grant funding to deliver residential training to tenants living in social housing.

2. 22 applications were received and evaluated against criteria such as understanding of the aims and objectives, evidence of ability to deliver a national programme, experience and value for money.

3. Grant funding of up to £535,000 will be made available from the £8 million Tenant Empowerment Programme, announced in February 2011. This funding is intended to support activities over and above those that landlords should provide as part of their regulatory responsibilities.

4. The National Communities Resource Centre is a registered charity offering training and support to develop the skills, confidence and capacity of those living and working in low-income areas, to tackle housing-related problems and reverse poor conditions. It was set up in 1991 by Professor Brian Able-Smith, Lord Rogers of Riverside and Professor Anne Power with the aim of providing training and small seed funding grants to community groups to enable them to have a practical and positive impact on their local community.

5. Case studies of training provided at Trafford Hall include:

**Beacon Hill Tenants and Residents Association (Sedgley, West Midlands)**

  * Following an anti-social behaviour course, the group, in discussions with the police and other local groups applied for a small grant of £100 so that they could contribute to the cost of alcohol restriction zone signs that would enable the police to legally enforce the ban in the designated area.

  * Where the alcohol ban has been enforced there has been a reduction in street drinking and most significantly underage drinking. The police have reported a reduction in alcohol related anti social behaviour and there is a feeling that it has helped change for the better the profile of the area.

**Brickwell Estate Residents Group (Hull)**

  * The local Area Housing Board members attended a training course to give them the skills and knowledge to provide an effective housing service. The course covered responsibilities of Board Members, effective committee skills, budgeting and forward planning.
  * Following the training Board Members have been able to transfer this learning into their own localities. All those involved will now have better skills and confidence to contribute effectively and make full use of the opportunity that the meetings provide to help improve their local areas.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1975514,More communities chosen to try out new planning powers,"New powers to give local people unprecedented influence to determine the future of their areas are to be tried out in 36 more front-runner areas, Planning Minister Greg Clark announced today.

These areas are among the first to test out neighbourhood planning, a radical new power being introduced in the Localism Bill, which will give local people a real voice in deciding how development will look in their area.

For the first time, neighbourhood planning will allow communities to shape their own vision for their community, from deciding the locations of shops, offices and schools to setting standards of design for new housing and protecting green spaces of value to the community.

In areas where local people want to see homes and businesses built, neighbourhood planning will allow communities to grant a blanket planning permission for development to go ahead without developers having to make separate applications.

The community has the final say on whether a neighbourhood plan comes into force. If more than 50 per cent of people voting in a local referendum support the plan, then the local planning authority must bring it into force.

Neighbourhood planning is designed to return power to local people and local businesses on planning decisions in contrast to the top-down regional strategies being scrapped by the Government.

Planning Minister Greg Clark said:

> ""For too long local people have been shut out of the planning process with no real voice to affect decisions about the places where they live. Unpopular regional strategies left people without the ability to influence the future of their community and this fuelled resentment towards growth. Neighbourhood planning will hand power back to communities to decide the vision for their area as they see fit, encouraging people to plan positively for their future. This is localism in action and the enthusiasm across the country for neighbourhood planning shows how keen communities are to get involved.""

The 36 areas announced today are the next wave of 'front-runners' to test out neighbourhood planning, bringing the total to 126 across the country. Each front runner's local council is being given £20,000 to support work on neighbourhood planning and free advice from planning experts will be available for the local community. Examples of work to get underway include:

  * In Thame, South Oxfordshire, the town council is focusing their plan on the local need for more affordable housing and transport infrastructure, as well as developing open spaces and protecting the area's cultural heritage.

  * In Northumberland, two rural parishes are concentrating on the need for more affordable housing, a new high school and an education campus.

  * At the industrial estate at Trafford Park, the Greater Manchester Chamber of Commerce is working with Trafford Council on a Business Neighbourhood Plan to develop a state of the art, sustainable mixed use environment for high growth.

  * In Sherston, Wiltshire, the Parish Council is aiming to deliver new homes, especially affordable homes for elderly and disabled residents. Their plan will also look at the need for key local infrastructure such as high speed broadband and new schools, as well as opportunities to develop a community orchard.

  * At Uppingham in Rutland, local business and the community are working together on a neighbourhood plan for the town centre that will promote economic growth and social wellbeing.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,31 August 2011
http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1977816,A fair deal for the voluntary and community sector - from Whitehall to town halls,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has today published guidance to local authorities on how to protect voluntary and community groups from disproportionate cuts to their funding.

It follows warnings from Mr Pickles that councils should not ""pull up the drawbridge"" in this tough economic climate, but should instead look to give greater support for local groups that do so much for some of the most vulnerable in their communities.

Mr Pickles has also sought to cut reams of red tape on local councils to make it easier and more efficient for them to meet the needs of their residents. The Communities Secretary has scrapped 56 pages of prescriptive statutory guidance on local priorities introduced by the previous Government.

Instead, councils will have only one page of guidance on how best to achieve Best Value in their areas - not just in terms of cost for local taxpayers, but also the wider social and environmental benefits above and beyond the services they provide.

And in deciding how best to fulfil their Best Value Duty, councils are required to consult those using, or likely to use, a local service. This should include community and voluntary organisations.

This new deal sets out that councils should not pass on larger reductions to their local voluntary and community sectors and small businesses than they take on themselves. In particular:

  * those councils looking to reduce or end funding, or any other support to one of these organisations should give at least three months' notice of the actual reduction to both the organisation involved and the users of the service they provide
  * councils should involve and discuss their plans with the organisation and local service users as early as possible before making any final decisions on the future of the service; and
  * councils should give organisations, local service users and the wider community the opportunity to offer options for reshaping and reducing the costs of the services provided.

Central Government departments have already signed up to these same principles.

Mr Pickles said:

> ""Community and voluntary groups provide vital and valuable services to our communities, often aimed at some of the most vulnerable in our society. They deserve a fair deal.
> 
> ""That's why I'm introducing new guidance on councils to consider how they fulfil the Best Value Duty for their communities, not just in stark money terms but also in terms of the wider benefits to residents above and beyond the services that these organisations provide. And in return, I'm cutting reams of red tape that in the past have hampered council efforts to get their important work done.
> 
> ""I'm not asking councils to do anything that I wouldn't do myself, so all Central Government departments are now signed up to these fair new standards.""

In the new streamlined statutory guidance Mr Pickles has also clarified that there is no requirement for councils to undertake lifestyle or diversity questionnaires of their residents or their suppliers. Ministers want to see an end to the costly and unnecessary surveys and questionnaires being sent out by some councils alongside responses to residents' queries about rubbish collection or joining the local library. These surveys often ask personal questions about religious beliefs, sexual orientation and ethnicity, often duplicating information already collected in the Census.

Mr Pickles said:

> ""At a time when taxpayers are watching their pennies, the last thing councils should be doing is sending out unnecessary and intrusive questionnaires.
> 
> ""Local residents shouldn't be asked to reveal detailed personal information just because they've enquired about getting their bins emptied or how to join their local library.
> 
> ""Clamping down on such town hall activity will save taxpayers' money and protect the privacy of residents of all backgrounds.""

### Notes to editors:

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1979448,Bob Neill wants views on the future of the Fire Service College,"In a statement published today Fire Minister Bob Neill has asked for views on the future of the Fire Service College. He announced that the Government wants to explore options for a new ownership, operational and governance model for the College through greater involvement from other sectors, including voluntary organisations and the private sector. The Written Minsiterial Statement is available here: [www.communities.gov.uk/statements/corporate/fireservicecollegefuture](http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/newsroom/fireservicecollegefuture).

The College, located in Moreton-in the-Marsh, Gloucestershire is a leading provider of specialist training to the Fire and Rescue sector. However, the current Fire Service College ownership and business arrangements do not provide the flexibility necessary for the College to operate with sufficient commercial success and the Government is launching this exercise in order to inform its view of market appetite and viable options. The pre-market engagement document is available here: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/fire/fscpremarketengagement](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/fire/fscpremarketengagement).

This will allow any interested parties to offer clear views on the future of the College, and the Department to assess the reaction of the market to the aim of delivering a new model for the Fire Service College. The Government's preferred option for a Fire Service College of the future is a partnership between the public and private sectors with the fire sector playing a key role in that partnership. Whilst this is the preferred option, all options will be considered and any ideas on whether other arrangements may be more suitable are welcome.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1981559,Grant Shapps issues landlords with call to arms on tackling homelessness,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today called on the country's top 50 housing associations to use their expertise and wide-ranging experience to bolster Government-led efforts to tackle homelessness.

The Minister highlighted the need to help prevent people from sleeping on the streets, and to provide a lifeline to those who have been left languishing on social housing waiting lists for years.

On Wednesday, he met the 50 housing associations whose contributions will help ensure that the Government's Affordable Homes Programme will exceed original expectations.

Contrary to recent reports, the Government is on track to exceed original estimates of 150,000 new affordable properties - by 20,000 homes. The 50 developers Mr Shapps met today will build the vast majority of homes in the programme - some 75 per cent.

And going forward, the Government is also inviting views on the draft National Planning Policy Framework, which streamlines national policy from over 1,000 pages to just 52 pages of policy. Combining all national planning policies into one concise document will unblock the system to enable more homes to be built.

Many of these homes will be available for those people on social housing waiting lists - but the Government is also taking steps to help those who have been sleeping rough or are in temporary accommodation.

For the most vulnerable in our society, the Minister emphasised how the Government is maintaining the homelessness grant, with £400million funding available to tackle homelessness, while the London ""No Second Night Out"" project is being extended nationwide to ensure no-one spends more than one night on the country's streets.

And for the first time, the Government has established a Ministerial Working Group on homelessness, which brings together eight departments to tackle its complex causes.

And the Localism Bill currently before Parliament contains proposals to give councils flexibility to offer those owed the main homelessness duty good quality private rented housing - with legislation still in place to ensure no family spends time in Bed and Breakfast accommodation unless in an emergency, and then for no more than six weeks.

The Minister also pointed to the need to keep interest rates low, and to do this the Government must continue to cut the deficit it inherited, to help people stay in their homes. That is why reforms are being introduced to cut the housing benefit bill, but with a £190million fund available to councils to help those most in need.

Mr Shapps also highlighted how these 50 housing associations area valuable part of the solution to tackling homelessness, and can use their expertise to provide the stable and secure roof over the heads of those people in desperate need of housing.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""There is a need to tackle homelessness in this country. Families who have been languishing on waiting lists for years are crying out for the stability and security that a new home can provide, and I want to see an end to the need for anyone to sleep rough on Britain's streets.
> 
> ""That's why for the first time we have a cross-Whitehall group of ministers dedicated to tackling its complex causes, and it's why we're maintaining £400million homelessness grant funding. But I also see a crucial role for housing associations.
> 
> ""Already they are helping to ensure our Affordable Homes programme exceeds expectations and delivers up to 170,000 new homes. But today I'm calling on the country's top 50 landlords to work with Whitehall and Town Halls and offer their experience and expertise to help those in greatest need across the country.""

Alongside the Affordable Housing Programme the Government has already made £200million payments to councils through the New Homes Bonus, which matches the council tax raised on new properties for six years - with extra funding for new affordable homes.  Further funding is due to be announced shortly.

The Minister highlighted the new FirstBuy Scheme, which will help over 10,500 people get their first foothold on the property ladder, as a key measure the Government is taking to help more people realise their dream of home ownership.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1984732,Grant Shapps issues message to struggling households: seek early support,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today sent a clear message that any household threatened with homelessness must seek help and advice as early as possible.

He said that a wide range of support remains available to those struggling to stay in their homes and that local councils have a strong track record of providing support to households at risk of homelessness and so should be a first point of call for anyone worried about holding onto their home.

The Minister was speaking as new figures out today show there were 11,820 people owed a main homelessness duty in the second quarter of the year - 17 per cent higher than the same period in 2010.

But the numbers of people in temporary accommodation on 30 June this year fell by four per cent compared to the same date in 2010.

Councils have a duty to ensure that free housing advice and information is available for everyone seeking it and that they may be able to help people stay in their home by:

  * providing budget and rent advice - if a household is having problems paying the rent and are at risk of losing their home;
  * helping find out if households are eligible for any benefits to help with housing costs; and
  * speaking to the landlord on behalf of those at risk of eviction, or offering a rent bond to help them find alternative private rented accommodation.

People can also speak to their mortgage lender who may be able to change the terms of mortgages to make repayments more affordable, or to an independent charity such as Shelter, the National Debtline or Citizens Advice Bureau, who could provide advice and help with managing finances.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""Whilst homelessness remains at a historic low, today's figures underline how the effects of the worst recession for a generation continue to deliver difficult times for households up and down the country.
> 
> ""But anyone facing financial difficulty or the prospect of losing their own home is not alone. There is help available and everything will be done to help people avoid homelessness: I urge anyone who thinks they may be at risk of losing their home to take action immediately, and give themselves a greater chance of staying in it.
> 
> ""Whilst this Government gets on with the rescue mission on our economy - dealing with the huge deficit we inherited to avoid the need for rapid increases in interest rates and keep further pressure off households, households themselves must seek early support from their council, lender or one of the charity bodies who offer support.""

Yesterday, Mr Shapps met with 50 housing developers to hear about their plans to get Britain building again and how Government-led efforts to help those in housing need are being supported by the industry. And he heard first hand how the Affordable Homes Programme will exceed original expectations - delivering an estimated 150,000 new affordable properties - an increase of 20,000 homes on that expected.

He said that this demonstrated that Government was taking the action necessary to getting the economy back on track, support growth and shore up the long-term outlook for homeowners. Other measures crucial to this he said were reforming the slow and inefficient planning system and cutting red tape and scrapping costly regulations, to make housing more affordable and unlock new investment in the sector.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1985456,Firefighter pension reform consultation begins,"A statutory consultation on proposed changes to contribution rates made by firefighters towards their pensions was published today by the Department for Communities and Local Government.

The consultation document sets out proposals for increased employee contributions to the two firefighter pension schemes for the financial year 2012-13.

The consultation proposes that the lowest earning firefighters will see the lowest increases while higher earners, such as chief fire officers, would pay a higher contribution. Members of the New Firefighters Pension Scheme, which has more balanced contributions, will see lower contribution increases.

The Government has already announced that the pension pots that firefighters have already accrued will be protected. This will not change. When firefighters take their pension built up in their final salary schemes it will be based on their final salary at the time of retirement, meanwhile firefighters will have the opportunity to build up their pensions under the reformed schemes for the remainder of their service.

The Government asked Lord Hutton of Furness to review all public sector pensions and to make recommendations on pension arrangements that are sustainable and affordable in the long term, fair to both the public service workforce and the taxpayer and consistent with the fiscal challenges ahead. In his interim report, Lord Hutton reported that people are living much longer and the cost of public sector pensions has risen by a third over the past ten years to £32billion. As Lord Hutton said in his report, ""these costs have generally fallen to the taxpayer"".

The Government believes that reform is therefore necessary to ensure all public service pension schemes remain fair, affordable and sustainable for current and future generations of public sector workers.

Following Lord Hutton's interim report, the Government set out at the Spending Review 2010 its intention to secure £2.8billion savings per year by 2014-15, by increasing employee contributions in public service pension schemes by an average of 3.2 per cent, to be phased in from April 2012. For the firefighters' pension schemes, this means delivering savings of £33million per year by 2014-15.

Today's proposals represent around 40 per cent of the total savings required by 2014-15. Discussions with trade unions and employer representatives on how to deliver the remaining savings, and the wider Hutton reforms, remain ongoing.

Fire Minister Bob Neill said:

> ""Firefighters perform an incredibly important job as the events last month illustrated so powerfully. That's why we want to make sure their pensions remain among the very best available with a guaranteed pension level for all employees - something very few private sector jobs now offer.
> 
> ""However, Lord Hutton's report was absolutely clear that with people living longer, public sector pensions need to have a fairer balance between what employees and taxpayers contribute.
> 
> ""The proposals set out today will start to deliver that rebalancing. A typical firefighter in the 2006 Scheme would only pay £11 more a month as a result of our proposals.
> 
> ""I can reassure firefighters that the pension pots they have already built up will be protected.""

### Notes to editors

1. The proposals set out today will deliver around £13.2million of savings from the Firefighters' Pension Scheme and New Firefighters' Pension Scheme in 2012-13. The consultation document can be found on the Department for Communities and Local Government website: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/fire/firefighterpensioncontributions](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/fire/firefighterpensioncontributions).

2. The consultation applies only to Fire and Rescue Authorities in England and closes on 2 December 2011.

3. The proposed changes only affect employee contribution rates in 2012-13. Tables setting out the proposed contribution rates can be found in the consultation document.

4. There are two separate Firefighter pension schemes. They are the Firefighters' Pension Scheme (1992) and the New Firefighters' Pension Scheme (2006).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1988981,The Audit Commission - appointment of new commissioners,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has today announced that Robert Light has been appointed to the Audit Commission Board, as the Government presses ahead with the disbandment of the Commission and the outsourcing of the work of its audit practice to the private sector.

Councillor Light joins as the Conservative representative on the Board and brings considerable knowledge and experience which should assist the Commission during this period of change. The Commission has three 'political' posts on the Board, representative of the three main political parties and reflective of the Commission's principal stakeholder - local authorities. This appointment follows the resignation of Sir Merrick Cockell, the previous Conservative representative who left to take up his post as Chair of the Local Government Association.

Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, Eric Pickles, said:

> ""I am pleased to announce the appointment of Robert Light. He brings significant practical public sector experience to the Board. His extensive links and knowledge of the Commission's work will prove invaluable to the Board.""

Eric Pickles announced in August 2010 plans to disband the Commission and refocus audit on helping local people hold councils and local public bodies to account for local spending decisions.

Subject to Parliament enacting the necessary legislation, local audits will be regulated within a statutory framework overseen by the National Audit Office and the profession. Councils will appoint their own independent external auditors and there will be new audit arrangements for local health bodies.

On 5 September 2011, the Audit Commission launched a process to outsource the work of its in-house audit practice to the private sector, including a potential employee-led company.

### Notes to editors

1. Councillor Robert Light has been a member for Kirklees Council since 1987. He is currently the Deputy Chair of the Local Government Association and an IDeA (Improvement and Development Agency for Local Government) peer. He has been part of a Comprehensive Performance Assessment team for four local authorities and brings considerable experience from his involvement in the close down of Firebuy ltd. He is currently a Board member of the Environment Agency. He receives £16,802 per annum (2010-11).

2. The appointment will cover the period from 14 September 2011 to 31 December 2012. The Commissioners will be paid £14,358 per annum based on a time commitment of 3 days per month. The appointment has been made in accordance with the Code of Practice for Ministerial Appointments to Public Bodies - The Commissioner for Public Appointments. Councillor Light's political activity has been declared to the Department.

3. The Audit Commission was established in 1983 to appoint auditors for councils, NHS bodies (excluding Foundation Trusts), police authorities and other local public services across England.

4. DCLG launched a consultation on the Future of Local Audit on 30 March 2011. The consultation period closed on Thursday 30 June and we are currently analysing responses received. Following consideration of responses to the consultation, we will publish our proposals in a draft bill to allow full Parliamentary scrutiny. A final bill will then be introduced as soon as Parliamentary time allows.

5. The Audit Commission began a procurement process on 5 September to outsource the work of its in-house audit practice with effect from 2012-13. This follows Ministers conclusions that outsourcing was likely to offer the best value for money, as well as being the quickest and, in their view, the most straightforward option for transferring the work to the private sector. Ministers therefore asked the Commission to design a fair and competitive procurement process that would allow a range of firms to bid for the work. At its meeting on 28 July 2011, the Commission Board agreed to undertake the procurement exercise. Ministers announced the decision on the same day.

6. The Labour representative on the Audit Commission Board is Stephen Houghton and the Liberal Democrat Commissioner is Sir David Williams, who was appointed on 6 July 2011.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1996846,Pickles hails next wave of council transparency,"The next wave of council openness was hailed today by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles as he published the final Code of Recommended Practice for council transparency which will help reveal the fine details of authorities' daily business, including senior salaries and contracts.

Already every council in England except Nottingham City Council publishes data on all their spending over £500 on a regular basis.

Ministers believe that data transparency should extend beyond local spending and that full disclosure should be every council's default position. Councils will now be expected to have regard to the Code in all their data publications. Subject to consultation, ministers are minded to make the Code a legally binding requirement to ensure authorities can be held fully accountable to the local people they serve.

The code of practice calls on local authorities such as councils and fire and rescue services to shine a light on every part of their business, from employees' salaries over £58,200 and details of all their contracts and tenders to details of grants to voluntary organisations, performance information and the locations of public land and building assets. It also establishes three key principles behind council transparency; timeliness, openness and mindfulness of local demand.

Releasing this information to the public could provide a wealth of local knowledge and spark more improvements in the way services are delivered. Faster publication and easier access for the public and companies could open new possibilities for real-time analysis and response and opportunities for small businesses to enter new markets.

The best local authorities have already adopted the code of practice into their normal publishing routines. Councils like Northamptonshire County Council, Hammersmith and Fulham and Windsor and Maidenhead for example have long ago thrown their books wide open for public scrutiny and publish much of the data specified in the code already.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""We have always maintained that the best local leaders, those with control of the public purse strings, should be open and accountable for every one of their decisions. We have abolished top down inspection making local accountability more important than ever. Central Government has a role in ensuring that local people can exercise their right to know how their money is being spent and have the information they need to question that spending.
> 
> ""But spending data is just one aspect of transparency. There is a wealth of information on the inner workings of councils across the country - from senior salaries and council assets to everyday decision making processes - and we shouldn't have to be data experts to see and understand it.
> 
> ""The code sets out clear expectations. It will help unlock more information and increase accessibility for everyone, taking us one step closer to our ambition to be the most transparent government in the world.""

In June the Prime Minister wrote an open letter to the Cabinet outlining what the Government has achieved in terms of transparency over the past year and what it intends to do over the next (see link right).

In the spirit of transparency the Department for Communities and Local Government has already released a vast amount of its data, including spending figures, contracts, Ministerial data and organisational information. We will continue to lead the way, and are publishing all 229 responses to the consultation on the Code of Practice today.

### Notes to editors

1. The Code of Recommended Practice for Local Authorities on Data Transparency applies to England only. Local authorities, including councils and fire and rescue services, will be expected to comply with data protection law and to take a risk management approach to payment fraud. ([www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/transparencycode)](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/transparencycode)

2. The Department consulted on the Draft Code of Recommended Practice for Local Authorities on Data Transparency from 7th February 2011 to 14th March 2011. Consultation Summary and all responses to the consultation can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/codepracticeladataresponses](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/codepracticeladataresponses)

3. The Code asks local authorities to follow the three principles of transparency when publishing data - Demand-led, Open and Timely. The Code also proposes the minimum datasets that should be released for reuse.

They are:

  * expenditure over £500, (including costs, supplier and transaction information)

  * senior employee salaries, names, budgets and responsibilities of staff paid over £58,200 - equivalent to the lowest Senior Civil Service pay band

  * an organisational chart

  * the 'pay multiple' - the ratio between the highest paid salary and the median average salary of the whole of the authority's workforce

  * councillor allowances and expenses

  * copies of contracts and tenders to businesses and to the voluntary community and social enterprise sector

  * grants to the voluntary community and social enterprise sector should be clearly itemised and listed

  * policies, performance, external audits and key inspections and key indicators on the authorities' fiscal and financial position

  * the location of public land and building assets and key attribute information that is normally recorded on asset registers

  * data of democratic running of the local authority including the constitution, election results, committee minutes, decision - making processes and records of decisions.

4. The Code is published under the Local Government, Planning and Land Act 1980, which gives the Secretary of State the power to issue a code about the publication of information by local authorities about the discharge of their function. The Act also empowers the Secretary of State to introduce subsequent regulation should that be necessary to enforce greater transparency.

5. Details of local authorities' publishing spend data can be found via the Local Directgov council expenditure over £500 search tool (see link right).

6. The Department for Communities is leading the way across Whitehall and Local Government by publishing a wealth of information including spend (see link right).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1999007,Eric Pickles: £250m for councils to support weekly bin collections,"A new fund of up to £250million will support councils to deliver a weekly collection of household waste and improve the environment, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles announced today (30 September 2011).

The new Weekly Collections Support Scheme will both support weekly collections and enable councils to invest in schemes and projects that will benefit the environment including through raising recycling rates. In the coming months councils will be invited to submit innovative bids for funding.

Ministers believe more frequent collections are likely to discourage fly-tipping and littering as well as reducing problems with vermin and pests.

Mr Pickles said:

> ""Weekly rubbish collections are the most visible of all front-line services and I believe every household in England has a basic right to have their rubbish collected every week.
> 
> ""Our fund will help councils deliver weekly collections and in the process make it easier for families to go green and improve the local environment.""

Caroline Spelman, Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, added:

> ""Hard-pressed families across the country pay their council taxes and local authorities should be looking to deliver the kinds of frontline services that they want. This new fund will help councils whose residents want their rubbish collected more frequently to reinstate weekly bin rounds for smelly waste, while also seeking new and innovative ways to increase recycling and look after the environment.""

Councils will be able to bid individually or in consortiums, and with the private sector, where that increases value for money. In order to encourage the most innovative and locally tailored solutions, authorities will be able to bid for a mix of revenue and capital funding. Further detail of how the Support Scheme will operate and how councils can bid will be set out in due course.

### Notes to Editors

1. The Waste Review published this summer stated that 'The Government will be working with local councils to increase the frequency and quality of rubbish collections and make it easier to recycle, and to tackle measures which encourage councils specifically to cut the scope of collections. The Government understands that the public have a reasonable expectation that household waste collections services should be weekly, particularly for smelly waste' (Government Review of Waste Policy in England, p.7).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2004266,Local Government Pension Scheme consultation begins,"A statutory consultation proposing changes to local government pensions that deliver fair cost savings has been published today by the Department for Communities and Local Government.

The Government's draft proposals aim to deliver short-term savings of £900 million, by 2014/15 to the Local Government Pension Scheme in England and Wales. This was set in the Spending Review 2010, which required all public service schemes to make savings to protect the taxpayer.

In recognition of the way the Local Government Pension Scheme is funded it was agreed alternative ways to find savings could be considered if they retained council taxpayer protections. The consultation proposes a balanced mix of increasing employee contributions and adjusting the accrual rates.

The paper proposes a progressively phased increase in employees' contribution tariff from April 2012 that would raise an additional £450 million, or 1.5 per cent of pay, and a change in the accrual rate from April 2013 to raise an additional £450 million, or 1.5 per cent of pay.

The consultation actuarially acknowledges that a lower contribution tariff increase but offset by a larger change in accrual rate, or vice versa, could also deliver the required level of savings.

Any increases in contribution rate will progressively protect low earners and mean high earners pay in proportionally more reflecting their more generous pensions. This mean the Local Government Pension Scheme will continue to be an attractive scheme to all existing and future members.

To that effect a revised pension contribution tariff included in the package proposes:

  * no increase in contribution for all those Scheme members earning less than £15,000
  * no more than a 0.6 per cent increase for those earning up to £21,000 in 2012/13; and
  * high earners will pay progressively more than those in lower salary bands.

Local Government Minister Bob Neill said:

> ""Lord Hutton's report sets out why public sector pensions need to be reformed to more fairly protect taxpayers.
> 
> ""Today's pension proposals set out a way to save £900 million over the next three years that protects low earners from excessive increases - those who earn less will be asked to pay in less than high earners in the Scheme.
> 
> ""We will continue to engage with local government and trade unions throughout the consultation as they have a key role to play. We hope all parties will take the time to consider these proposals in a constructive manner.""

### Notes to editors

1. The Government commissioned Lord Hutton to chair the Independent Public Service Pensions Commission to review public service pensions and to make recommendations on how these can be made sustainable and affordable in the long-term, whilst at the same time being fair to both public sector workers and the taxpayer. Lord Hutton concluded that reform was needed. The cost of local government pensions to the taxpayer rose from £1.8 billion in 1997 to £6 billion now. The Government accepted his recommendations as a basis for consultation with public sector workers, trade unions and other interested parties about the need for long term reform of public service pension arrangements.

2. In advance of that long term reform process, Lord Hutton published his interim report on 7 October 2010, and recommended that if the Government wished to make short term savings to meet current cost pressures, then raising contribution rates would be the most effective way to achieve that objective. Lord Hutton's interim report is available via the HM Treasury website at: [www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/indreview_johnhutton_pensions.htm](http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/indreview_johnhutton_pensions.htm) (external link).

3. The closing date for responses is 6 January 2012. The intention is that the proposed amendments to the Scheme's regulatory framework, will take effect on 1 April 2012, subject to the outcome of this consultation exercise. Full details of the consultation paper can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/pensionconsultation](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/pensionconsultation).

4. The progressive phasing of the employee contribution tariffs to achieve savings of £450 million would look as follows:

  
  


5. This consultation exercise marks the start of the formal statutory consultation process for proposed amendments to the Local Government Pension Scheme Regulations (mentioned above), as required by section 7(5) of the Superannuation Act 1972.

6. The publication of the Local Government Pensions Scheme consultation follows a period of discussion between the Local Government Group and local authority trades unions about pension savings by 2014/15. If those discussions continue through The Local Government Pension Scheme Policy Review Group which has extensive representative membership of employees and trade unions, or any other proposals eventually come forward, whether separately or jointly, these can also feed into the statutory consultation process alongside any other comments or proposals submitted by other consultees.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2007565,Communities to get new planning powers to bring jobs and homes to their neighbourhood,"New planning powers giving communities the ability to shape the character of their neighbourhood were published for consultation today by Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark.

Neighbourhood Planning will for the first time give communities a real voice in deciding the look and feel of development in their area. Local people will be able to have their say on the location of new homes, the design of buildings, the shops they want to see in the High Street, and the green spaces that should be protected.

The new powers being introduced in the Localism Bill will also give local people the power to decide the types of development that can be granted automatic planning permission, through a Neighbourhood Development Order.

The regulations being published for consultation make clear how a neighbourhood area will be defined, how to set up the forums that will propose plans, and will also outline the requirements for establishing a Neighbourhood Development Order.

An easy to understand guide to Neighbourhood Planning is also being published today to make it easier for communities to use the new powers.

Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark said:

> ""For the first time local people will have a real voice in deciding the look and feel of development in their area through Neighbourhood Planning.
> 
> ""Communities will be able to shape their own vision for the future as they see fit. They will be able to protect what makes their town or village special, including green spaces, and have their say on the design and location of new homes.
> 
> ""There has been real enthusiasm across the country to test out Neighbourhood Planning and today's consultation is the next step in preparing the ground before the powers become widely available.""

The regulations draw on existing procedures where possible to minimise the time communities and councils need to become familiar with the new system.

There are now 126 communities acting as 'frontrunners' for testing out the principles of Neighbourhood Planning. Applications are now being accepted for a fifth wave of frontrunners.

### Notes to editors

1. The closing date for comments on the proposed regulations is 5 January 2012.

2. Further information on the consultation can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/planningregulationsconsultation](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/planningregulationsconsultation).

3. Also launched today are an easy to understand guide to Neighbourhood Planning, available here: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/introductionneighbourplanning](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/introductionneighbourplanning) and an e-flyer for communities to promote neighbourhood planning, available here: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/neighbourhoodplanningeflyer](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/neighbourhoodplanningeflyer).

4. Applications for the fifth wave of frontrunners must be received by 4 November 2011. More information on how to apply and a list of the front-runners testing out Neighbourhood Planning can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/planningandbuilding/planningsystem/neighbourhoodplanningvanguards/](http://www.communities.gov.uk/planningandbuilding/planningsystem/neighbourhoodplanningvanguards/).

5. Regulations on the requirements for Community Right to Build organisations and the Orders they can establish are also being consulted on. Community Right to Build ensures people have the power to decide what they want to build in their communities.

6. The Government is bringing forward a number of reforms to the planning system, aimed at restoring democratic and local control and shifting power to communities. The Localism Bill is a key vehicle for achieving this and is currently being debated in the House of Lords.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2008421,Lincolnshire Council to lead new network supporting councils go for growth,"Lincolnshire County Council has been selected to head up a new housing growth best practice network that will champion effective approaches to sustainable growth the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government announced today.

The Government has ended top down targets and is committed to giving power over housing and other development back to people, communities and councils. This includes abolishing regional strategies with their centrally imposed housing targets.

The changes put local authorities in the driving seat when it comes to delivering the right growth for their area and the work that Lincolnshire County Council will lead will provide a range of support and advice that councils can draw on in developing plans and applying the very best practice when it comes to delivering sustainable development.

Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Eric Pickles said:

> ""We have moved away from the Whitehall knows best approach where central government dictated to councils what and where to build. Local councils are now free to take the decisions that are right for their communities and Lincolnshire County Council will establish a range of support, advice and links to key organisations that will help councils in getting on and deliver sustainable growth.""

The council will take over the running and management of the growth points website that will provide a range of advice and guidance based on local authorities sharing experience on how they can successfully tackle environment and infrastructure issues affecting housing growth such as flooding, water supply, nature conservation impacts and transport. They will establish an advisory group bringing together local authorities, publicising case studies, linking with the private sector and universities as well as relevant departments and agencies.

The Department for Communities and Local Government is making £44,000 funding available over the next two years to support Lincolnshire in delivering this key piece of work.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2009528,"It's Time to Test: Change your clock, test your smoke alarm","A new hard-hitting advertising campaign is urging people to make a potentially life-saving move when they change their clocks on the weekend of 29/30 October - by taking a moment to test their smoke alarm too.

The twice-yearly clock change is a task that everybody takes for granted. Turning the clocks back for an extra hour in bed will already be on the 'to-do' list for the majority of British households over the clock change weekend.

While timekeeping is a vital part of our lives and we all keep our clocks working to stay on track, it's shocking to know that many people forget to ensure the safety of themselves and their loved ones by keeping their smoke alarm in the same working order.

A working smoke alarm can buy you valuable time to get out, stay out and call 999. But only half of all householders who own a smoke alarm say that they test it's working on a regular basis.

You're more than four times as likely to die in a fire if your smoke alarm is not working. So it's clear that the simple act of testing your alarm is a vital part of any household routine.

In 2010-11, there were over 36,000 accidental fires in the home, resulting in 246 fatalities and more than 7,000 casualties. The Fire Kills Campaign hopes that by adding this simple smoke alarm check to people's clock-change routine, many more lives will be saved.

Fire Minister Bob Neill said:

> ""Everyone soon notices when a clock stops ticking, but it's more difficult to be sure that your smoke alarm is still in working order. The only way to make sure is through regular testing.
> 
> ""When the campaign began in 1988 only 9 per cent of homes had a smoke alarm - now that figure is 86 per cent. But having a smoke alarm is not enough - it must be kept in working order to save your life.
> 
> ""The number of fire deaths in homes has halved since 1988 but if everyone takes time to test their alarm regularly we can make sure they don't go up again.
> 
> ""We're all looking forward to getting that extra hour's sleep as British Summer Time comes to an end. Knowing that your smoke alarm is in working order will help you sleep that little bit better.""

The Government's Chief Fire and Rescue Adviser Sir Ken Knight said:

> ""You're more than four times as likely to die in a fire without a working smoke alarm. But despite the fact that nearly 250 people died in house fires last year, only half of the people who own an alarm say they take the time to check that it's working.
> 
> ""A smoke alarm can give you the vital time you need to get out, stay out and call 999 in a house fire. As you put your clocks back on 29 or 30 October take an extra moment to push the button on your alarm to make sure it is working properly - it could save your life.""

Listen out for radio and press adverts supporting the _Change your clocks, Test your smoke alarm_ campaign and find out more on the Fire Kills Facebook page (www.facebook.com/firekills).

An online video has also been released showing a mantelpiece clock melting in the heat of a house fire - bringing home the harsh reality of the consequences of a fire in the home. See it at [http://bit.ly/firekillsclock](http://youtu.be/3aw1JmjIA-I) (external link).

Help keep yourself and your loved ones safe in the home by following these simple steps:

  * A working smoke alarm can buy you valuable time to get out, stay out and call 999. Make sure you fit one on every level of your home and test them regularly.

  * Make testing your smoke alarm part of your household routine. Check the alarm by pressing the button regularly; change your battery once a year or invest in a 10-year alarm; and clean the alarm casing twice a year to ensure dust doesn't block the sensor.

  * Whatever happens, never remove the battery in your smoke alarm.

  * Make sure that everyone in your home knows what to do in a fire and practise your escape route.

  * For more information visit the Fire Kills campaign's Facebook page at [facebook.com/firekills](https://www.facebook.com/firekills) (external link).

If you want an extra nudge to test your smoke alarm regularly, try setting an automatic reminder. Safelincs, in partnership with the Fire Kills, has created a free service that reminds you, by email or text, when it's time to test your smoke alarm, change the battery or renew the unit. The service is completely free and can be cancelled at any time ([www.safelincs.co.uk/reminders](http://www.safelincs.co.uk/reminders/)) (external link).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2016851,Eric Pickles - Help for the High Street in the wake of the riots,"Hundreds of businesses have already benefited from the multi-million pound package of support made available to communities in the immediate aftermath of the summer disturbances, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles announced today.

Ministers responded to the riots with immediate help by making a multi-million package of support available in grants and tax relief to ease financial pressures, get shops open and repair damaged high streets, which 35 councils have taken up.

Mr Pickles used a speech to council leaders at the Local Government Association to reaffirm Government's commitment for councils to pull out all the stops, support high street recovery and get businesses back on their feet. He highlighted examples of councils up and down the country that have dedicated time and resources to getting help to individuals and businesses. He also congratulated them for supporting communities to get back up and running, backed up by central government funding and assistance.

Mr Pickles also used his speech to announce that shopkeepers and businesses affected will get extra time to apply for financial support and assistance. The deadline for councils to submit claims under the Government's £20 million High Street Support Scheme was originally set for early November. In response to requests from councils and shopkeepers and to cover the crucial Christmas period, the Communities Secretary has taken the decision to extend the deadline until the New Year. He is adamant that money available must reach those that need it.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""Both central and local government are making sure the innocent victims of these mindless acts of looting and violence are not left to pick up the pieces on their own. Real help is being delivered to local firms and local residents.
> 
> ""Councils deserve immense credit for the way in which they swung into action in the days during and after the disturbances. Local leadership played a massive part in limiting the distress and difficulty that families, individuals and businesses faced.
> 
> ""It is great to see examples from across the country of how the support can and is being delivered in the right way. Affected councils are still receiving claims from businesses, and we have listened to councils in agreeing more time for them to promote pride and increase footfall in their high streets in the run up to Christmas.""

Many councils have been very quick off the mark in offering all kinds of support to local traders: 

**Croydon Council** has provided more than £205,500 of interest free loans to the worst affected traders to help them get back on their feet. Thanks to their swift support, most traders re-opened their businesses very quickly. The council granted  £1,000 to any business with a crime reference number to help with the clean up. The police made direct contact with the council, which then made a payment without the need for a formal 'claim' to be made by the affected businesses. So far the council has given £249,000 in hardship grants to businesses, £137,129 in business rates hardship relief, which forms part of the council's £882,000 local investment from the High Street Support Scheme as well as an additional £145,000 being provided from the Croydon Enterprise Loan Fund.

When the Communities Secretary visited **Salford** he saw how the council quickly put in place an ""I love Salford"" campaign to galvanise civic pride. Residents and local businesses have been sporting ""I love Salford"" badges, displayed posters and giant ""I love Salford"" messages in shop windows.

**Wandsworth** immediately offered grants of up to £2000 to replace stock, suspended business rates collection straightaway to ease cash flow pressures and introduced a business rate discount scheme for eligible businesses that was backdated to the first day of the riots and will continue until April next year.

In **Ealing**, small independent traders were given £1,200 each to help them pay for things like new glazing and repairs.

**Haringey** immediately began to coordinate activity which included the establishment of a dedicated 'Tottenham Business Advice Service' for residents and businesses affected by the riots to receive advice on housing, insurance, legal and business continuity. The Council has offered up to three months hardship relief exemption from business rates for businesses within the affected area.

**Wolverhampton** will be funding, under the High Street Support Scheme, £110,000 on security blinds; £45,000 on promotions for city centre (""700 reasons to shop in Wolverhampton"" campaign - referring to its 700 shops). They have also supported radio coverage and competitions for independent traders.

### Notes to editors

1. The package of support announced on 11 August for businesses affected by the public disorder included:

  * **A £10m Recovery Fund** to help councils with the immediate costs of making their areas safe, clear and clean again. Funding can be used, for example, to clear debris left strewn in streets and make immediate repairs to pavements and roads. This Recovery scheme can also be used to support councils who use their powers to offer council tax discounts or **council tax relief** to those whose homes have been damaged but are still habitable. Local Authorities can submit claims under this scheme up to 7 November.
  * **A £20m High Street Support Scheme** - funded jointly by the Departments for Communities and Local Government, and Business, Innovation and Skills, for the streets and areas where businesses were affected by the rioting. The money is intended to finance those measures that will get business trading again and meet short term costs. Councils are using funding to reduce business rates, finance building repairs and encourage customers back to the affected areas. **The payment deadline to businesses has been extended from 5 October 2011 to 3 January 2012. The Local Authority claims deadline for costs under the scheme has also been extended from 7 November 2011 to 31 January 2012.**
  * Councils have the power to offer business **rate relief for local firms**, but must pay a quarter of the cost; central government automatically pays for three quarters of the cost. The High Street Support Scheme will help reimburse councils for this cost, to facilitate immediate and real financial help to be given to local firms to rebuild their businesses. Business rates are typically the third biggest outgoing for firms after rent and staff.
  * In addition, seriously damaged homes and business properties were able to be taken off the respective valuation lists. The Communities Secretary strongly encouraged the Valuation Office Agency and local authorities to do so as promptly as possible. **This removes any liability for council tax or business rates.**

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2020114,Pickles to cut red tape that stops the public from flying flags,"Eric Pickles today announced proposals to make it easier for people to fly flags of their choice without facing costly restrictions and red tape. The moves are intended to boost England's local and national identities and strengthen community cohesion.

Proposals set out today will allow a much wider range of flags to be flown without the need for planning permission. Under current planning rules, only a select few flags are allowed to be flown without express permission from town hall officials. Getting this approval can incur fees of up to £335. Under the new rules, people will be able to fly a much wider range of flags including the flags of football and cricket clubs or town and village flags.

The Coalition Government will also make it easier for communities wanting to celebrate the contribution of our armed forces by easing rules on flying local regimental flags. Other local flags, and projects like environmental awards, could also all be freed up from existing bureaucratic restrictions.

The document published today will give details about proposed changes to regulations governing which flags can be flown without planning permission. If you have any views on this please send them by email to: [cyril.kearney@communities.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:cyril.kearney@communities.gsi.gov.uk).

Mr Pickles said:

> ""If people want to celebrate something that is important to them by flying a flag they should be able to do so without having to fill in forms or paying town hall officials for the privilege. We will make it easier for people to celebrate their allegiance to a cause, a county or a local organisation if they choose to do so.""

General Secretary of the Flag Institute, Charles Ashburner said:

> ""Flags are important to all UK societies and social groups. They are emotive symbols of unity, revolution, sport, tribalism, protest, patriotism and pride. In our super fast world of instant news and ever changing technology flags nevertheless remain the ultimate symbol of identity. I therefore welcome these proposals as potentially the most significant review of flag regulations in a generation.
> 
> ""Eric Pickles surprised and delighted the Flag Institute when he announced, at our Spring Meeting, his intention to liberalise flag flying in the UK. Today's launch makes good on that promise and takes an important step towards encouraging and protecting the huge variety of different community and individual identities of which British society should be so proud.
> 
> ""The deregulation of flag flying regulations in the UK is something which everyone who believes in freedom of expression should support.""

Andrew Rosindell MP, Chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Flags and Heraldry Committee said:

> ""The Flags and Heraldry Committee welcomes this consultation by DCLG to relax the rules on flags. Flags are an important part of our national and local identities and the freedom to fly them is essential to our sense of community and patriotism. We thank the Flag Institute for the extensive work they have put into developing this document.""

### Notes to editors

1. Currently the only flags allowed to be flown without consent are any country's national flag; the European Union; the United Nations; the flag of the Commonwealth; the flag of any English county; and the flag of a patron saint which can be displayed only in the county with which the saint is associated.

2. Other flags can be flown with deemed consent. These are a person or organisation's own flag or one advertising an event taking place in the building it is being flown from. These flags must be flown from a vertical flagpole on the roof of the building. Military flags will still need the permission of the relevant body (such as regiment) before being flown.

3. The Department's approach is to extend the categories of flags that may be flown either without consent or with deemed consent. Any flags outside these categories will continue to be prohibited without express consent.

4. Flags are deemed to be advertisements and their display is therefore controlled by the Town and Country Planning (Control of Advertisements) (England) Regulations 2007 (SI 2007 No. 783). Certain flags can be flown without consent (see Schedule 1 Class H) and others can be flown with deemed consent (see Schedule 3 Class 7A). The difference is that deemed consent can be discontinued or restricted in certain circumstances.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6 January 2012
http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2027139,Grant Shapps highlights support for struggling homeowners,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today reassured anxious homeowners struggling to pay their mortgages of the wide range of support available to help them keep their homes, and ensure that repossession remains the last resort.

Latest figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders show the number of homes taken into possession to be largely unchanged, increasing by one per cent on the previous quarter to 9,200.

In light of this, the Council of Mortgage Lenders expects the number of repossessions in 2011 to be lower than their original forecast of 40,000.

The Minister made clear that just as the Government is providing help for people wanting to get on the property ladder, a range of support is also available to keep them in their homes and avoid the threat of repossession.

The Directgov website - [www.direct.gov.uk/mortgages](http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/HomeAndCommunity/BuyingAndSellingYourHome/Mortgagesandrepossessions/index.htm) (external link) - has lots of free advice and information to homeowners struggling to keep up with mortgage payments and worried about the threat of losing their homes. Helpful advice is also on hand from organisations such as Citizens Advice, Shelter and the National Debtline.

And over the next two years the Government is investing more than £200 million into the Mortgage Rescue scheme. The scheme, available through local authorities, is designed to offer a last resort to the most vulnerable families to avoid repossession.  
    
The Minister argued that the most important thing the Government is doing to help those struggling with their mortgages is to tackle the national deficit and prevent the need for rapid increases in interest rates.

Housing Minster Grant Shapps said:

> ""Owning a home is an aspiration for many people. But just as we are helping people to get onto the property ladder we are also committed to ensuring advice, information and real practical support is available to help ensure that even in tough times people are helped to stay on the property ladder and that repossession remains the last resort.   
   
""Our homes are our havens and with so much at stake it's easy to see why sometimes people bury their heads in the sand and ignore their mortgage worries. But by tackling the problem early, speaking to their lenders and taking advantage of the free advice and information available from the Directgov website as well as organisations such as Citizens Advice, Shelter and the National Debtline homeowners can regain control and get in the best possible position to keep their homes.  
   
""For our part the Government will continue to tackle the record deficit and avoid the need for rapid interest rate rises, keeping the pressure off homeowners feeling the pinch.""

### Notes to editors

1. Anyone struggling with their mortgage can go to the [Directgov website](http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/HomeAndCommunity/BuyingAndSellingYourHome/Mortgagesandrepossessions/index.htm) (external link) for advice on getting their finances back on track.  
2. Separate figures from the Ministry of Justice show that mortgage possession claims have fallen over the past three months by two per cent, and claims leading to an order between July and September were four per cent lower than in the same period last year. Of the first orders made in mortgage possession claims, 49 per cent were suspended.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10 November 2011
http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2028954,Plans for a second year's council tax freeze set out,"We know households are facing difficult times so we're helping keep living costs down with a second year's council tax freeze, Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said today, as new scheme details were published.

Estimates of the Government grant boost that every council in England would receive if they commit to holding or reducing average Band D council tax for a second year were published today.

This follows the announcement that Government has set aside an extra £805 million, of which up to £675 million will be available to local authorities in England to help keep council tax down for a further year.

This new support builds on the 2011-12 freeze offer taken up by all councils, boosting what they could get over four years to £3.3 billion if they hold council tax for a second year. The new scheme would mean that local taxpayers living in an average Band D home in England could once again save up to £72 compared to a 5 per cent rise in council tax on top of this year's council tax saving of up to £72.

The new voluntary scheme will be open to the same councils as last year. Councils that freeze or reduce their council tax next year will get a one off grant equivalent to raising their council tax by 2.5 per cent. Police, and single purpose fire and rescue authorities will get a 3 per cent equivalent, with the Greater London Authority and the City of London getting intermediate offers.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""Last year every council signed up to our council tax freeze, but with many families still facing difficult times we're rolling over our successful scheme so councils can keep a lid on bills for another year.
> 
> ""Our two-year freeze promise, potentially worth up to £72 each year to Band D residents, is in stark contrast to the years before when council tax was allowed to double.
> 
> ""Today every local authority can see how we'll back them to hold council tax steady for another year and leave millions of taxpayers with more of their hard earned cash in their pockets.""

### Notes to editors

1. Council tax bills hit £1,439 on Band D in England in 2010-11. This year, 2011-12, the average Band D bill set by local authorities remained at £1,439. In London it was £1,308; in metropolitan areas it was £1,399; and in shire areas it was £1,484. Council tax was £688 in 1997-98. This means council tax has risen over one hundred per cent - or an extra £751 a year on a Band D home. Since all other Bands are set as a percentage of Band D, homes in every band have seen their bills double.

2. The value of saving for taxpayers by area from two years of the council tax freeze scheme compared to a five per cent rise can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/documents/newsroom/1786823/2028892.xls](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/newsroom/1786823/2028892.xls).

3. To help local authorities with their budget planning, we have published an estimate of the grant each participating authority would receive. Grants will be finalised in March 2012 once authorities have reported the tax base underpinning their calculation of council tax for 2012 13. A further £675 million will go to help local authorities in England freeze their council tax next year on top of this year's freeze. Of this, the London offer of around £100 million is based on a 2.5 per cent increase for Borough councils, a combined percentage increase of 3 per cent and 2.75 per cent for the Greater London Authority and of 2.75 per cent for the City of London. Details of for each area can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/documents/newsroom/1786823/2028905.xls](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/newsroom/1786823/2028905.xls).

4. The scheme for 2012-13 will comprise a one-off payment of grant, which is payable for one year only. The Localism Bill proposes to give the public the right to veto excessive council tax rises. Councils that set council tax increase above a ceiling approved by Parliament each year would automatically trigger a referendum of all registered local electors in their area: [www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1658293](http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1658293).

5. The scheme will be voluntary; and will apply separately to each billing and major precepting authority in England (including police and fire and rescue authorities) rather than to each council tax bill issued. Local precepting authorities, such as town and parish councils, will not be included in the scheme, but the Government urges them to exercise restraint and help make sure no council tax payer faces an increased bill. The Devolved Administrations will receive Barnett consequentials for this additional spending.

6. Assuming that all authorities take up the offer to freeze or reduce their council tax in 2012-13, we estimate Government will provide £3.3 billion of grant over the Spending Review period. A breakdown of the funding for each area can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/documents/newsroom/1786823/2028914.xls](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/newsroom/1786823/2028914.xls).

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,14 November 2011
http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2033731,New strategy to deliver homes and strengthen the economy,"An ambitious new strategy to tackle the housing shortage, boost the economy, create jobs and give people the opportunity to get on the housing ladder was announced today (21 November 2011) by the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister.

The Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister said the Government has inherited a broken housing market and a devastating collapse in construction from the era of top down targets, but new plans will give the housing market a shot in the arm by boosting supply, easing financial pressures and helping with demand. The action we take will drive up the level of housebuilding, ensure we are helping new home owners and boost consumer confidence.

The Strategy will break the current cycle in which lenders won't lend, builders can't build and buyers can't buy. We'll be making it easier for people to secure mortgages on new homes, help people get on the property ladder, address unfairness in social housing and ensure homes that have been left empty for years are lived in once again.

### Help for home buyers

At the heart of the strategy is a new build indemnity scheme that will give a helping hand for up to 100,000 prospective buyers who are currently frozen out of the housing market because of the need for large deposits.

Under the proposals, homebuyers will be able to secure loans on newly built homes - the bedrock of the first time buyer market - with only a five per cent deposit.

The Government and housebuilders will help provide security for the loan, so if the house is then sold for less than the outstanding mortgage total the lender will be able to recover its loss.

Through the scheme lenders will be encouraged to offer mortgages with smaller deposits, increasing demand for new homes and giving a welcome boost to the housing market.  
   
The Government will also consult shortly on proposals to increase discounts under the Right to Buy, giving social tenants the opportunity to buy the homes they live in. The discount will be improved dramatically and will be up to half the value of the home, making home ownership ever more achievable.

For the first time, the receipts from additional Right to Buy sales will be used to support the funding of new affordable homes for rent on a 'one for one' basis, which is expected to deliver up to 100,000 new homes and support 200,000 jobs.

### Help for housebuilders

Assistance for people buying homes will be matched by support for the people who build them, from the largest housebuilder to people who want to build their own homes.

Affordable housing providers are in line to share almost £1.8bn cash to develop new affordable homes. The first £1bn worth of contracts  under the Affordable Homes Programme  have just been confirmed, putting the Government on track to deliver up to 170,000 new affordable homes across the country over the next four years.

The Government will give more support for local areas that want to deliver new, larger-scale developments that meet the needs of their growing communities. A new prospectus will be published shortly inviting councils and communities to identify opportunities for locally planned large scale development, which will take advantage of streamlined planning processes, giving communities a stronger say and developers greater certainty.

The new plots could vary in size, from a small expansion of a few hundred homes through to a new market town with up to 10,000 homes. Viable schemes that are sustainable and have strong local support will be given financial assistance to get the work going, and will be prioritised for future infrastructure spending.

Where there are existing building sites that have stalled, a £400m Get Britain Building funding pot will enable housebuilders to restart construction, helping to deliver up to 16,000 new homes on sites that already have planning permission, but have been shut down because of economic conditions.

The new support on offer will also benefit self builders, an industry often assumed to be out of reach for some, but one that is increasingly popular and already worth £3.6 billion for the national economy. We are announcing £30 million additional funding to support provision of short term project finance on a repayable basis.

Councils will receive support to work with local people and bring forward plans for larger custom-built housing projects, similar to the successful project in Almere in the Netherlands.

All these measures will be supported through the New Homes Bonus, which will ensure that those areas which are growing have the resources to meet the needs of their new residents and existing communities.

### Improving fairness in social housing

Efforts to boost the supply of new homes and help homebuyers will be matched by improving fairness for those living in social homes.

Measures in the strategy will support the radical programme of reform to the system for social housing that is already underway. The Government will consult on 'Pay to Stay' proposals. This will mean that those social tenants on high salaries, such as household incomes of over £100,000 a year, will pay up to market rents if they want to continue living in taxpayer-subsidised homes.

Councils will be given new powers to reject applications for social housing from people who own a perfectly acceptable home of their own. And there will be stronger measures to help tackle the outrage of 50,000 unlawfully-occupied social homes - with a more detailed consultation to be published later this year.

The overly bureaucratic and complex model of council housing finance will be scrapped too so councils can manage their social housing stock more effectively.

Instead of the revenue generated from social housing being handed over to central Government and redistributed, councils will be able to keep their own receipts, giving them freedom to maintain their housing stock with more efficiency and transparency, in a way that meets local needs.

### Support for the private rented sector

The Strategy will also support greater investment in the private rented sector, a sector which accounts for around 16 per cent of all households.  
Large scale investment will be driven through changes to the tax rules affecting bulk purchases of buy-to-let homes, as well as through measures to encourage the growth of Real Estate Investment Trusts - the globally recognised model for real estate investment that provides low cost access to capital.

An independent review will also consider whether there are barriers to greater large-scale investment in rented housing.

### Action on empty homes

The Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister said that the fact that for years so little has been done to bring the nation's empty homes back into use is a ""national scandal"". Tackling the 700,000 empty homes across the country is a top priority in the strategy, and a key feature in the drive to increase the provision of affordable housing.

Housing Associations and councils will be able to apply for part of £100m of Government funding to bring empty homes that blight neighbourhoods back into use. The money will be used for innovative housing schemes that will ensure empty properties that ruin neighbourhoods are lived in once again, communities are regenerated and at the same time more affordable housing is provided. Government is also announcing £50 million of further funding to tackle some of the worst concentrations of empty homes.

The schemes will be backed by cash rewards through the New Homes Bonus for councils bringing empty homes back into use, and many schemes will also have wider benefits such as providing excellent training opportunities for local people.

The Government is also consulting on plans to allow councils local discretion to introduce a council tax premium on homes in their area that have been empty for more than two years, to provide a stronger incentive for empty homes' owners to bring them back into use.

### Supporting older people to live independently

The Strategy also focuses on the needs of older people and includes a deal to improve the quality and choice of housing available for older people, which aims to help them to stay independent for longer.

Nearly a third of all homes are occupied by the elderly, and nearly two thirds of the projected increase in the number of households over the next twenty years will be headed by someone aged 65 or over.

So a package of measures will help the elderly adapt their homes, or move into alternative housing, to meet their changing needs. As part of this package the Government will work to develop simple and attractive financial products that help older home owners safely release equity that they can then use to maintain or adapt their homes.

Other reforms set out in the strategy include:

  * transferring housing and planning powers from central government to councils and local people, so that they can shape development in their areas
  * replacing top down targets with powerful cash incentives through the New Homes Bonus, so instead of simply feeling the strain that new building projects place on existing services, communities have a reason to support new development
  * supporting private sector growth by reducing regulation and other burdens on house-builders
  * accelerating the release of public sector land with capacity to build up to 100,000 new homes by 2015, and support up to 200,000 construction and related jobs during development.

### Notes to editors

Laying the Foundations: a housing strategy for England can be found at: [http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/housingstrategy2011](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/housingstrategy2011)

Using previously-developed land owned by the public sector to deliver new homes could support as many as 200,000 construction and related jobs, 50,000 in every year of the spending review period.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,21 November 2011
http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2034246,New Build Indemnity Scheme,"The Prime Minister has today (21 November 2011) announced that the Government will provide a guarantee for up to 100,000 new mortgages at up to 95 per cent loan to value for new build properties in England. The scheme will be led by the Home Builders Federation and Council of Mortgage Lenders.

The new build indemnity scheme will deliver both a significant increase in housing supply, and access to affordable mortgages for those without large savings who wish to purchase a new home.

The scheme will be open to all builders and all lenders operating in England who wish to participate. The scheme will apply to all new build properties, both houses and flats, and will be available to all potential buyers, subject to appropriate underwriting criteria. Mortgages will be available under the scheme from March 2012.

The Government can confirm today that the following major lenders have agreed in principle to participate in the scheme: Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, Nationwide, RBS, Santander and Yorkshire and Clydesdale Banks.

These lenders make up over 80 per cent of mortgage lending in the UK.

The Government can also confirm that over 25 home-builders have agreed in principle to participate in the scheme, including the three largest Barratt, Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey (full list at end).

These house builders provide over 60 per cent of new homes in the UK.   

The Government hopes that other lenders and builders will also want to participate in the scheme.

### Detail

Borrowers will now have access to mortgages of up to 95 per cent loan to value at affordable rates on new build homes from participating builders.

The scheme will be available to all potential buyers, except buy-to-let investors or second home owners.

The process for agreeing these mortgages will be the same as for any other mortgage. From the borrower's perspective, this is a 'normal' mortgage, with no equity loans or second charges.

For each new build property sold under the scheme, the home builder will contribute 3.5 per cent into an indemnity fund, with the Government supporting the fund to a total of 9 per cent of the property value.

The indemnity fund pays out to the lender if a property financed under the scheme is repossessed and there is a shortfall. Builders will take the first loss in the indemnity, with Government only being called upon to pay once the builder's fund has been exhausted.

Lenders and builders will retain the right to decide which builders and lenders they wish to engage with, according to their own commercial judgements.

The Government will establish a delivery group of lenders, builders and Government to meet on a regular basis to monitor the practical implementation of the scheme.

There will be a cap on the value of properties eligible for inclusion in the scheme.

The scheme will be delivered by the Department for Communities and Local Government and will be available in England only.

The Government will conduct an evaluation of the scheme after two years, to ensure that there has been an appropriate and positive effect on the demand and supply of new build properties.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2040922,"Andrew Stunell: Rural councils ""need to think outside the box"" to deliver homes on the farm","Communities Minister Andrew Stunell has today called on farmers and rural councils to ""think outside the box"" to deliver more affordable housing.

The average house price in rural areas is £250,000, yet the average salary is only £21,000 a year, meaning many local people struggle to get on the housing ladder. Mr Stunell wants to see farmers identify disused farm buildings that could be converted into new affordable homes for local people, and wants councils to look favourably on their planning applications.

Mr Stunell highlighted a scheme run by Harrogate Borough Council that requires developers to make provision on the site for affordable housing, resulting in 34 extra affordable homes across 19 sites.

Mr Stunell believes that other rural councils can learn from Harrogate's example, and wants to see other councils work with their communities to deliver the homes they need.

Harrogate's approach is in the spirit of the ""Home on the Farm"" idea, championed by Mr Stunell, which promotes conversion of disused farm buildings into new homes.

Andrew Stunell said:

> ""Councils and rural communities need to think innovatively and outside the box to make sure they deliver the homes they need.
> 
> ""The work by Harrogate Borough Council shows what can be done when a local authority thinks imaginatively about its affordable housing needs, and uses all the powers they have at their disposal.
> 
> ""And with the measures announced in the Housing Strategy, the New Homes Bonus, FirstBuy, plus Neighbourhood Plans on the way from April 2012, the Coalition is making sure that councils have even more tools to get the job done.
> 
> ""I'd like to congratulate Harrogate, and call on other rural councils to look at their example, and see what else they can do to work with local farmers and their communities to convert their disused buildings and deliver a home on the farm.""

Councillor Jean Butterfield, Cabinet Member for Housing, said:

> ""This is the most practical way of implementing the rural building conversion policy so that we can help bring redundant buildings back into use as much-needed homes. Barn conversions can make extremely large high-value houses. Our policy encourages a more flexible way of looking at these buildings, creating more types and size of house including affordable homes for local people.
> 
> ""A total of 34 affordable homes associated with rural building conversions have been delivered on 19 sites and we currently have four more under way. Every rural affordable home added to our stock is desperately needed and helps local people to stay in communities where they work or where they grew up.""

### Notes to editors

1. Harrogate Borough Council's Discounted Home Ownership scheme allows the purchaser to buy at a discount of 65 per cent of the market value which is then protected in perpetuity.

2. As an example, Wilstrop Lodge Farm built two large units at market value and two smaller, affordable units. The market value homes sold for £500,000. The affordable homes sold at the discounted sale price of £60,000.

3. The average rural house price is now £250,000 and the average salary only £21,000.

4. Separately, the Government has announced as part of the Autumn statement, that it intends to consult on proposals to allow existing agricultural buildings to be used for other business purposes, such as offices, leisure and retail space, to make it easier for rural business to find the premises they need to expand.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2044644,Minister pledges to abolish 'digital apartheid',"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today pledged to end a 'digital apartheid' that has meant many social tenants in England are unable to get online.

Sobering estimates suggest nearly half of council and housing association tenants in England, including some of the most vulnerable people in our communities, do not have access to the internet or have never gone online. People in online households can save more than £200 a year shopping online and are 25 per cent more likely to find work, while children with internet access achieve two grades higher than those without - so it's clear that many low income households are missing out.

Chairing the 'Digital by Default' summit today with UK Digital Champion Martha Lane Fox, the Minister said that internet access should be a necessity, not a luxury. He will also say that Government is committed to getting social housing connected so tenants can reap the benefits of digital living, from access to online shopping bargains and job-hunting; to moving home through 'HomeSwap Direct' to be closer to a new job, family, or to a property better suited to their needs; and more.

Ministers, landlords and social tenants' representatives at the housing summit discussed:

  * how to drive down the cost for social tenants to get online in their homes, including possibilities for a 'Digital Deal' along the lines of the Green Deal
  * ensuring that social tenants have the opportunity to use the internet and see the benefits firsthand
  * encouraging providers to consider internet access as a 'best practice' service and to ensure that new affordable rent homes are built broadband ready
  * whether broadband could become part of the standard affordable rent package; and
  * options for providing access to the right technology to get online.

The Minister also called on social housing providers to look hard at what more they could do themselves to get their tenants online. Social landlords can save up to £340 million in communications costs alone by providing their tenants with the means to report repairs or pay rent online.

Race Online's new Digital by Default casebook, which shows how innovative thinking and partnership working can improve the lives of both landlords and tenants, offers plenty of inspiration:

  * Sunderland City Council, which has some of the highest levels of deprivation in the UK, has helped get the local community online by establishing 'electronic village halls' across the city. Centres now exist in village halls, youth clubs, schools, health centres, libraries, pubs, and communal areas in tower blocks social housing estates. The programme has 200 community e-champions to provide face-to-face support and inspiration.
  * All 800 residents in two London Peabody estates have been given internet access in a three-year Wi-Fi pilot. At least half of the residents are now using the service - many through smartphones - and a laptop loan scheme is available for those who can't afford one.
  * The Hyde Group has joined forces with volunteers from Eco Computer Systems who refurbish and recycle computers for local people to buy at reduced cost. Almost 200 PCs and laptops have been sold with 200 more orders on the way, saving residents around £200,000.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""In a country where the majority of people can apply for a job or even just buy a loaf of bread at the click of a button, it's no longer acceptable that so many of the most vulnerable people in our society are deprived of something most of us now take for granted in our daily lives.
> 
> ""I'm calling on every social landlord to look long and hard at how they can help their tenants get online, from offering networks of public internet cafes to providing the technology to log on at home.
> 
> ""Internet connectivity is considered by many to be the fourth essential utility, and should be a necessity, not a luxury. Government is committed to helping demolish this unacceptable digital divide that is blocking social mobility for millions of council tenants.""

This reappointment follows approval by Parliament of a statutory instrument to formally restructure of the Board of the Corporation which came into force on 17 November 2011. The Order reduced the size of the Board from 13 including Chair and Deputy Chair, to nine. Six of the remaining seats on the Board are reserved for the four local authorities, giving them a majority of seats on the Board.

Andrew Stunell said:

> ""The West Northamptonshire Development Corporation has started the last phase of its work where it has the important role of delivering some key local development projects and also becoming a more locally based body.
> 
> ""The process for change has already begun with restructuring of the Board to make it more locally accountable and the return of the first phase of statutory planning powers to the local authorities in April 2011. The full return of planning powers will be completed in April 2012, subject to parliamentary approval.
> 
> ""The Corporation will focus on using its statutory powers to take forward five key projects in Northampton which should then transfer to a local authority vehicle for completion at the end of 2013/14. Strong leadership will be vital during this period of transition and I am delighted to announce the reappointment of John Markham as Chair to lead the Corporation as it drives forward this important work.""

John Markham, Chair of the West Northamptonshire Development Corporation, said:

> ""I'm very pleased to be leading the Corporation during this highly important and exciting time for West Northamptonshire. The area represents one of the UK's best opportunities for attracting new jobs and private investment.
> 
> ""Since being established, West Northamptonshire Development Corporation has invested around £80 million in regeneration projects across West Northamptonshire. A considerable amount of progress has already been made, with projects ranging from Northampton's Becket's Park Marina to Daventry's iCon Innovation Centre already making a positive impact on the area.
> 
> ""However, there's a lot more to be achieved and the Corporation has a vital role to play over coming years. Working in partnership with the local authorities, we will continue to progress a range of regeneration schemes, including the redevelopment of Northampton' Grosvenor Centre, Railway Station and Waterside area.""

The West Northamptonshire Development Corporation was established in 2004 to drive forward regeneration, improved infrastructure, investment and sustainable growth in the towns of Northampton, Daventry and Towcester. The Public Bodies Review announced in October that the corporation would be devolved into a local authority led delivery vehicle based on proposals to be submitted by the local authorities.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2056449,14 areas get 2012 starter gun to 'pool and save' billions,"Fourteen areas are to pioneer a public service revolution that will slash financial red tape and duplication so they respond to local need and save taxpayers' millions, Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles announced today.

The revolutionary funding strategy known as 'Community Budgets' will let councils, boroughs or neighbourhoods team up with all public services in their patch to combine resources into a single locally coordinated 'pool and save' pot with greater local control of improved services for local people.

Early research showed that a saving of as little as a two percent equates to over £1bn and this approach has the potential to save up to twenty per cent in some areas.

Mr Pickles is clear the scale of public deficit means the country can no longer afford to leave public service investment in uncoordinated Whitehall silos. He believes this 'silo control' has created unequal access to services that are inefficient and unnecessarily expensive.

By removing Central Government mandates over how public money is spent locally and giving local professionals the power to combine budgets and coordinate local services using the best local intelligence, large swathes of red tape can be slashed and millions of pounds can be saved.

Four showcase areas, twice as many as first planned, have been selected today to run a Community Budget next year focusing on 'ways to create local growth and reduce dependency on the state'. Billions could be shifted into single budget pots to test how a local set up could deliver more efficient services.

  * **Cheshire West and Chester** will look at how to pool a single budget of between £3-4bn from over 150 local services;
  * **Greater Manchester** aims to use joined up local investment to reduce levels of dependency and to help create 50,000 jobs in the next four years;
  * **West London** will focus on skills and training for over 16s, speeding up family courts, and curbing youth violence and anti-social behaviour;
  * **Essex** will pull together a single set of objectives for the £10.4 billion they spend on public services so it is used more effectively and efficiently.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""We can no longer afford the luxury which left public investment idling to no purpose. We need a gear change that makes 'silo control' obsolete and starts a local service revolution that puts people at the heart of spending decisions and saves money.
> 
> ""We're setting up more Community Budgets than originally intended -these 'pool and save' pioneers can bring about truly local services with one big local cheque that knocks out bureaucratic processes everywhere and upends Whitehall's monopoly over public money that's hemmed in frontline workers for decades.""

The intention to select Community budget pilots was first announced by the Deputy Prime Minister in June as the second part of a major 'resource review' to overhaul council funding and boost local finances. Earlier this week plans were set out, alongside a new Local Government Finance Bill, to let councils keep a share of the business rates they collect rather than returning it to Whitehall.

Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg said:

> ""The government is overseeing a fundamental shift in the way Whitehall works - putting power firmly in the hands of local people.
> 
> ""Community budgets will give professionals the clout to control how money is spent in their communities.
> 
> ""They will put local authorities in the driving seat to deliver better services, cut red tape and save millions of pounds of taxpayers' money.""

The pilots will create a joint team with local partners, aided by Government officials and the Local Government Association, to establish their devolved budget proposals with decision making structures for a locally run operation during 2012. This will help achieve significant public sector savings, cut red tape and improve policy making.

Ten 'neighbourhood level' areas have also been selected to develop smaller scale Community Budgets that will give residents a micro-local level say over the services they want and use. The local community will play a leading role, working with councils and professionals, to shape local services so they work from a customer's perspective.

A package of support will be agreed with each of the following ten pilot areas:

Cowgate, Kenton Bar and Montague in **Newcastle**; **White City**, **Kingston**, **Poplar**, **Queens Park in London**; Ilfracombe in **North Devon**; **Bradford Trident**; Sherwood in **Tunbridge Wells**; **Haverhill**; and Castle Vale, Shard End and Balsall Heath in **Birmingham**.

Steve Wyler, Chief Executive of Locality, said:

> ""We very much welcome this announcement and support government driving budgets down to neighbourhood level. Persistent problems which afflict communities can be addressed by putting an end to the bureaucratic nonsense of spending silos so that local people, with all their local insights, can be in the driving seat.  We hope that this approach will be rolled out quickly across the whole country.""

### Notes to editor

1. More details on the four 'Whole-Place' Community Budget Pilot plans:

  * **Greater Manchester** aims to use joint investment from a range of partners to reduce levels of dependency and support growth critical to creating 56,000 private sector jobs over the next four years. They will use local evidence to decide how best to address cross cutting priorities like unemployment, low skills and dependency to support early intervention. This will result in a greater efficiency and public spending savings.
  * **Cheshire West and Chester** plan to review over 150 local services that have the potential to pool a single budget of £3-4 billion. They will make neighbourhoods safer and cleaner. Create new opportunities for jobs and learning as part of a 'better deal' for unemployed people. A first class children's centre will be at the heart of the community plus help for older residents to lead independent lives.
  * **West London** - Hammersmith & Fulham, Kensington & Chelsea, and Westminster - have put together a 'Tri-Government Guarantee', setting out their targets these include making sure every young person under 25 has a job or is in training or education; 80 per cert of children across the three boroughs achieve five A*-C grade GCSEs; access to high-quality affordable housing. The pilot will involve radically redesigning services and aligning funding in a number of key areas over the next 12 months.
  * **Essex** will encourage residents to play a greater role in their community and in helping to shape good value public services. Any savings delivered could be reinvested back into prevention and early intervention, not handed back to the Treasury. Local priorities include health and social care, skills for young people, economic growth and community safety.

2. More details on the Neighbourhood level Community Budget Plans:

  * Hammersmith & Fulham (White City) want to integrate neighbourhood service budgets including welfare, crime, social care and 'clean/green'.
  * Tower Hamlets (Poplar Harca) want their neighbourhood services to include support for local enterprise with more spent on services than bureaucracy.
  * Bradford Trident will co-commission parish functions, health and unemployment services with youth and sports centres run by a social enterprise.
  * Tunbridge Wells (Sherwood) aims to devolve all appropriate service funding to the neighbourhood.
  * Kingston (Norbiton) will extend Local Integrated Services to all neighbourhood funds looking at housing, policing and community engagement.
  * Haverhill will devolve a pooled budget to the 'One Haverhill' partnership. This will embed local knowledge and community influence over services.
  * Birmingham (Balshall Heath, Shard End, Castle Vale) want the pilots to become a catalyst for more pooled budgets focused on prevention. Balsall Heath Forum and Shard End will be community led approaches while Castle Vale Community Partnership will be housing association led.
  * Westminster (Queens Park) will create a Recovery and Early Action Partnership to bring all relevant services and residents in the neighbourhood together to focus on families at risk.
  * Ilfracombe (North Devon DC) will create shadow accounts in ""Virtual bank"" as the first step to co-commissioning, before moving to budgetary control. It will look at neighbourhood services, libraries and highways.
  * Newcastle (Cowgate, Kenton Bar, Montague) will broker agreements so ward committees can invest in family-support services delivered by a community enterprise.

3. A Challenge and Learning Network will be set up to share learning from the pilots with other areas. The Network will help drive the Community Budget agenda forward helping make sure they are ambitious, sustainable and capable of being replicated elsewhere. Fourteen councils will sit on the network: Birmingham; Blackburn with Darwen Borough; Cornwall; Durham; Hertfordshire; Lincolnshire; Greenwich; Harrow; Sheffield; Shropshire; Sunderland City; Swindon; Wiltshire; and Worcestershire.

4. A Community Budgets Prospectus was issued on 17 October 2011 inviting councils to submit expressions of interest to pilot Community Budgets across the whole of a local authority area and also at a neighbourhood level. It set out how pilots would be shortlisted, then selected and includes details of the offer made to pilots: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/communitybudgetspropspectus](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/communitybudgetspropspectus).

5. Community Budgets were announced as part of the Spending Review 2010 (see [www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1748116](http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/corporate/1748111)).

6. Detail of the Local Government Resource Review Terms of Reference (phase two: Community Budgets) are available at: [www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/pdf/1933423.pdf](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/pdf/1933423.pdf) (PDF, 43 kb).

7. Locality is a leading network of over 650 community-led organizations. It helps local people to set up and run local organisations for the benefit of their communities.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2057825,Grant Shapps: Funding boost towards national No Second Night Out pledge,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has hailed the first steps toward a national network of homelessness support as £8 million grant funding was allocated to communities across the country to help them adopt London's flagship 'No Second Night Out' initiative.  
  
Mr Shapps recently announced plans to establish a single new national phone line and website so that people across the country will know where to go and who to call to get help for rough sleepers in their area.  
  
London's No Second Night Out pilot, introduced by the Mayor, works with members of the public to quickly identify people sleeping rough in the capital and provides them with the accommodation and support they need to get themselves off the streets.  
  
The Minister said this £8 million allocation will help local communities get the services in place to support a national roll-out of the scheme, helping to ensure that nobody across the country will be forced to sleep on the streets for more than one night.  
  
Welcoming the news, Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""When economic times are tough, protecting the most vulnerable in society becomes even more important.  
  
""That's why we have dedicated £8 million to extend No Second Night Out outside the capital and make sure that anyone who finds themselves on the streets quickly gets the help they need.  
  
""A safe, warm place to stay is something that everyone should be able to rely on, so I'm delighted that 19 more areas will each receive this cash boost to help make sure that no-one will need to spend more than one night sleeping rough.""

Nineteen communities across England are to get up to £250,000 each, delivered through the £20 million Homelessness Transition Fund, which was set up to help support the national rough sleeping strategy, [Vision to end rough sleeping: No Second Night Out nationwide](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/visionendroughsleeping).  
  
Commenting, Sharon Allen, Chair of the Fund's Grants Panel said:

> ""In these difficult times, the funding announced today will help charities provide the vital support that many homeless people need to get back on their feet.  
  
""The quality of applications and demand for help was extremely high. However, I am pleased that these grants will help protect essential services and develop new, more effective ways to stop people living on our streets.""

Charities in the following areas are receiving funding to adopt No Second Night Out:

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2059194,Councils still have healthy reserves for 2012-13,"One year into the Spending Review period, the latest figures show that due to good budget management the majority of councils have not yet had to dig deep into their £10 billion reserves.

Overall, English local authorities expect to be holding £10.8 billion in reserves on 31 March 2012. At the same time last year, their forecasts for 31 March 2011 totalled £11 billion.

All councils should keep sufficient sums of money in reserve so that they have a financial cushion to meet sudden unexpected costs.

Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""All told, councils still have over £10 billion held in reserve to fall back on.
> 
> ""Most councils have maintained significant reserves, which will give them room to manoeuvre on their finances in future years, and help them to support budgets, and deliver efficient local services.""

### Notes to editors

  1. The reserves figures are from the Revenue Budget (RA) returns for 2010-11 and 2011-12 provided by local authorities to the Department. The full list of council reserves is available at: [www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/xls/2059155](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/xls/2059155)
  2. Determining the level and use of reserves is a matter for individual local authorities, taking into account local challenges and priorities. There is no prescriptive national guidance on the minimum or maximum level of reserves, either as an absolute amount or as a percentage of the budget.
  3. Reserves are either: a) earmarked, as a result of a policy decision by a local authority to use them for specific purposes (it should be noted that some earmarked reserves have to be set aside for specific purposes under statute); or b) unallocated, these reserves are part of a local authority's risk management process, which would be called upon in the event of unexpected costs and emergencies.
  4. A recent report by the Audit Commission found that this year the vast majority of councils have sound financial management and are strongly placed to manage funding reductions. Further, the Audit Commission found that, on average, single tier county councils held unallocated reserves equivalent to two-thirds of their grant reductions. District councils held unallocated reserves of twice the value of their reduction. If earmarked reserves were included, district reserves were six times the value of their reduction, and, for county councils, nearly three times.
  5. Source data for the councils' reserves table is from the Revenue Budget (RA) 2010-11 2011-12 as sent to DCLG by local authorities.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2067038,England's major cities to decide own mayoral powers,"Elected city mayors will have their own bespoke powers tailored to local needs, Minister for Cities Greg Clark announced today.

Rather than seeking to impose a 'one size fits all' approach, the Government will take advantage of the new power in the Localism Act to devolve power to mayors through negotiating a bespoke city deal with each city.

The Government's approach for bespoke, locally tailored powers for city mayors was confirmed as the right way forward, following the ""What can a mayor do for your city?"" consultation.

The Coalition Agreement set out the Government's commitment to create directly elected mayors in England's 12 largest cities outside of London, if backed by local electors in a referendum and following full scrutiny by elected councillors.

Referendums will take place in May 3 in 11 cities - Birmingham, Bradford, Bristol, Coventry, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle upon Tyne, Nottingham, Sheffield and Wakefield. Leicester has recently elected a mayor.

Where a mayor is elected, cities will be expected to come forward with proposals for the powers and services they want decentralised and handed to their city mayor. Evidence from London and beyond shows the difference elected mayors can make. They can provide strong and visible leadership, and take the decisions needed to attract jobs and investment for the future.

Cities Minister Greg Clark said:

> ""Each one of our great cities is unique, with different needs, characteristics and ambitions. The Localism Act allows the Government to devolve the powers to any city that the city requests and that is the approach that we will take to new mayors.
> 
> ""A bespoke approach to each city is consistent with the approach set out in 'Unlocking Growth in Cities' which the Government published before Christmas, and the consultation has endorsed this approach.""

Communities Minister Baroness Hanham said:

> ""Our cities should have the best leadership possible to help them flourish and as we've seen in London and other cities, an elected mayor can make a real difference in attracting jobs and investment and tackling difficult decisions head on.
> 
> ""Ensuring elected mayors will have a set of powers that are tailored to local need will put our cities in a stronger position to step up and take on local challenges quickly, and help them thrive in the future.""

Ensuring cities can have their say on the powers their mayor should have is in line with the Government's recent announcement on tailoring 'city deals' with England's eight core cities. These deals will consist of new powers for cities so they are in the strongest possible position to support private sector growth.

But in return for these new 'city deal' powers and freedoms Government is asking for reassurances in a number of areas including leadership and accountability. Cities will need to show strong, visible, accountable leaders who provide vision and direction. Evidence suggests that the democratic mandate provided by directly elected mayors is one way to provide strong and proactive leadership.

### Notes to editors

1. The Government was responding to the consultation ""What can a mayor do for your city?"" which ended on 3 January 2012.

2. The Government received 58 responses to the consultation. Responses were received from city councils, parish councils, chambers of commerce, public bodies and members of the public.

3. A 2004 survey showed that 57 per cent of the public could name their elected mayor from a prompt list, compared to just a quarter who could name their council leader - Randle, A (2004) Mayors in mid-term: lessons from the eighteen months of directly-elected mayors.

4. The Coalition Agreement set out a commitment to creating directly elected mayors in the 12 largest English cities outside London subject to confirmatory referenda. The Localism Act gives areas the right to have an elected Mayor. Mayoral referendums will be held on the local Election Day (for the majority of cities) in May 2012.

5. If a city votes in favour of having a mayor at its referendum, that city will then rapidly hold an election for its first mayor. Mayors would be elected for four year terms.

6. The proposals relate solely to the 12 cities, and Mayors elected in other places would not be affected by them.

7. The Written Ministerial Statement is available here: [www.communities.gov.uk/statements/newsroom/2066653](http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/newsroom/2066653).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2069772,Eric Pickles sees family intervention in action in Devon,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles saw efforts to turn around troubled families when he visited two Family Intervention Projects in Devon today, alongside the head of the new Troubled Families Team, Louise Casey.

Mr Pickles and Ms Casey toured the Edge of Care Family Intervention Project in Torbay and the Green Ark Children's Centre in Plymouth meeting both key workers and families. The two centres were praised as excellent examples of early-intervention work aiming to tackle troubled families.![Eric Pickles and Louise Casey visit a community centre in Devon](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2071067)

Mr Pickles and Ms Casey heard from Plymouth and Torbay councils directly about the best methods for how central and local government can work together in tackling troubled families together in the future.

The visit is part of a determined drive by the Government to turn around the lives of 120,000 of the country's troubled families. Last month the Prime Minister and Mr Pickles launched the strategy and announced nearly half a billion pounds of funding to help local authorities achieve success.

Troubled families cost society nearly £9 billion every year with most of that spent just to contain and respond to problems such as crime and anti-social behaviour, or placing children into care.

The excellent work being done in Plymouth and Torbay will help inform the work of the Troubled Families Team as they draw up plans to work with other councils across the country.

Whilst on the visit, Mr Pickles and Ms Casey also heard from the families involved and discussed what other measures would be useful in helping them turn their lives around.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""The Government is committed to transforming the lives of these troubled families and I've seen today the good work local authorities are already doing. We want to achieve real results and the work of the Troubled Families Team will build on the success of what is taking place in Torbay and Plymouth.""

Louise Casey said:

> ""Troubled families are families that both have problems and can cause problems. Last year around £75,000 per family was spent largely on dealing with the problems these families can create. But now across the country we have to take action that gets to the causes and really helps get families back on track. It's a huge challenge and I'm delighted with the response I've received so far from people willing to work together to make real and lasting change.""

### Notes to editors

1) In December 2011, Prime Minister David Cameron and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles announced £450 million plans to radically transform the lives of the country's most troubled families. A new Troubled Families Team based within the Department for Communities and Local Government and headed by Louise Casey, has been established to join up efforts across Whitehall, provide expert help to local areas and drive forward the strategy.

2) £448 million will be made available to the Troubled Families Team to turn around the lives of 120,000 families over the next three years. Most of this money will follow a payment by results model, which equates to up to 40 per cent of the money needed to turn round families. The remaining 60 per cent will be found from across the budgets of a range of local bodies.

3) The government will also fund a national network of Troubled Family 'Trouble-shooters' in each (upper-tier) local council. The trouble-shooters will operate at a senior level to oversee the programme of action in their area - getting a grip on the numbers, bringing together police, job centre plus, health organisations, schools) to put a robust plan of action in place to deal with the families and ensuring the right action is being taken with each family and levering in resources for their local programme.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2072118,Smart app to help defuse fire danger,"Electrical Fire Safety Week - 23rd -29th January 2012

As shocking statistics show that half of all accidental house fires were caused by faulty or misused electrical equipment in 2010/11, the Fire Kills campaign is highlighting a smartphone app from the Electrical Safety Council which will help people defuse the danger in their homes.

From faulty fridges and forgotten irons, to overloaded plugs and dodgy wiring - electrical equipment can be an unnoticed fire hazard in the home.  And with the recent cold weather, many sockets could still be overloaded with additional space heaters and electric blankets.

In 2010-11, accidental fires in the home caused by faulty or misused electrical products resulted in nearly 40 deaths across the country. As part of Electrical Fire Safety Week - 23 - 29 January - we're asking people to look around their homes, identify all the potential risks and take extra care when using electricity.

The Electrical Safety Council's app helps people identify risks in their home and offers advice on resolving them.

The Government's Chief Fire and Rescue Adviser Sir Ken Knight said:

> ""Electrical equipment is an inescapable part of all our lives, from essentials like heating and lights to luxuries like entertainment systems or beauty products. Half of all accidental fires begin with an electrical appliance, so it's really important to be sure that your electrics are in good working order and are used properly.
> 
> ""Most electrical fires start in the kitchen, so be extra careful with cooking equipment. Fire in the home can be devastating, but many of these fires are preventable. By following some simple steps, you can help keep you and your loved ones safe from fire.""

Lorraine Carney Senior Campaigns Manager at the Electrical Safety Council said:

> ""With electricity such an integral part of our lives it is understandable that people tend to take it for granted. But that doesn't mean we can forget basic safety precautions. There is a worrying gap between the public's perception of electrical danger and the reality, with people making simple yet potentially fatal errors that can be easily prevented""
> 
> ""The ESC's free 'Home Electrical Safety Check' app was designed to bridge that gap. We wanted to create something which people would find simple to use and hope that they will download it, check their homes and take corrective action"".

Every individual can take steps to help themselves by checking that the electrical equipment they use everyday is in good shape and is operated properly:

  * Don't overload plug sockets
  * Regularly check for worn or frayed wires
  * Unplug appliances when not in use
  * Keep appliances clean and in good working order
  * Consider using a Residual Current Device which works like a circuit breaker to protect against electric shocks and reduces the risk of electrical fires.

The Electrical Safety Council advises that heaters should be kept clear from curtains and furniture and should never be used for drying clothes. Your electric blanket should be unplugged before you go to bed, unless it has a thermostat for safe all-night use.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2073781,Election date announced for cities that say 'yes' to mayors,"The Government's commitment to people power and local democracy took another step forward today as Cities Minister Greg Clark announced the date for mayoral elections.  
   
Ballot boxes in the cities that say 'yes' to mayors will open on 15 November 2012, giving local people the power to decide who their first mayor should be.

In May 2010, the Coalition set out its commitment to creating directly elected mayors in the 12 largest English cities outside London, subject to confirmatory referendums and full scrutiny by elected councillors.

Referendums will take place on 3 May 2012 in 11 cities - Birmingham, Bradford, Bristol, Coventry, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle upon Tyne, Nottingham, Sheffield and Wakefield. Leicester already has an elected Mayor.

Directly elected mayors mark another shift in the landmark transfer of powers from Whitehall back to communities, letting local people decide what is best for their area. The Government believes that elected mayors can provide the strong, democratically accountable leadership to maximise the potential for economic growth and investment in cities bringing real benefits for residents and businesses.

Cities Minister Greg Clark said:

> ""Elected mayors provide cities with the strong, visible leadership that can help them prosper nationally and internationally. This is an opportunity for each city to transform itself for the better.
> 
> ""The world's great cities have mayors who lead for their city on the national and international stage, attracting investment and jobs. We believe that mayors can help English cities achieve their full potential too.
> 
> ""This May, the people of our cities will have the chance to have their say. Now is the time to start weighing up what a mayor could do for your city.""

The legal foundation for the role of directly elected mayors is the Government's Localism Act, which contains a wide range of decentralising measures. Mayors will have a crucial role to play in shaping the ongoing process of reform - negotiating with Ministers to specify and secure the specific powers that each community needs to prosper.

### Notes to Editors

1.  The Coalition Agreement set out a commitment to create directly elected mayors in the 12 largest English cities outside London, subject to confirmatory referendums and full scrutiny by elected councillors. The Localism Act empowers local people to decide whether they want an elected mayor for their city. Mayoral referendums are being held on local Election Day on 3 May 2012. Leicester has recently elected a Mayor. Bristol will hold their next local election in 2013 and Nottingham will hold theirs in 2015.

2. If a city votes in favour of having a mayor at its referendum, that city will then hold an election for its first mayor on 15 November 2012. Mayors would be elected for four year terms.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2082140,Grant Shapps: Bid to become a Portas Pilot,"Struggling towns and cities across England are being handed the chance to breathe new life into their ailing high streets, Grant Shapps has announced today.

![Illustration of a high street](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2082239.jpg)Illustration by Dermott Flynn

Mary Portas and the Local Government Minister launched a competition to choose 12 towns to become 'Portas Pilots', with the winners benefiting from a share of £1 million to help turn around their ""unloved and unused"" high streets.

Mr Shapps has offered the cash incentive to those towns that come up with the best High Street blueprints in a move that fulfils the first and last recommendations of Mary Portas' High Streets Review, commissioned by the Prime Minister and published before Christmas.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""Our high streets have faced stiff competition from Internet shopping, and out-of-town shopping centres - leaving them underused, unloved and under-valued. The Internet is not going to go away, and so for our high streets to survive they need to offer something new and exciting.
> 
> ""So today I'm offering a golden ticket to 12 town centres across the country to become 'Portas Pilots' - areas with the vision and enthusiasm to breathe new life into what should be the beating heart of their communities, and they will get Mary's and my support as they try out the ideas in her recent review.""

Mary Portas said:

> ""I am thrilled that now there is an opportunity to turn my recommendations into reality by giving communities across the country the opportunity to come forward with their vision for breathing new life into their locality. I hope my Review has inspired people with another vision of tomorrow where our high streets are re-imagined as destinations for socializing, culture, well being, learning as well as shopping. I want the first twelve Town Teams to challenge the old ways of working, experiment, take risks and reaffirm their place at the heart of a community. A place we all want to be and can be proud of.""

Taking forward the first recommendation from Mary Portas's review, the 12 successful localities will create Town Teams, made up of the key players in their local community - such as the council, local landlords, shopkeepers and the local MP.

These teams will then benefit from the backing of the Minister, Whitehall and Mary Portas herself as they take forward the recommendations from the review and in their area. They will also receive a share of £1 million.

Grant Shapps added:

> ""I want to see how these Town Teams plan to try new things, experiment and ensure that their high streets and parades become destinations for local people want to be. But these pilots are just the start. We want to learn their lessons and help communities across the country breathe new life into their own towns. Launching this competition now is a signal of our understanding that there's no time to waste in driving forward these important measures.""

Mr Shapps will give the full Government response to the review by the Spring.

Successful bidders will need to demonstrate how they have the energy, enthusiasm and vision to make a real difference to their town centres and make them the hubs of their communities.

Areas will need to demonstrate how they plan to breathe new life into their high streets and shopping parades, but not just in a staid application form - Mr Shapps would also like to see their pitches to become Portas Pilots in short YouTube clips.

### Notes to editors

1. We are looking for pilots areas with a transformational vision for their high street and the backing to make it a reality. The lead partner should be able to clearly articulate this vision and demonstrate strong support for it from the local community and a wide range of local partners. The bids will need to show:

  * A **mix** of pilot areas: from a variety of town centres and high streets including market towns, villages, large towns, new towns, coastal towns and suburban areas. We also want to ensure a good geographical spread, as well as areas with both high/low average income levels  and high/low empty shop vacancy rates.

  * **Commitment**: we are looking for bids to demonstrate maximum commitment to the town team approach.

  * **Potential for improvement**: resources will be allocated on a value for money basis and therefore areas must be able to demonstrate their potential for improvement; and

  * **Innovation**: bidders are asked to provide an outline of what the key priorities for their pilot area will be. We are looking for the most innovative ideas **and evidence of strong leadership** that will have maximum impact and can be replicated elsewhere.

2. _The Portas Review: An independent review into the future of our High Streets_ was published on 13 December 2011: [www.communities.gov.uk/portasreview](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/regeneration/portasreview). The Review made ambitious recommendations on what can be done - by Government, local authorities and business - to help high streets deliver something new. The focus is on putting the heart back into the centre of our high streets, re-imagined as exciting social hubs for shopping learning, socialising and having fun.

3. The recommendations of the Portas Review aim to:

  * **Get town centres running like businesses**: by strengthening the management of high streets through new 'Town Teams', developing the Business Improvement District model and encouraging new markets
  * **Get the basics right to allow businesses to flourish**: by looking at how the business rate system could better support small businesses and independent retailers, encouraging affordable town centre car parking and looking at further opportunities to remove red tape on the high street
  * **Level the playing field**: by ensuring a strong town centre first approach in planning and encouraging large retailers to show their support for high streets
  * **Define landlords' roles and responsibilities**: by looking at disincentives for landlords leaving properties vacant and empowering local authorities to step in when landlords are negligent; and
  * **Give communities a greater say**: by greater inclusion of the high street in neighbourhood planning and councils using their new discretionary powers to give business rate concessions to new local businesses.

4. The prospectus and application form are available here: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/regeneration/portaspilotsprospectus/](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/regeneration/portaspilotsprospectus).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2093814,Grant Shapps: Over half of London's rough sleepers now non-UK nationals,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today warned aspiring Dick Whittingtons from across the continent not to come to London before making firm plans, with figures showing that more than half the capital's rough sleepers come from overseas.

Grant Shapps issued his warning alongside a pledge of £18.5 million to provide advice and information for those at risk of homelessness.

It comes as the latest statistics for England published today show the number of people sleeping rough increased by 23 per cent since last year.

Separate data from across the capital shows that of all the rough sleepers in London, more than half now come from overseas. Mr Shapps said that the rising number of rough sleepers from Central and Eastern Europe in particular are putting extra pressure on homelessness services and acknowledged the excellent work being led by the Mayor's London Delivery Board on rough sleeping to tackle the problem through the No Second Night Out initiative.

To address this growing problem, Mr Shapps is backing a new campaign by London's Passage Day Centre to help make Eastern European citizens aware of the realities of moving to England to look for work before they pack their bags.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Non UK residents now account for over half the rough sleepers in our capital, so anyone heading here with tales of Dick Whittington in their head needs to realise that the streets of London and our other cities aren't paved with gold. Those arriving from beyond our shores to try and carve out a future in England should come with a thought-through plan to avoid the risk of sleeping on the streets.""

The Government and the Greater London Authority are also working closely with foreign embassies to minimise the problem, with embassies making it easier for rough sleepers to get the documents they need and providing advice and assistance to their citizens in both the UK and in their home countries.

Mr Shapps made clear however that this country provides some of the best support for rough sleepers in the world. Every country has different methods for counting rough sleepers, but with fewer than 450 rough sleepers in London compared to reports of up to 2,500 in New York and 5,000 in Paris, he said that the capital was dealing with the issue more effectively than many other cities internationally.

Today's rough sleeping figures are the second annual release since the Government overhauled the way councils conduct counts in their area. All councils are now required to provide a robust estimate or count of those sleeping rough in their area - in order to give a clearer picture of the scale of the problem across the country, and bringing the total national figures much higher than under the previous, voluntary system.

The Minister also confirmed £18.5 million for councils to help tackle and prevent rough sleeping among single people, ensuring that nobody is turned away without clear and useful advice when they are most in need. This comes on top of the existing £400 million grant this Government has protected for preventing homelessness.

The Minister also challenged local authorities across the country to follow the example of Merseyside, whose new commitment to ensure no-one spends a second night on the street is helping many people in the local area improving the chance they won't return.

Mr Shapps added:

> ""This country has some of the best homelessness services for those who become destitute in the world, but rough sleeping is still on the rise, and I want to make sure we're doing everything we can to prevent anyone spending a second night on the street.
> 
> ""Today I'm investing over £18 million to ensure that everyone has the advice and information they need to avoid homelessness. And with Liverpool now signed up to adopt the potentially life-saving 'No Second Night Out' commitment pioneered in London and other major cities making plans, in future no-one should ever spend more than one night on the streets.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2100330,"Grant Shapps: ""apprenticeships in the home"" for tenants","Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today offered wannabe decorators and carpenters the opportunity to become ""an apprentice in the home"" - and get paid to hone their skills.

Under the Tenant Cashback Scheme, responsible residents will have the chance to tackle everyday DIY dilemmas like leaky taps, fitting doors and painting and decorating.

Those who sign up to the scheme could not only receive cash for their efforts - those who get a taste for DIY could also get on the career ladder with the opportunity of basic training programmes to help them develop their skills even further.

Mr Shapps said the Tenant Cashback scheme offers the opportunity:

  * **For tenants to earn extra cash** - up to £500 a year for those who sign up and agree to undertake minor repairs in their homes; and
  * **For communities to come together to take on repairs for their area**, pooling their money to improve the local area and help neighbours who can't do the work themselves

Today, the Minister met with councils and housing associations across the country, and urged them not to deny their tenants the opportunity for a fulfilling career - which could start in the comfort of their own homes.

Some landlords are already leading the way. These include:

  * **Home Group** - Social tenants in Coulby Newham, Durham, Braintree, Essex and Cumbria are being offered tailored DIY courses at a B&Q training centre to support them in carrying out their own repairs;
  * **Bromford Group** - Dudley, Lichfield, Cotswold, Stratford residents receive one to one advice on maintaining their homes and tenants have provided videos with hints and to help their neighbours get started; and
  * **Together Group** - Residents are all receiving basic DIY training, with wider support offered around developing a CV and employment opportunities.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Rather than having to wait for landlords to act, tenants should be able to tackle their own DIY dilemmas and get paid for it.
> 
> ""Tenant Cashback offers just that opportunity, with as much as £500 a year available to residents who sign up to tackle such minor repairs as leaky taps and decorating. And for some, this could even serve as an apprenticeship in the home and the start on a path to a whole new career.
> 
> ""This, combined with the potential to bring the local community together to improve the local area, means all councils and housing associations should give residents the right to take up tools through this new scheme.""

### Notes to editors

1. Social housing landlords are responsible for more than four million homes, and spend an average of £1,000 per property annually on repairs.

2. Tenant Cashback allows residents to take more control of their repairs budgets for their homes, for example, by carrying out their own DIY or commissioning it locally - allowing them to pocket any savings made which can then be used as they see fit, such as towards the deposit on their own house.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2111760,Securing the future of the Fire Service College,"Fire and Rescue Minister Bob Neill has today announced the next steps in securing the future of the Fire Service College. Following a successful pre-market engagement exercise, the Fire Service College will be sold to a private sector company to continue operating as a training centre.

To ensure best value for money for hard-pressed taxpayers and enable the College to continue in its role a number of conditions will be imposed on the proposed sale.  These include commitments that not only will the College be preserved as a national training college for the Fire and Rescue Service but that it will continue to offer wider national resilience and emergency services training and exercises.

Bob Neill said:

> ""The Fire Service College is an asset of national importance, with a world-class reputation and it is vital that we secure its future.
> 
> ""My decision means that the private sector will be able to bring innovation and investment to the College, benefiting taxpayers, local residents, the Fire and Rescue Service and, ultimately, strengthening national resilience.
> 
> ""I know there is real excitement about this opportunity out there in the market and I look forward to seeing some strong bids when the process opens.""

### Notes to editors

1. The Fire Service College is a trading fund and executive agency of the Department for Communities and Local Government. Since becoming a trading fund in 1992, it has never been able to pay a dividend out of operating profits. This situation cannot persist and the Government's response to Fire Futures on 12 April 2011 concluded that the College could achieve its full potential only if there was greater involvement from other sectors in its ownership, operation and governance.

2. The Future Options project considered four options for the future of the College:

  * The status quo: the College remains as a trading fund of the Department
  * A Government Owned Contractor Operated model: the assets remain under Government ownership but management of the College is taken over by a private sector company under a long term contract, together with the staff
  * Disposal as a going concern: the College is sold to a private sector company who would continue to operate the College as a training centre
  * Closure: the College's activities cease, staff are made redundant and the site is sold for an alternative use.

Analysis of the four options showed disposal as a going concern to be the best option. It is the only option which both fully removes from Government the ongoing financial risks of ownership of the College and preserves a national training college for the Fire and Rescue Service.

3. A pre-market engagement exercise has been conducted to invite the views of external partners and to assess the level of private sector interest in the College. There has been real interest in this solution and we expect the College to go to market in early April 2012.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2120120,Grant Shapps offers 'Portas-Plus' plan to revive ailing high streets,"Towns across the country have got their applications in ahead of today's deadline in the hope of becoming Portas Pilots. Ministers revealed the unexpectedly high level of interest whilst announcing that the Government is accepting virtually all the recommendations put forward by Mary Portas last December.

The Government today is for the first time issuing its formal response to the Portas High Street Review. Grant Shapps confirmed Ministers are accepting the vast majority of Mary's recommendations - but that they intend to go further with a raft of new incentives, funding schemes and bureaucracy-busting measures, all in a bid to rejuvenate the country's rundown high streets.

  * [""Portas-Plus"" deal for High Streets - Transcript](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/newsroom/word/2120049.doc)

MS Word, 24 kb

In what Mr Shapps referred to as a 'Portas-Plus' response, a new package of help has been drawn up including:

  * A multi-million pound High Street Innovation Fund - kick started by £10 million of taxpayers money focussed on bringing empty shops back into use - which, if supplemented by both councils and landlords, could see £30 million going to support new business start-ups whilst bringing empty High Street properties back into use;
  * A £1 million Future High Street X-Fund, which will be awarded in a year's time to the locations which deliver the most creative and effective schemes to revitalise their high streets;
  * A National Markets Day, launching a National Markets Fortnight, to celebrate the role markets can play, help aspiring entrepreneurs try out their business ideas, and encourage more visitors to town centres;
  * A £500,000 fund for Business Improvement Districts, to help Town Centres access loans for their set-up costs; and
  * Launching a further round of Portas Pilots, to trial some of Mary's recommendations and come up with new ideas to breathe life into underused high streets. This is in response to the massive interest from hundreds of locations across the country, sparked by the competition for the first wave of 12 pilots launched last month.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""Today, I'm accepting virtually all of the recommendations from Mary Portas's review - but I'm also going that one step further, offering a 'Portas-Plus' deal, with a range of measures designed to help local people turn their high streets into the beating hearts of their communities once again.
> 
> ""Mary Portas's review made crystal clear the stark challenge our high streets face. With Internet shopping and out-of-town centres here to stay, they must offer something new if they are to entice visitors back.
> 
> ""Her report has provided the catalyst for change that many towns have been craving. I now want to see people coming together to form their own town teams and turning their creative ideas into reality to ensure their high streets thrive long into the future.""

Mary Portas said:

> ""When I published my Review I was clear that this was an action plan for our high streets, not a document to gather dust on Whitehall shelves.
> 
> ""I've been thrilled by the response of people, Town Teams and communities up and down the country, who have seized this opportunity to come together and form their own ideas. I'm pleased that the response from Grant Shapps today is designed to build on this momentum and give local people the tools they need to turn their creative ideas into reality, along with extra money to bring empty shops back into use.
> 
> ""Naturally I would have liked greater central intervention in critical areas such as change of use, parking, business rates and the sign off of new out of town developments and I will continue to fight for these, but I do believe that today marks the first day of a fresh new approach, putting our high streets firmly back on the public and national agenda.""  


Martin Blackwell, chief executive at the Association of Town Centre Management, said:

> ""We all recognise that the high street in 10 or even five years will be radically different to that we see today. This Government's approach, shown in the response to Mary's report, is giving local communities the opportunity to shape the future High Street they want to see in their town.""

British Retail Consortium Director of Business, Tom Ironside, said:

> ""We're pleased to note the Government's made a common sense decision not to seek to restrict consumer choice in other retail locations. Avoiding imposing an exceptional sign off for out of town developments is the right approach. We also welcome the money which has been made available to enable the development of Business Improvement Districts and the steps which are being taken to reduce red tape that affects the high street. These detailed measures will be beneficial.
> 
> ""Retailers retain their concerns in relation to the excessive burden of business rates and the need for concrete action to ensure affordability, clarity and certainty for the future. We hope the Government will return to this issue soon.""

Responding to the first recommendation in the review, Mr Shapps said he wanted to see hundreds of Town Teams - made up of key players in the local area including the council, local landlords, business owners and local MPs - being formed and mobilised across the country to drive forward the necessary change.

He encouraged these Town Teams to consider:

  * How their high streets can become the ""beating heart of the community"", offering more than just retail with entertainment venues and leisure facilities, as well as housing and local public services;

  * How they can work with councils to use the forthcoming new powers to offer local business rate discounts, and to ensure businesses are aware of the option to spread the payment of the retail price index increase in business rates bills over three years, giving them the flexibility to manage their bills and help their cash- flow. This is in addition to Small Business Rate Relief, which in England has been doubled for two and a half years, from 1 October 2010 to 31 March 2013;

  * How they could stimulate a vibrant evening economy by encouraging local shops to open later, offering a service to people as they come home from work, instead of people resorting to online shopping; and

  * How they could make more imaginative and exciting use of public spaces and remove street clutter to make town centres more pleasant for visitors.

And confirming the Government was accepting a number of other key recommendations to cut red tape and entice motorists to the town centre, Mr Shapps gave a commitment to:

  * Help councils revoke unnecessary and archaic byelaws through a new streamlined process - enabling  outdated rules hindering efforts to get new markets and businesses up and running to be swiftly scrapped;
  * Reform current planning rules to allow the conversion of space above shops to two flats, rather than the current limit of one; and
  * Consult on abolishing centrally-set minimum parking charges, to give councils the flexibility to levy lower parking penalty notices if they choose. The Government will also take steps to ensure greater transparency on parking charges to introduce greater competition between town centres.

4. Small Business Rate Relief in England has been doubled for two and a half years, from 1 October 2010 to 31 March 2013. Eligible businesses occupying property with a rateable value of up to £6,000 pay no rates for that period, with tapering relief up to a rateable value to £12,000. To make sure no small firm loses out the Localism Act has simplified the process for claiming the tax break to encourage take up by small businesses. More information is available here: [www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1972672](http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1972672).

5. In addition businesses will be able to defer payment of 3.2 per cent of their 2012-13 rates bills until 2013-14 and 2014-15. This will give businesses flexibility to manage their rates bills in the current economic climate, help their cashflow, and give them time to adjust to the impact of inflation. This means someone with a bill of a £10,000 could defer £320.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2122010,Andrew Stunell: New look energy advice will help homeowners save money on bills,"New-look Energy Performance Certificate to offer practical advice for improvements

Prospective homeowners will be given better and clearer advice on making their new homes more eco-friendly, Communities Minister Andrew Stunell announced today.

![Energy Performance Certificate](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2122024.jpg)New look certificate

The Minister unveiled a package of measures to make energy information on properties easier to understand, which if followed could help customers save money on their fuel bills.

A new-look Energy Performance Certificate will give homebuyers clearer information about the energy efficiency of their homes. Alongside the recommendations for improvements, the new certificates will indicate to the consumer whether they can be funded through the Green Deal.

And Domestic Energy Assessors, who compile the Energy Performance Certificates, will have undergone further training to ensure these documents are produced to a consistently high standard and assured advice is given to prospective homeowners.

Prospective buyers and tenants will also be given this energy information much earlier in the buying process, to give them time to plan how they will implement some of the recommendations included.

From April, these buyers will also be able to compare the energy performance of their home with that of similar properties, as the National Energy Performance Certificate Register is opened up to public use for the first time.

But to ensure the data is as secure as possible, companies wanting to use the Register will be required to sign a licensing agreement - which will include strict rules over how the data is used.

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""The Energy Performance Certificate has proved useful in putting the efficiency of our homes at the forefront of our minds, but homeowners can often struggle to know how to act on the advice it gives.
> 
> ""That's why we're giving it a complete redesign, making it clearer and easier to understand and putting the recommendations for improvements into matters of pounds and pence by showing how much consumers could potentially save on their energy bills.
> 
> ""And by making the national register of Energy Performance Certificates open to the public, each homeowner will for the first time be able to see how their property compares with others, and where changes could be made so their homes become as eco-friendly as possible.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2124333,Andrew Stunell: Tackling inequalities for Gypsy and Traveller communities,"Government commitments to tackle ingrained inequalities and promote fairness for Gypsy and Traveller communities were unveiled by Communities Minister Andrew Stunell in a report published today.

The progress report by the Ministerial working group on tackling inequalities experienced by Gypsies and Travellers contains 28 measures from across Government that will improve outcomes for Gypsies and Travellers across education, health, accommodation, employment and in the criminal justice system.

Gypsies and Travellers experience, some of the worst outcomes of any ethnic or social group including: below average educational attainment; above average rates of miscarriage, still births and neo-natal deaths; and widespread discrimination and hostility.

Ministers are determined to tackle these inequalities and improve the lives of the country's Gypsy and Traveller communities. In November 2010 the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, Eric Pickles set up a ministerial working group, bringing together seven Government departments, to examine the challenges faced by these communities and to make recommendations for action.

The report by the working group, published today, is an important step in making headway towards increasing equality for Traveller communities by helping mainstream services work better for Gypsies and Travellers. The commitments outlined in the report include:

  * piloting a 'virtual headteacher' who will champion the interests of Gypsy, Roma and Traveller pupils across their local authority and respond to issues of low attainment and attendance
  * promoting of improved health outcomes for Gypsies and Travellers within the proposed new structures of the NHS
  * work to build on our support for authorised sites that have the backing of the local community, through £60 million Traveller Pitch Funding and the New Homes Bonus to match monies raised through council tax. Both the settled and travelling communities will benefit from such an approach
  * improving knowledge of how Gypsies and Travellers engage with employment services
  * preventing hate crime, increasing reporting of incidents and challenging the attitudes that underpin it; and
  * ensuring access to appropriate rehabilitation activities in prison and on probation.

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""Fairness is one of the key values of the Government and this means everyone having the chance to do well irrespective of their background or their beginnings.
> 
> ""This report sets out how work across key Government departments will help tackle inequalities faced by Gypsies and Travellers and help improve the lives of those communities to the benefit of all.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2128286,George Clarke appointed empty homes adviser,"Architect to lead efforts to bring empty homes back into use

Architect and TV presenter George Clarke is to be an independent adviser to the Government to help bring thousands of empty homes back into use for families in need of stable, secure homes, Ministers announced today.

![George Clarke](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2129162.jpg)George Clarke to be Empty Homes Adviser

Although the numbers of empty homes have fallen to their lowest level since 2004, there are still 720,000 homes sitting empty across the country - with 280,000 left vacant for six months or more.

Ministers have already announced £150 million to bring empty homes back into use as affordable housing - including £50 million to tackle clusters of empty homes.

George Clarke presented Channel 4's recent series of programmes, The Great British Property Scandal. His work as independent adviser on empty homes will particularly involve:

  * promoting bringing empty homes back into use
  * raising public awareness of the benefits of bringing empty homes back into use and encouraging people to report empty homes in their area
  * encouraging councils, housing associations and voluntary groups to identify innovative and good ideas and sharing this across communities
  * challenging Government and other public bodies to ensure publicly-owned homes are not left empty; and
  * exploring whether current plans for demolition in councils could be scaled back.

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""I am delighted that George Clarke has agreed to work with us as we pull out all the stops to end the national scandal of empty homes.
> 
> ""For every two families needing a home, there's a property standing empty - properties that, all too often, attract squatters, vandalism and fly-tipping. That's why over the past year, I've made £150 million available to bring these homes back into use.
> 
> ""George's appointment as our independent adviser on this issue will give these efforts a real boost, and I look forward to seeing how communities benefit from his help and advice, and seeing more families benefiting from a secure, stable home as more empty properties are brought back into use.""

Independent Empty Homes Adviser George Clarke said:

> ""There are hundreds of thousands of empty homes that could and should be saved from the bulldozers and refurbished.
> 
> ""I totally support the building of new homes when it's necessary but not when it's cheaper and quicker to refurbish empty homes than to build from scratch. It can be kinder to communities and the environment - and it makes sense in these tough economic times.
> 
> ""I care passionately about this subject and I'll leave no stone unturned in my efforts to find a solution to the problem and get these houses back into use for the families who need them.""

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""George Clarke has been a phenomenal campaigner against the scourge of Empty Homes. His popular Great British Property Scandal programme raised the issue up the agenda. I'm pleased to report that the number of empty homes has fallen in the two years since this government came to office. Now we hope to accelerate that work further with £150 million of investment and George Clarke as our Empty Homes Adviser.""

### Notes to editors

1. Ministers have made £150 million available to communities to bring empty homes back into use. This is comprised of:

  * £70 million for councils to bring over 5,600 empty homes back into use

  * £30 million for community groups; and

  * £50 million to tackle clusters of empty homes.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2128610,England's array of Enterprise Zones go operational,"The next generation of Enterprise Zones are now 'operational sites' with 'live deals' immediately available for aspiring new businesses, Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles announced today.

Every Enterprise Zone can now offer immediate tax breaks to businesses as soon as they move onto the site. The discount provides up to 100 per cent relief to new businesses for five years. Government is meeting the costs.

Each Zone is finalising ambitious simplified planning requirements for their sites. Many are using special locally developed planning regimes known as 'Local Development Orders' to grant automatic planning permission for certain development, such as new industrial buildings or a change to how existing buildings are used, within specified areas. This gives interested firms certainty about the development that will be allowed and removes the delays and costs associated with applying for planning permission.

Two thirds of the Zones will have at least one of these orders in place by the summer. Many of them will have multiple orders for their different sites. 18 orders have already been agreed, while eight more have completed the public consultation stage. A further 40 are in the pipeline.

Mr Pickles saw first hand how these planning changes are working on a visit to the Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft Enterprise Zone, where six orders are now in place.

The Secretary of State looked around a company that is expanding their premises into the Beacon Park Technology Park because of enterprise zone incentives including the simplified planning arrangements.

Seajacks is a leading operator of purpose built self-propelled jack-up vessels for offshore wind farms in the North Sea.

The orders in the Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft Enterprise Zone permit energy related development including new buildings, extensions, roads, telecommunications and low-carbon energy installations. All its sites will have superfast broadband by late 2012.

Six councils in the Sheffield City Region Enterprise Zone have today agreed a deal for a uniform and more 'business friendly' planning approach with quicker permissions expected. Global manufacturer, X:Cel Superturn, is using a new £18 million contract to rapidly expand its operation into the Zone.

The Zones are also attracting foreign investors, showing Britain is great for business. Just last week Japanese logistics firm Vantec, a subsidiary of Nissan, became the first overseas company to invest, £24 million, in an Enterprise Zone, taking advantage of Sunderland's Enhanced Capital Allowances.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""Local business and private sector commerce turn the wheels of our economy creating the jobs this country needs. This Government has set about fostering local enterprise and creating the conditions for businesses to thrive.
> 
> ""This week our low tax, low regulation, Enterprise Zones with superfast networks are going operational with live deals and incentives now available to entice new companies to the area.
> 
> ""We've planted these economic incubators all across the country to help accelerate growth, rebalance our economy with thousands of new businesses and local jobs in each location.
> 
> ""Enterprise Zones are set to become the crown jewels of how we make Britain the best place in the world to start and grow a business.""

The Budget 2011 announced that the Government would create a new generation of Enterprise Zones with simplified planning rules, super-fast broadband and tax breaks for businesses, would be established in local enterprise partnerships across England. The Zones have the potential to create tens of thousands of new jobs by 2015.

### Notes to editors

1. The business rates discount for businesses in Enterprise Zones went operational on 1 April 2012. The discount provides up to 100 per cent relief to new businesses with the sites for five years up to state aid de minimus levels. Authorities should now be providing the discounts using the new local discounts powers. Central Government is meeting the costs of the discount.

2. Great Yarmouth's local development orders enable development including: port and logistics related businesses, energy industries, electronic communications works, solar panels, site investigation works, offices, general industrial development, security cameras and wind turbines.

3. Local Development Order progress in the Enterprise Zones is as follows:

  * 18 orders have been agreed: six in Tees Valley, six in New Anglia Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft, one in West of England Temple Quarter (Bristol), one in Sheffield Modern Manufacturing and Technology Growth Area, one in Black Country i54 and Darlaston, one in Cornwall and Isles of Scilly Newquay Aerohub; one in South East Midlands Northampton Waterside, one in Lancashire and one in Leeds Lower Aire Valley

  * seven orders have completed consultation: one in Leeds Lower Aire Valley, one in Humber Estuary, one in New Anglia Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft, one in the Marches, Hereford, two in Greater Birmingham and Solihull City Centre and one in North Eastern River Tyne and Nissan site

  * approximately 40 further Local Development Orders are in preparation across the Enterprise Zones.

4. Other Enterprise Zones are making progress in different ways:

  * The North Eastern Enterprise Zone confirmed that the £24 million of investment from Vantec, an integrated logistics company, will include 417,000 sq feet of new building, which will be operational in less from a year from now and will create 240 new jobs as well as safeguarding 800 existing jobs.
  * Global manufacturer X:Cel Superturn is set to expand its operations in the Sheffield City Region Enterprise Zone after beating strong competition to win a major contract worth over £18 million to supply precision gaskets and sealing rings to a global subsea tree manufacturer.
  * In September 2011 Jaguar Land Rover announced it would build a £355 million engine plant on the i54 site - part of the Black Country Enterprise Zone. The first phase comprises 70,000sqm with a second expansion phase of around 65,000sqm. The plant will employ 750 staff and is due to be in operation by 2014.
  * The Enterprise Zones support Tees Valley's industries within the petro-chemical, renewable energy, advanced manufacturing and digital sectors helping create and support up to 1,200 jobs by 2015. Sites at Port Estates in Hartlepool, the New Energy and Technology Park in Billingham, as well as Wilton and PD Ports/South Bank Wharf (both in Redcar and Cleveland), can offer large-scale occupiers enhanced capital allowances against the cost of qualifying plant and machinery. Tees Valley are establishing their own locally funded Enterprise Zone sites to attract further investment in the area and support diversification of the local economy.
  * The Northampton Enterprise Zone will redevelop and regenerate a large area around Northampton station and along the River Nene. A planning application has now been submitted for a land-mark development on the site - a 3740sqm 'innovation cube' which will provide high quality accommodation for 60 start-up businesses.
  * The New Anglia local enterprise partnership has developed a 'soft landing' package to give targeted support to businesses locating in their Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft Enterprise Zone. This will include access to an energy sector support team; dedicated Inward Investment Director; access to key economic, cost and skills information; searches for suitable land and premises; introductions to supply chain partners; support from specialist energy sector knowledge hubs and access to UK Trade and Investment support. The Enterprise Zone covering six sites over 120 hectares will focus on offshore wind, port logistics and engineering. It is expected to create 80 businesses that would benefit from approximately £3.8 million in tax breaks.
  * The Greater Cambridge and Greater Peterborough Enterprise Zone - Alconbury Business Campus - will strengthen the manufacturing base across the partnership area, by encouraging ideas worked upon by scientists, academics and entrepreneurs to be produced locally rather that lost to overseas manufacturing. The Enterprise Zone will have a broad focus on ICT, bio-technology, pharmaceuticals, advanced manufacturing, creative industries, engineering and processing.
  * Across the board local enterprise partnerships are working with telecoms firms to make sure superfast broadband is the standard speed in Zones.

5. The Government has put forward a range of measures to develop Enterprise Zones and make them attractive places to do business.

  * A 100 per cent business rate discount worth up to £275,000 over a five year period (for businesses that move into an Enterprise Zone during the course of this Parliament).
  * All business rate growth generated by the Zone for a period of at least 25 years will be kept by that area.
  * Local Development Orders are available to local authorities to establish a simplified planning regime.
  * Government support to ensure that super fast broadband is rolled out throughout the Zones. This will be achieved through guaranteeing the most supportive planning environment and, if necessary, public funding.
  * The Government will make 100 per cent enhanced capital allowances available in the Black Country, Humber, Liverpool, North Eastern, Sheffield and Tees Valley Enterprise Zones to plant or machinery investment allowing them to write it down against taxable profits.

6. The following 24 Enterprise Zones now stretch across England:

Black Country i54 and Darlaston  
Cornwall and Isles of Scilly Newquay Aerohub  
Derby, Derbyshire, Nottingham and Nottinghamshire Boots Campus  
Greater Birmingham and Solihull City Centre

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2129178,Red tape holding back councils cut by more than a quarter,"The Government has reduced the amount of 'red tape' data collections it expects councils to send by over a quarter - giving them more time to focus on residents and local priorities, Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles announced today.

The new 2012-2013 list of the information councils are expected to report to central government, published today, shows a reduction in demands from 193 data collections last year to 156 this year.

The Government introduced the single comprehensive list of required data collection last year as a way to reduce the burden of top down demands.

Cracking down on pointless bureaucracy and freeing councils from regulatory burdens is a top priority. Since summer 2010 the Government has ended 56 separate data collections placed on local government and seriously scaled back a further 19. This builds on decisions to end over 4700 local government targets.

Councils, for example, no longer have to spend time and money, on sending in complex planning monitoring or completing a housing subsidy form three times year.

The Government has abolished an array of key bureaucratic burdens including the National Indicator Set; Local Area Agreements; the Comprehensive Area Assessment; the £5 million Place Survey and 66 pages of guidance on how to report efficiency.

Ministers are also putting in place a rigorous 'real time' gateway to prevent the build up of new data burdens on local government throughout the year. Councils will not have to provide anything that is not on the list unless funding is made available.

The Department continues to reduce the overall burden of regulation on businesses too. New measures in the Localism Act planning reforms will result in estimated benefits to businesses of £14 million per year.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""For too long central government has kept Town Halls hunched over desks crunching numbers or wielding clipboards asking the public intrusive questions.
> 
> ""We know councils are most effective when they are free to innovate and respond to what local people want without undue interference from Whitehall.
> 
> ""That is why we are chopping great chunks of pointless red tape out of the system - radically reducing the demands, burdens and restrictions put on Town Halls by central government. In next to no time at all we have scaled this back more than a quarter.
> 
> ""But we are not stopping there - business and communities deserve much less interference from government and we remain determined to push as hard as we can and crack down on unnecessary red tape and regulation anywhere we find it.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2131292,Local government ombudsman to champion residents' cause,"A Chairman and Vice Chairman Ombudsman who will lead a more customer-focused Commission that champions the rights of redress for local residents were appointed today.

Acting Chairman Dr Jane Martin has been designated as Chairman of the Commission for Local Administration in England and Anne Seex as Vice-Chairman. Both are already performing Local Government Ombudsman roles.

Creating a more streamlined Local Government Ombudsman will deliver a more cost effective organisation and make sure that the Ombudsman is well placed to provide services that support citizens' needs with a particular emphasis on consumer champions as envisaged in the Open Public Services White Paper.

The Minister for Local Government Grant Shapps said:

> ""I am delighted that Jane Martin and Ann Seex have taken up the task of leading the Local Government Ombudsman. I know they are determined to champion the rights of local residents.
> 
> ""The Local Government Ombudsman has a vital role to play in the community making sure people get swift and fair redress if things go wrong in the delivery of their local services.""

### Notes to editors

1. Dr Jane Martin was appointed to the post of Local Government Ombudsman and Vice-chair of the Commission for Local Administration in England in January 2010.  Since November 2010 she has been Acting Chair following the retirement of Sir Tony Redmond. She has extensive knowledge and experience of public service delivery. At the University of Birmingham and Warwick Business School she conducted research on public management and governance in the fields of education, health and local government. She has worked in local authorities across England as a consultant for the Improvement and Development Agency for Local Government (IDeA) and was the first Executive Director of the Centre for Public Scrutiny. Prior to joining Local Government Ombudsman she was Deputy Chief Executive at the Local Better Regulation Office and a Non-executive Director of Coventry Primary Care Trust.

2. Anne Seex was appointed to the Commission as the Local Government Ombudsman based at York in October 2005. She previously had over 25 years' experience in local government, joining the Commission from Norwich City Council where she had served as Chief Executive for five years. Anne's experience included 11 years in various roles in the Chief Executive's Department at Manchester City Council. She left Manchester to become Director of Community Services for Lancaster City Council where she was responsible for housing, leisure, environmental health, engineering and estates.

3. The Commission for Local Administration in England, (better known as the Local Government Ombudsman) is charged by Parliament with investigating complaints from individual citizens that have suffered injustice arising from maladministration by local authorities. The authorities that the Ombudsman has jurisdiction over are primarily local authorities, as well as education admissions appeal panels, fire and police authorities, the Greater London Authority and more recently schools and private adult care homes. The service is free at point of use.

The Ombudsman can recommend redress and remedial action where they determine there has been an injustice. In 2010-2011 the Commission investigated and decided over 10,792 complaints.

4. The Government has also given the commission permission to appoint a Chief Operating Officer who will take over the functions of Chief Executive and Accounting Officer as part of a more streamlined senior management. The creation of the Chief Operating Officer role does not result in an overall increase in the Commission's headcount.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2142678,Grant Shapps: Tackling record deficit has helped keep repossessions down,"The Government's commitment to tackling the record deficit is keeping interest rates at a record low and a secure roof over the heads of millions of hard-working homeowners, Housing Minister Grant Shapps said today.

The Minister spoke as latest figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders showed the number of repossessions unchanged from the same quarter last year. Today's figures show there were 9,600 repossessions during the first three months of 2012 - unchanged from the same quarter of 2011.

Mr Shapps said today's figures underlined how Government action was helping to head off the threat of far higher rates of home repossessions predicted by a leading academic three years ago.

In his report Professor John Muellbauer of Nuffield College, Oxford warned that at the extreme, repossessions could hit levels last seen in the 1990s - and even in more likely scenarios could hit as many as 60,000 a year.

But the Minister also stressed that while today's figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders were below these earlier predictions, there was no room for complacency and that the Government is determined to do all it can to prevent the trauma of repossession for hard-pressed households.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""No family that has worked hard to buy their own home should be left feeling like repossession is the only option - not when there is help and support on offer to ensure that it is only ever the last resort.
> 
> ""Thanks to our work to tackle the deficit, we've managed to keep interest rates at record lows, keeping pressure off hardworking homeowners, and meaning we're nowhere near the levels predicted only three years ago.
> 
> ""Even though figures today show that repossession levels are stable, now is not the time to rest on our laurels. Just as the Government is tackling the problem head on I would urge struggling homeowners to do the same - I would urge them to take action and take charge, get advice early and use the support on offer.""

Mr Shapps said that, just as he is committed to helping people onto the property ladder, he is also determined that for those who already own their own homes, real help and advice is on hand to keep people in their hard earned homes and ensure repossession remains a last resort.

This help includes:

  * A £20 million Preventing Repossession fund giving every council the opportunity to offer small interest free loans to struggling homeowners and ensure that court desks can offer on the day advice for those facing the prospect of repossession.

  * The Directgov website - [www.direct.gov.uk/mortgagehelp](http://www.direct.gov.uk/mortgagehelp) (external link) - which has lots of free advice and information. Helpful advice is also on hand from organisations including Citizens Advice and the National Debtline; and

  * The Mortgage Rescue Scheme, which has been refocused to deliver better value for money, with a reduction in the grant rate paid to housing associations and tighter caps on property prices and repair costs, to ensure as many people as possible can benefit from it. More than £200 million has been invested into the scheme, and is now available through councils and housing associations to ensure help is targeted at homeowners most likely to benefit from it.

### Notes to editors

1. The Council of Mortgage Lenders publish their repossessions figures today, which can be found at: [www.cml.org.uk/cml/media/press/3203](http://www.cml.org.uk/cml/media/press/3203) (external link).

2. Separate figures from the Ministry of Justice show that claims leading to a court order have fallen over the past three months by three per cent, and by 12 per cent compared with the same quarter of 2011. The total number of claims for mortgage possession by lenders between January and March this year were five per cent lower than the previous quarter, and 15 per cent lower than in the same quarter in 2011. Of the mortgage possession claims that led to orders in the first quarter of 2012, 50 per cent were suspended. These figures can be found at: [www.justice.gov.uk/statistics/civil-justice/mortgage-possession](http://www.justice.gov.uk/statistics/civil-justice/mortgage-possession) (external link).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2143332,Grant Shapps: £1.8m to tackle scandal of 'beds in sheds',"Minister pledges to 'flush out' criminal landlords

Criminal landlords trapping vulnerable people in 'suburban shanty-towns' will get the justice they deserve, Housing Minister Grant Shapps pledged today.

He allocated a £1.8 million fund to areas blighted by so-called 'beds in sheds', to tackle the problem head-on and end this growing practice by ruthless landlords.

Mr Shapps appealed to councils who may have turned a blind eye in the past to 'beds in sheds', to use this funding and the range of powers at their disposal, to tackle the issue.

'Beds in sheds' are often rented to migrants, including some with no right to be in the UK, at extortionate rates.

Their foreign 'tenants' often find it difficult to return home quickly after destroying their passports to avoid removal. With few other options, they will put up with cramped conditions, dodgy wiring and poor sanitation as an alternative to life on the streets.

Mr Shapps said that the £1.8 million fund would help the worst affected councils flush out those who exploit migrants at their most vulnerable. They are:

  * Brent
  * Ealing

> ""But this is just the start. Our national taskforce, including the police, councils, the UK Border Agency and HM Revenue and Customs are pooling their resources to bring the so-called landlords of 'beds in sheds' to justice. I want anyone stuck in these suburban shanty towns to know that help is at hand and they will not be abandoned.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/communities/1695699,Communities Minister commemorates the Abolition of the Slave Trade,"Communities Minister Andrew Stunell has taken part in a ceremony to mark the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade. The event, took place at the Liverpool International Slavery Museum, to promote understanding of the slave trade and the consequences being felt today.

![Children at the Liverpool International Slavery Museum.](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1695707)

Mr Stunell's speech emphasised the importance of addressing the challenges of modern day slavery, discrimination and disadvantage and the Government's commitment to tackling race inequality.

Mr Stunell said:

> ""Acceptance and understanding of our past is important in moving towards a future which is free of intolerance and racism.
> 
> ""The Government is committed to working to combat racial discrimination, as well as equality for all. We are also helping fight modern day slavery by addressing the root causes - poverty and inequality - in the developing world.""

Carnivals and performances are being held today in Bristol and London and will be followed by a programme of educational events throughout the year.

The Department for Communities and Local Government wants to break down the barriers that small voluntary and community organisations can face. The Minister will announce that workshops are to be held in the autumn which will help Black and Minority Ethnic-led organisations access funding for educational and heritage events (including those on the remembrance of slavery and the slave trade).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/communities/1730025,Andrew Stunell celebrates Big Society in action at Manchester Airport,"Communities Minister Andrew Stunell joined 100 volunteers from Manchester's Airport Community Network (ACN) to celebrate their achievements.

The Minister met with volunteers at the 'Impact 10' event at Manchester airport.

The ACN, now in its sixth year, is an initiative where on-site partners from Manchester airport get involved in community volunteering and support projects to improve the local area. This year alone they have given over 1000 hours in volunteer time. One of the many successful projects involves airport employees acting as mentors in local schools, helping students pass GCSE maths.

Mr Stunell said the scheme reflected many of the themes in the Big Society vision, and applauded volunteers for their commitment.

Mr Stunell said:

> ""The Big Society is not about dictating from Whitehall, it is about shifting control to the people and giving individuals and communities real power to implement positive change to their areas. Here in Manchester, the Airport Community Network have taken the initiative and demonstrated the real outcomes that come from working together.
> 
> ""I was delighted to be able to join in their celebrations and meet the people who have taken part, clocked up an amazing amount of volunteer hours and achieved so much to improve their local community. The Network is a great example of how people power can transform ideas into action. Everyone can be involved in building the Big Society and the volunteers here have shown how the community spirit and desire to get involved is very much alive.""

Julie Armstrong, Manchester Airport's HR Director, said:

> ""The aim of 'Impact 10' is to celebrate the projects that the ACN has been involved with and to try and inspire other companies and employees to get involved and show them how easy and how fun it can be. We wanted to encourage more active participation to get a feel for how the projects work and how the community and the volunteers develop as a result.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/communities/17420811,Eric Pickles pays tribute to curry entrepreneurs,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has praised the nation's top curry restaurants and promised to support the spice industry in going from strength to strength.

Speaking at the 2010 British Curry Awards, Mr Pickles paid tribute to the contribution that the spice industry makes to both the national economy and the local community.

Now in their sixth year, and a highlight of the gastronomic calendar, the British Curry Awards celebrates the best of Britain's favourite dishes and restaurants.

Mr Pickles said:

> ""Curry has a huge place in our national affections. The tikka masala is more British than fish and chips. And curry is big business as well as a great meal. The entrepreneurial spirit shown by those present is a real inspiration. The growth in the spice industry over recent years is a modern day success story and is testament to the hard work of those running these restaurants - as well as their cooking.""

Mr Pickles is a well known curry fan. Earlier this year, he was pictured in one of Birmingham's most popular curry restaurants, prompting a significant pay out by Ladbrokes bookmakers.

Reflecting on the Prime Minister's visit to India earlier this year, Mr Pickles stressed the importance of building up strong economic and cultural links with India. Closer to home, he promised to work constructively with the industry on all the relevant issues - from skills and small business rate relief to bin collections.

The awards, organised by Enam and Justine Ali, took place at Grosvenor House. There were 3500 different restaurants who received more than 67,000 nominations from listeners to LBC radio and viewers of STAR TV and ITN. The winners were chosen by food critics, journalists and celebrity chefs.

There are now 12,000 Indian restaurants all over the UK and Ireland with an annual turnover of £4.2 billion yearly and directly employing around 100,000 people. The event was raising funds for the Help a London Child fund.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/communities/1759026,Voluntary sector at the heart of public service reform,"Ministers have pledged swift action to open up new opportunities for the voluntary sector to help deliver public services as part of the Big Society.

Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark joined Paymaster General Francis Maude and Civil Society Minister Nick Hurd for a No11 Downing Street summit with voluntary sector leaders. They discussed plans for a Green Paper to address how to create a level playing field for charities, voluntary groups and social enterprises to bid for public service contracts.

Mr Clark added that the upcoming Localism Bill will devolve power from the centre, empowering people and organisations to challenge the way local services are being delivered and to offer a better, more cost effective alternative.

Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark said:

> ""The Government is united in its drive to open up public services so the best providers get the job. I am making sure that more power goes to the local level where decisions about what is needed are best made. I want local voluntary groups to have the right to deliver more services locally so that the sector are not confined to a walled-off part of councils' budgets.""

The Ministers also pledged continued investment in the training of public service commissioners and reiterated that social enterprises are eligible to apply for funding from the £1.4 billion regional growth fund.

Francis Maude, Minister for the Cabinet Office, said:

> ""In the past, huge amounts of money have gone in to public services and been swallowed up by bureaucracy before it reached the frontline. A Big Society approach will drive improvements by giving power to people working on the ground who know how to do things better.
> 
> ""I want to see a whole mix of providers. New models like public sector staff forming co-ops to run their services and civil society organisations forming new alliances with government and the private sector can drive this change. They will break down the old fashioned public service hierarchies and replace them with vibrant, efficient services that give people the support they need.""

Civil Society Minister Nick Hurd said:

> ""The commissioning Green Paper will kick-start a radical shift in public service contracting so only the most innovative approaches to win through. We know that there are too many barriers for civil society organisations that want to deliver public services and we are determined to sort them out. I'm very pleased that we can continue training public services commissioners in working with civil society, better understanding in this area will be critical to our success. It is also a great recognition of the value of social enterprises that they will be able to access the £1.4billion regional growth fund.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/communities/1836598,Have your say on new community rights to challenge and run local services,"Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark today opened a consultation on how revolutionary new rights for communities should work in practice.

The Community Right to Challenge and Community Right to Buy are two key elements of the Localism Bill, designed to hand power back to local people. They will enshrine in law the opportunity for community and voluntary groups to have a greater say over what happens in their local area.

Under the **Community Right to Buy**, local groups will have a legal right to nominate any vital community asset - including local shops, pubs, libraries and leisure centres - to be assessed for recording on a 'most wanted' list by the local council. The asset could then be listed for five years. In that time, the owner of a listed asset will have to tell the council if they intend to sell, which will trigger a window of opportunity or 'community countdown', giving people time to prepare their business plan and raise the funds they need to make a credible bid before it goes on the open market.

The **Community Right to Challenge** opens the door to a transformation in the way that local public services are run. It will give community or voluntary sector groups, as well as parish councils and council employees, new powers to challenge and take over a local service. This could include running children's centres, social care services and even improving local transport links. Under the new law, councils must respond to this challenge and consider the positive impact the proposal could have on the community. If the proposal is turned down the council must publish the reasons for this. This new right puts voluntary and charity groups on the front foot when it comes to running public services and has the potential to open up new revenue for them.

The consultations will run for 12 weeks from today, taking views from people, councils and their employees, community groups, voluntary organisations, private businesses and other interested parties.

The consultation documents can be viewed online here: [www.communities.gov.uk/consultations/](http://www.communities.gov.uk/corporate/publications/consultations/)

Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark said:

> ""It's vital that services respond to what local people really want, and give people the chance to do things their way.
> 
> ""Many voluntary and community groups have outstanding ideas about how they could deliver local services at high quality and reasonable cost, or run the local buildings and businesses that people care about in the best interests of the community.
> 
> ""We want to make it as easy as possible for them to put the new rights in the Localism Bill into practice - and we welcome thoughts on how.""

The Community Right to Buy consultation will consider a number of elements, including:

  * who should be able to nominate land or buildings for the 'most wanted list', and how
  * who should be able to trigger the 'community countdown' and whether community groups should be able to buy an asset during that period, before it goes on the open market
  * what type of land and buildings should be excluded from being put on the list.
  * how long the window of opportunity (or 'community countdown') for community groups should be

The Community Right to Challenge consultation will also consider a number of different options, including:

  * which services should not be subject to challenge
  * what information should be included in an expression of interest
  * how long a local authority has to consider an expression of interest
  * possible reasons for modifying or rejecting an expression of interest

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/communities/1848896,"£5m boost for Church to deliver stronger, more integrated communities","The Church Urban Fund has welcomed a boost of £5 million for an initiative that will bring people of different faiths together - to collaborate on projects to improve their neighbourhood and get to know each other better.

The three year programme, called Near Neighbours, will offer small grants to communities that have bright ideas for local inter faith projects. A wide range of community, education, environmental, arts, and sports activities will be eligible, as long as they encourage involvement by local people from different faiths or none.

Near Neighbours taps into the unique Church of England parish system which has presence in all neighbourhoods and an ethos as the national Church, with a responsibility towards all in the parish, as well as the Church's decades of experience in funding community projects in deprived areas.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""Religious organisations play an enormous pastoral role in our neighbourhoods and have excellent networks within our communities - none more so than the Church of England. They have been getting on with their work for centuries - offering support to youth groups, parents and pensioners and providing services to those in need.
> 
> ""Near Neighbours will build on this and bring folks from different backgrounds together for the good of the community - be it a sports event or working together to improve a local park, it will mean meeting your neighbours and getting on.
> 
> ""There are very few faith groups that don't look beyond their own faith and congregation to put something back into the community that surrounds them, so this project will build on that and I encourage people to get involved.""

The Department for Communities and Local Government has awarded the funding to the Church Urban Fund to strengthen and expand its inter faith and community development work and help break down barriers between groups of people. Near Neighbours will be set up as a charity by the Church Urban Fund and Church of England.

Church Urban Fund's chief executive Tim Bissett said:

> ""We welcome the government's recognition of the vital role churches and faith-based organisations play in local communities. More than 20 years experience has shown us local people often hold the key to solving local problems. Church Urban Fund is already working in these communities and will also use the Church's existing strong relationships and infrastructure to make this idea a reality.
> 
> ""We're also excited by the opportunities this grant presents for us to work alongside committed people from all faiths to bring about much-needed change in some of England's most diverse areas.""

Near Neighbours will start operating later in 2011 in locations in the M62 ""mill towns"" corridor, Leicester, East London and Birmingham, drawing on the resources of local churches long established in all the neighbourhoods in these areas.

The Church Urban Fund will deliver Near Neighbours in partnership with other bodies, such as the two below.

The Feast organises work in schools in the multi-religious Sparkhill and Aston areas of Birmingham, with the aim of developing better relationships between young people of Christian and Muslim faiths. Schools outreach workers build on initial encounter sessions with longer-term events that create a safe, trusting environment in which teenagers can share their faith experiences, gain a better understanding of each other's lives and develop friendships.

The Nehemiah Foundation provides training and mentoring for people and organisations seeking to develop their communities. Their 18-month full time Community Regeneration programme involves participants working with a host organisation while they learn how to assess community needs, developing business plans, carrying out an audit of previous work in the area and measuring its impact, organising local support, and building networks for effective communication. The Foundation has links with various local bodies, allowing it to tap into a wide range of areas of expertise. The Near Neighbours project will use the Foundation's expertise to train community organisers.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/communities/1896905,Government to fund housing advice service for older people,"Making decisions to move home or change utility provider can be hard work and for some older people it can simply be too much. The different processes, prices, range of suppliers, can be daunting when on your own, have not done it for years, or on a limited income, so that not making expensive mistakes is even more important.

The place to get assistance may be FirstStop.

FirstStop is a free, independent, information and advice service for older people, their families and carers, and aims to help older people make informed decisions about their housing options and support, and to help them maintain independent living in later life. The service is provided through a dedicated telephone line and website. After two years of operation FirstStop is delivering information to increasing numbers - currently 130,000 in a year - of older people and families.

As part of the Coalition Government's commitment to help protect older and vulnerable people, the Department for Communities and Local Government has today confirmed funding of £1.5m over two years in 2011-12 and 2012-13 for FirstStop.

Announcing funding for First Stop, Communities Minister Bob Neill said:

> ""As we all get older, we still want to retain our independence and our home and it is one of the Coalition Government's aims to enable people to do this.
> 
> ""But we all know that housing choices in later life are often complex and so the Government is helping by supporting the provision of information and advice from those best able to provide it. That is why today I am announcing the £1.5m funding for First Stop.""

One of the people whom First Stop has helped is Stourport resident Susan Albert.

Living in a crumbling home was the situation of 64 year-old Susan Albert in Stourport. She had no working cooking or bathing facilities and only one coal fire providing the heat. Mrs Albert had lived there for 30 years, but was now sleeping on the sofa downstairs and eating all her meals at the local cafe, or relying on cuppa-soups. Widowed a year earlier, and not in good health, she was now on her own as her two children had long ago moved away from the area and were not able to help her.

![Susan Albert](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1896944)

Fortunately a friend thinking that a home improvement loan might help approached the local Care and Repair Agency, who put her in touch with First Stop.

FirstStop Advice worker Elisa Steery* set up a meeting with Susan Albert at the local cafe, and they talked about what Susan would really like to do about her home and started to explore her options. Mrs Albert explained that she would prefer to downsize to live in a more manageable modernised property. Coping with the building works that her home clearly needed would be hard for her to do.

Elisa helped her to organise a survey on her home, which revealed that it failed on all four counts of the Decent Homes Standard. As a result Mrs Albert joined the local choice-based lettings scheme in a priority band.

Working with the local housing association, Elisa helped Mrs Albert bid for ground floor flats in the area as they became available. Elisa also turned ""Sherlock Holmes"" to find the deeds to the family home, and then helped get it to auction via a local estate agent. Once Mrs Albert's old property has been sold at auction, Elisa will organise for a FirstStop financial adviser to visit to discuss the best options for investing her capital.

Mrs Albert has now moved to a ground floor apartment with a level access shower, in a good location with easy access to shops and a GP surgery. Elisa has ensured that Susan Albert is getting all the social support benefits to which she is entitled and helped her to organise changes of address and swap accounts for gas and electric.

![Susan Albert](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1897508)

Using the Government funds FirstStop will develop sustainable revenue streams and achieve independence from public funding. It will continue to develop partnerships with local authorities, charities and home improvement agencies, to offer an integrated casework service 'support to move' (often called downsizing) service to more vulnerable clients, and to provide a phone support service for clients who can be helped without this more intensive face-to-face support. It will also continue to train housing and other professionals to offer integrated housing, care and finance advice to older people, their families and carers; and to develop peer-to-peer advice skills among older volunteers through, for examples, partnerships with local older people's forums.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/communities/1949789,Andrew Stunell applauds community with designs on housing,"Communities Minister Andrew Stunell celebrated with residents of Crosby Ravensworth in Eden Valley, Cumbria, as the first bricks were laid for the village's new community led housing scheme.

![Andrew Stunell laying bricks in Crosby Ravensworth in Eden Valley, Cumbria, for the village's new community led housing scheme.](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1950080)

With the help of the Department for Communities and Local Government, the Homes and Communities Agency and Eden District Council, local residents set up their own housing association, The Lyvennet Community Trust, in order to overcome the bureaucratic barriers holding up progress on the building of essential affordable housing.

With an investment of £660,000 by the Homes and Communities Agency and a further £1 million of funding from a Charity Bank, The Trust has created a scheme made up of 12 homes, with 10 for rent and two for shared ownership. An additional eight properties for self builders are also planned, in response to interest from local people to have a hand in the design and construction of their own homes.

Speaking on the anniversary of the Prime Minister's launch of the Big Society vanguards, Andrew Stunell said:

> ""What the residents of Crosby Ravensworth have achieved is remarkable. From canvassing the need for affordable housing to laying the first brick today they have demonstrated how community led solutions can bring lasting change to local needs. I am sure communities up and down the country will draw inspiration and ideas from the Eden Valley vanguard to shape their local services.""

David Graham Chairman of the The Lyvennet Community Trust said:

> ""We have been working on the housing project for some two and a half years and today sees another milestone with the start of build. Involvement with the Big Society vanguard has helped speed up progress and we are grateful for the support given by our community, construction team, council and national government agencies.""

The community led solutions are bringing widespread benefits to the area and Mr Stunell also visited the Butchers Arms pub, purchased by the community for £250,000 raised through a shares initiative. The community pub is to re-open shortly as a traditional Cumbrian pub selling local ales and providing a venue for local sports, events and celebrations.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/communities/1959298,Bob Neill says 'three cheers' for the 'local' at the Great British Beer Festival,"![Pint of beer at the Great British Beer Festival](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1959524.jpg)Community Pubs minister Bob Neill attended the country's biggest beer festival at Earl's Court yesterday where he outlined plans that could help ensure cherished locals stay open following a sale.

Speaking at the Great British Beer Festival, Mr Neill formally launched a public consultation on a legal clause, called a restrictive covenant, which can lead to the closure of pubs - potentially depriving thousands of regulars of their much loved local and also preventing them from being able to run their pub as a community asset.

The Minister was given a tour of Britain's biggest beer festival by Campaign for Real Ale National Chairman Colin Valentine and invited to sample one of the featured ales.

### Celebrating tradition

The Great British Beer festival attracts thousands of thirsty punters each year to celebrate the great British pub and sample the huge selection of beers, ciders and ales that are brewed across the country. The Great British Beer Festival celebrates all that's traditional about the 'local' including pub grub, live music and traditional pub games like shove ha'penny, bar billiards, skittles and darts. At yesterday's event the Mighty Oak brewery's beer 'Oscar Wilde' was crowned 'best beer' in Britain.

### Hubs of community life

Speaking to an audience from the beer and pub industry, Mr Neill emphasised the importance of the pub as a hub of community life, as important to the local social scene as to the local economy.  
   
He said:

> ""Pubs are hubs of community life, as important to the local social scene as they are to the local economy. Throughout their rich and diverse history they have proved themselves to be resilient, enterprising and full of initiative. But time is being called at too many of our 'locals', depriving people of treasured places to get together in the community.  
> 
> ""We are putting the people back in charge, giving them the power to step in and save their much loved community assets. Communities across the country are already stepping in to save their pub from closure. By reviewing this restrictive red tape we are giving people another opportunity to use their collective powers to ensure that their locals remain local and continue to thrive at the heart of the community.""

Mike Benner, Chief Executive of Campaign for Real Ale said:

> ""Campaign for Real Ale wholeheartedly welcomes this announcement of a government consultation on the use of restrictive covenants - it's a great success for localism, and shows that government recognises that pubs are vital community assets that need to be protected. For the new community right to buy scheme being introduced as part of the Localism Bill to work, pubs need to be available for communities to keep open.
>

### Keeping spirits high

![Baroness Newlove with Eileen and Seamus McCallion at the ](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1994326)Among the 10 award winners of City West Housing's Make a Difference Awards were Eileen and Seamus McCallion who run the Tiger Moth Public House, in recognition of the kindness they showed in the aftermath of the Irlam gas explosion. By providing food, drink and a meeting place for those affected Eileen and Seamus played a crucial role in keeping community spirits high, even hosting a joint birthday party for two of the youngest people to be affected and numerous fundraising events.

Brookhouse Community Association won the Greatest Group award. The group has provided bingo for the elderly, youth activities, parties to mark the Royal wedding and the Brookhouse Festival that saw 200 people attend last year. It also acts as an advisory group that brings together the NHS, police and Salford City Council to deliver improvements to the local community.

The Young Rising Star title was won by 11 year old Molly Moores, recognised for her volunteering work and as a shining example to other young people.

Baroness Newlove said:

> ""It was a great privilege to hear from and help recognise the fantastic efforts of so many inspirational West Salford residents.
> 
> ""Having decided to rollup their sleeves and get stuck into community activities from establishing thriving community allotments, supporting their elderly neighbours to the great kindness offered to those affected by the Irlam Gas explosion, they serve as an inspiration to us all to get involved in making our neighbourhoods safer and more enjoyable places to live. It's unsung heroes like these that hold the key to creating peaceful, happy, clean and wonderful neighbourhoods and I'm delighted the true community spirit which has served this nation so well over the years lives and thrives in Salford.""

Launched in October 2008, City West Housing Trust is a not for profit Housing Association which owns and manages around 14,600 homes in West Salford. Now in their second year, City West Housing's Make a Difference Awards recognises all those who have made a positive impact in the community by improving people's lives, opportunities and neighbourhoods.

The memorial garden has been revived and redesigned with the help and ideas from young people, who took part in Whitefriars Housing's summer 'Boot Camp' project.![Baroness Newlove at Wellington Gardens](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2021762)

### Helping young people improve their life chances

The Boot Camp course - the first of its kind to be run by a housing association - involved youngsters, some of whom, had been involved in low level anti-social behaviour taking part in a week of activities with the housing association. The course included physical challenges, CV writing, interview skills, and fundraising and community projects aimed at helping young people improve their life chances, with the most-improved going on to secure an apprenticeship with the housing organisation.

Baroness Newlove said:

> ""Young people have a really important role to play in helping to create stronger happier and safer communities. Instead of looking at them as part of the problem, it's far better to include them as part of the solution. They need only to be channelled in the right direction to release all their positive energy. Their bright ideas, creativity and enthusiasm can make a real and positive difference to their local neighbourhood.
> 
> ""It's so heart warming to see projects such as those run by Whitefriars housing. Their belief in the potential of young people to turn their lives around and make a positive contribution to the local area has not only led to the creation of this wonderful memorial garden that can be enjoyed by the whole community but it has also given these young people new skills that will help them on their way to a brighter future.""

Seventeen-year-old Katy O'Beirne, from Cheylesmore, was named the winner of Boot Camp and is now a housing apprentice with Whitefriars. Speaking at the Rose Community Centre, where local residents were shown a film of the success of Boot Camp, she said:

> ""Boot Camp gave me an opportunity to turn my life around and I really enjoyed the things we did.
> 
> ""I love being an apprentice and I want to work hard because I really value the opportunity I have been given.""

The memorial garden includes a sculpture from renowned Coventry-born sculptor Walter Ritchie, who died in 1997. Walter's partner Sally Taylor attended the official opening.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/corporate/1588186,Cameron and Clegg launch the Big Society,"Prime Minister David Cameron and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg announced their plans for a new era of people power at the centre of the new Government today. Their plans will empower communities, roll back big government, bureaucracy and Whitehall power. The Prime Minister promised that the idea of the Big Society would be marching through the corridors of power, starting a deep and serious reform agenda to take power away from politicians and give it to people.

Speaking on the Daily Politics Show CLG Minister of State Greg Clark said:

> ""There is a very exciting new approach here. For too long now, government has been something done to people. There is the chance of re-thinking politics to get people in the heart of government, to help them to do things in their own community. I think it's important that government is run by people rather than imposed on people.""

### A Greater Say for Communities

The policies announced today include;

  * Giving communities a greater say over their local planning system and saving local services, such as post offices and pubs.

  * Piloting a new National Citizen Service which will give 16 year olds the chance to develop the skills needed to be active and responsible citizens, mix with people from different backgrounds, and start getting involved in their communities.

  * Extending powers for local government by giving a general power of competence to local councils, enabling them to act as they see fit in the best interests of their communities, as well as conducting a comprehensive review of local government finance in order to help remove restrictions that limit the work of local councils.

  * Supporting mutuals, co-operatives, charities and social enterprises, giving them greater involvement in the running of public services. Funds from dormant bank accounts will be used to establish a Big Society Bank, providing new funds for neighbourhood groups, charities, social enterprises and other non-governmental bodies.

Please see the Cabinet Office Press Notice and the agreed policies for building the Big Society for more information (see top right).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/corporate/1612979,New study shows support for new homes,"The British public are far more supportive of new housing developments in their area than commonly thought, according to a new study published today.

Today's _Public Attitudes to Housing_ survey, published by the National Housing and Planning Advisory Unit (NHPAU), finds that more than three quarters of people would support more homes being built in their area, provided that local services such as GP surgeries and schools do not suffer.

Good quality housing design is also important to people with 73 per cent saying they would support the building of more homes if well designed and in keeping with their local area.

Speaking to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) earlier this week, Housing Minister Grant Shapps outlined his plans to introduce incentives for local communities to give the green light to new developments, while at the same time ensuring local services are able to meet the community's needs.

He said:

> ""If we are really serious about supporting people's aspirations for home ownership, the real prize is we must build more homes. For the first time incentives will create direct benefits for local communities, bringing jobs, investment and more homes for local people.
> 
> ""Rather than being told what to build and where, residents of villages, towns and cities will be able to develop their own vision for their place.""

Today's NHPAU survey also shows that while the vast majority of people aspire to own their own homes, their efforts are still being hampered by the economic downturn. While 82 per cent see home ownership as preferable to renting and other forms of tenure, three quarters of 25-34 year olds who do not own a home and expect to rent for the next three years, want to buy but cannot afford to do so.

In his speech to RICS, Mr Shapps heralded the return of an Age of Aspiration for new homeowners, and committed the Coalition Government's support for those struggling to get their first foothold on the housing ladder.

He said:

> ""I believe that it is human nature to aspire to shelter and security - and for the many that means owning the roof over your own head.
> 
> ""And I don't consider it my job as Housing Minister to hold those aspirations back.
> 
> ""With a new Government and despite the enormous financial difficulties the country faces, I want to state clearly today:
> 
> ""The Age of Aspiration is back.""

One of the new councillors he met at the event at City Hall on Thursday 1 July was James Bond, an independent councillor for Harrow.

The reception was organised by the London Assembly and London Councils to welcome members to their role, show how the organisations can work together and enable the councillors to meet others from across London.

Addressing the new councillors Eric Pickles, said:

> ""Whatever your politics this is the most exciting time to be in local government. For too long central government treated local government like a lapdog: feeding it scraps with one hand, while keeping it on a tight leash with the other. That's not how our relationship is going to work. I have too much respect for local government for that. I trust you - the councillors - to make right decisions for your community. We can build a Big Society and make localism a reality.
> 
> ""I want to see double devolution, not just transferring power from central government to local authorities, but for power to transfer down to individuals and communities.
> 
> ""I say to you as new councillors - don't hang around waiting for instructions from central government. The opportunities for you to exercise real power, make real decisions, make a real difference in your community are there for the taking.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/corporate/1650035,Business backs local enterprise partnerships,"This week the Communities and Local Government Secretary, Eric Pickles met with the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) and the Federation of Small Business (FSB) to discuss the importance of business leadership and vision for local enterprise partnerships, which are intended to drive local economic growth across England.

The Communities and Local Government Secretary, Eric Pickles said:

> ""We want to urgently rebuild and rebalance local economies without strangling businesses with red tape so that new economic opportunities spread across the country.
> 
> ""I was delighted to meet with and hear the views of the Federation for Small Business and British Chamber of Commerce - they have a central role to play, working hand in hand with local leaders, to develop and deliver new local enterprise partnerships that will make the economy responsive to the needs of local business and local people.""

Small businesses and local chambers of commerce as key business partners will have a key role helping to develop and deliver local enterprise partnerships with local councils.

David Frost, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said:

> ""The future of our local economies - from Cornwall to Carlisle - hinges on the growth of the wealth-generating private sector. The Secretary of State and I are in complete agreement on this point.
> 
> ""We also agree that Chambers of Commerce, the beating hearts of England's local business communities, must play a crucial leadership role in delivering that growth. As local enterprise partnerships develop across the country, Chambers will work together with local councils to set a clear vision for growth, prosperity, and jobs - and will help deliver the innovative, private-sector leadership that local enterprise partnerships will need to succeed.""

Mike Cherry, Policy Chairman, Federation of Small Businesses, said:

> ""Small businesses must not be ignored and it is crucial that their voice is heard in the newly established local enterprise partnerships, so it is fantastic news that the FSB is going to be the key business partner. While we welcome the creation of these new bodies, we all know that the 4.8 million small firms are the engine room of the economy and the key to creating jobs and so must play a vital role in these new groupings.
> 
> ""It is crucial, during this time of economic uncertainty, that the influence of the small business community continues to be felt at local and regional level. We are working closely with the Coalition Government on putting local enterprise partnerships in place and we want to ensure that the new entities will deliver results so that small firms have the ability to grow and develop, and ultimately boost local economies.""

The Government is committed to replacing the Regional Development Agencies with local enterprise partnerships of elected authorities and businesses who can provide the strategic leadership and economic vision for their local area. To be effective, it is crucial that business works in equal partnership with civic leaders to drive real change in public service delivery and create a better business environment.

### Lord Heseltine to lead Regional Growth Fund Panel

The Government also announced today that Lord Heseltine will chair the Independent Approval Panel for the £1bn Regional Growth Fund. The new Panel will consider proposals for funding and recommend to Ministers which projects should be taken forward.

Communities Secretary, Eric Pickles said:

> ""Lord Heseltine is the perfect choice for Chair: his regeneration pedigree will be vital when identifying the projects that deserve Regional Growth Fund support.
> 
> ""Local enterprise partnerships will be central to that by returning democratic accountability they will show how local businesses, local councils and communities - freed from bureaucratic hurdles - can work together to reopen and rebalance Britain's economy.""

The Regional Growth Fund has been set up to provide support for projects that offer significant potential for sustainable economic growth and can create new private sector employment. It will particularly help areas and communities currently highly-reliant on public sector employment make the transition to growth and prosperity. In a consultation published today, the Government is seeking views on how the fund should be designed to best meet the needs of areas and communities across England. Launching the consultation, the Deputy Prime Minister said:

> ""The Regional Growth Fund is an innovative new mechanism to unleash the talent and drive that will help get the country back on its feet.""

Local enterprise partnerships will play an important role in bringing together bids for the Regional Growth Fund, working with key partners such as universities. Private sector companies and other public-private partnerships will also be invited to bid independently for the fund.

Lord Heseltine said:

> ""I am delighted to have been asked to help with this exciting project. It builds on the experiences I've had in helping people in deprived areas to help themselves and their communities achieve aspirations that, without schemes of this sort, might be impossible.
> 
> ""This is about local people, local initiatives and local success in areas where the inevitable cuts will be most heavily felt.""

Business Secretary, Vince Cable added:

> ""I'm delighted that Lord Heseltine and Sir Ian Wrigglesworth have agreed to lead the Approval Panel for this important initiative.
> 
> ""The Regional Growth Fund demonstrates that England is open for business. It will support enterprise and incentivise the growth of local economies; mobilizing private sector investment across the country and creating sustainable private sector jobs. And Michael and Ian's experience and strategic oversight will help ensure it is a success.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/corporate/1735538,Grant Shapps to abolish century-old payment rules for parish councils,"Local Government Minister, Grant Shapps, has today unveiled plans to free England's 9,000 parish councils from archaic rules which prevent them from using modern banking methods and making fast and easy payments to the small businesses they employ.

Parish councils spend over £340million each year. But under laws introduced in 1894, even the smallest payments must be signed off by at two members of the council - creating a time-consuming process and leading them to use cheques instead of quick electronic transfers. In contrast, the Payments Council reports that cheque usage fell by £21.5billion in the last year alone.

So the Minister has confirmed that from 2011, parish councils will be given the freedom to use modern banking methods - in time for the abolition of cheques in eight years' time.  These changes are set to benefit the many private companies that parish councils employ, as they should now be paid faster.

The National Association of Local Councils and the Society of Local Council Clerks will now work together to put important safeguards in place so all payments made by parish councils are legitimate and there is no misuse of the system.

Local Government Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Parish Councils have been around for over a hundred years, but it doesn't mean they should be bound by outdated rules which make it harder for them to serve their local community.
> 
> ""It's time to bring Parish Councils into the 21st Century so they can get on and do their jobs in a faster and simpler way.
> 
> ""This is about removing the barriers so that local people can deliver the services that their communities care about, but it could also help hard pressed contractors who rely on quick payments to survive.""

The move has also been supported by the National Association of Local Councils, whose Chairman Councillor Michael Chater said:

> ""I am delighted that the Government is making it easier for local councils to get on and do their job through modernising the rules on the way they can make payments.
> 
> ""This much needed reform is very welcome and underlines the important role local councils play in their communities supporting local people and local businesses.
> 
> ""This initiative will give a much welcome boost to local councils to help them operate more efficiently and effectively and enable them to continue to play their role at the heart of localism and Big Society.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/corporate/1746796,Baroness Hanham calls on councils to be innovative in order to make savings,"Councils need to be innovative in how they manage their assets and services, said Local Government Minister Baroness Hanham.

Speaking about the implications of the Spending Review at the Local Government Group Conference, Baroness Hanham said:

> ""The productivity challenge facing councils is how to manage the impact of reduced funding by identifying those areas where savings could be made while protecting vital frontline services.""

Local authorities own over £128 billion worth of buildings and land across the country. Baroness Hanham said they needed to consider innovation when thinking about how they manage their assets and co-locate services.   
   
Some councils have already started to put this into action by creating a one stop shop for local services, putting health services, job centres, and police into one area or building. Kent County Council estimate that countywide approaches to jointly managing LA assets and other public sector assets could deliver around £40 million per annum potential revenue savings. 

Local Government Minister Baroness Hanham said:

> ""Councils must take the lead at the local level. They have the freedoms and flexibility to deliver their services in a streamlined and efficient way. By working with local authorities and public bodies, they can maintain vital front line services whilst making savings.  
   
""By working with other local authorities and public bodies, co-location of services means that local residents have just one point of call for advice and help. My department is working with local areas by setting up the 'Capital and Asset Pathfinders' that will help encourage more authorities to better manage their capital and assets by removing national barriers and unlock potential savings through cross agency collaboration.""

Other ways Councils are finding savings:

  * smarter procurement, increased collaboration and economies of scale, for example 16 London boroughs have saved more than £10 million buying ICT hardware collaboratively through an e-Auction

  * streamlining and merging operations, for example Kensington and Chelsea, Hammersmith and Fulham, and Westminster councils plan to merge back office services, and are exploring options to move to a single senior management team and chief executive.

The Local Government Group set up Place Based Productivity Programme to help councils challenge barriers that stand in the way of improvement and find new ways of working in response to the Spending Review (see link right).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/corporate/1775866,Radical reforms for social housing,"Plans for the most radical reform of social housing in a generation have been announced by Housing Minister Grant Shapps and Communities Minister Andrew Stunell.

### Power shift

The changes will bring a fundamental shift of power from Whitehall to councils and local housing associations.

> ""The new system will protect the most vulnerable in society, ensuring those in greatest housing need are given priority.""

Mr Shapps said the current centrally-determined rules to allocate social homes are unfair and, despite £17bn of investment in new social housing over the last 13 years, have caused the number of people on waiting lists to nearly double to five million people, whilst a quarter of a million social homes remain overcrowded, and 400,000 under-occupied.

Councils will now be given more flexibility to use their social housing stock to the maximum effect and drive down waiting lists, which currently stand at five million people. Housing Associations will also be given the option to offer new affordable rents and use this revenue to build more affordable homes.

### Fairness and flexibility

Proposals have been published to make the system fairer. Councils will have greater local discretion to decide allocations and the option to offer flexible tenancies.

Councils will also have more flexibility to help homeless families and existing tenants who may be trapped in unsuitable accommodation, or who are unable to take up a job offer because they can't move.

The rules will strike a sensible balance between the needs of new and existing tenants, and ensure the support that social housing provides is focussed on the most vulnerable and those who need it most, for as long as they need it.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""For far too long in this country there has been a lazy consensus about the use of social housing, which has left one of our most valuable resources trapped in a system that helps far fewer people than it should.
> 
> ""The new system will protect the most vulnerable in society, ensuring those in greatest housing need are given priority. It will also be more flexible, with councils and housing associations able to offer fixed tenancies that give people the helping hand they need, when they need it. But above all it will be fairer - councils will now be able to make decisions that genuinely meet the needs of local people, and the changes will not affect any existing tenants.""

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""To have five million people stuck on social housing waiting lists is unacceptable - clearly this system is broken and needs a radical overhaul.
> 
> ""We need to have a much smarter system that protects lifetime tenancies, but also provides the flexibility to ensure that help is targeted at people who really need it, and enables us to get more for every pound of taxpayers' money. In times of economic hardship, it is vital that social housing is effective in helping people get back on their feet.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/corporate/1867778,Community refuse to call time on their local,"The Government's Localism Bill, which aims to take power from the centre and give it directly to communities, will enable people to have a much greater say on what happens in their area.

One aspect of the bill that will do this is the 'Community Right to Buy', which will make it easier for people to take over cherished local assets such as their village shop or their community centre, and save them from closure. It will do this by making sure community organisations have a fair chance to bid to take over assets and facilities that are important to them.

One community that is already showing others how to take care of their local assets is Hudswell village in North Yorkshire.

When their local pub 'The George and Dragon' closed three years ago and looked likely to remain empty, local residents got together to take action. Forming a cooperative, members sought local investment, and about 100 members of the community put up funds that enabled them to buy the pub.

After a period of refurbishment carried out by volunteers the pub was reopened, becoming a real centre of the community, offering the local populace more than just a range of ales.

### More than a pub

Martin Booth, Co-director of Hudswell Community Pub Ltd and one of the founder members of the cooperative explains it took a lot of work but the pub is doing 'alright', confounding the critics who said it would not work.

![embed: ](http://www.youtube.com/v/rVYk7KCiFjw?fs=1&hl=en_GB)

_A transcript of this video is available below._

The George and Dragon's garden is now the site for community allotments, the pub includes space for a small shop, a library as well as offering internet access and laptops available to rent out.

Talking about how the village has been affected by the Cooperative's efforts Martin Booth said;

> ""The village has really come together, the amount of community spirit that has been generated by the project is quite incredible.
> 
> ""It's more than a pub, it's a centre for village life, which is always what we wanted it to be.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/corporate/1872389,Grant Shapps: Budget is a boost for first time buyers,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has hailed a new scheme that will help 10,000 aspiring first time buyers get foot on the property ladder.

It was announced in The Budget that the Government is to make £250 million available for a new FirstBuy scheme to help first time buyers who are struggling to purchase a new home, due to requirements for a large deposit.

Over the next two years FirstBuy will help 10,000 prospective first time buyers purchase new build homes, providing a shot in the arm for the construction industry.

Housebuilders will match the Government's contribution to the scheme, which will provide a 20 per cent equity loan to top up first time buyers own deposit of 5 per cent, enabling buyers to take out a mortgage for 75 per cent of the property.

First time buyers are vital for the housing market and for the sales of new build homes and Mr Shapps said that giving them a foot up onto the housing ladder goes to the heart of the Government's commitment to support aspiration.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Demand for new homes is still growing, but last year housebuilding slumped to its lowest peacetime level since 1924.

> ""First time buyers are still facing huge difficulties - many young people are being forced to postpone homeownership until their thirties and creditworthy first time buyers on good incomes are missing out on the opportunity to enter housing market by the lack of a large cash deposit.
> 
> ""By making up to £250 million available over the next two years for deposits on new build homes, this Budget shows that we are serious about sorting this out, and supporting our construction industry to build more homes, create new jobs and increase the pace of economic growth.""

Loans will be free of charge for the first five years and repaid on resale of the property, with the funds recycled to fund more homes for the scheme. The first homes are expected to come on stream in September 2011.

Industry bodies welcomed the announcement as a much needed boost for the housing market.

Sarah Webb, Chartered Institute of Housing Chief Executive, said:

> ""Our housing market is still in intensive care but this measure to give first time buyers access to a sizeable deposit as an interest free loan is a welcome adrenaline boost. We are currently building fewer than half of the homes we need and anything the government can do to support new house building and support construction sector jobs is welcome.""

Stewart Baseley, Housebuilders Federation, said:

> ""We are pleased the government is listening to industry concerns and has recognised the economic and social benefits of building more homes. With Firstbuy the Government has stepped up with a policy that will help first time buyers, boost economic growth and provide a vital shot in the arm for the housebuilding industry.""

David Orr, National Housing Federation, said:

> ""First-time buyers have effectively been locked out of the housing market since the credit crunch by the mortgage drought. Only those lucky few who have been able to put down huge deposits up front have had any chance of getting a foot on the property ladder up until now. This scheme will offer first-time buyers on moderate incomes a much needed helping hand towards buying an affordable home and is a very welcome move.""

Pete Redfern, Taylor Wimpey, said:

> ""We are pleased to see George Osborne's announcement on FirstBuy in the budget. Whilst we control our use of shared equity schemes carefully, we do believe that they have a place given the current challenges in the mortgage market. This new government scheme will allow us to maximise our support to first time buyers whilst focusing more of our capital on investment in new sites.""

Other radical announcements in the budget designed to get the country building again include:

  * powerful new incentives through the New Homes Bonus to give communities a share in the rewards of growth, and a reason to say yes to new development

  * removing the unfavourable Stamp Duty treatment of bulk purchases of new build homes

  * radical plans to accelerate the release of public sector land for development - making use of innovative 'build now, pay later' techniques, where house builders don't pay for the land until they complete the houses

  * introduction of a Community Infrastructure Levy, which local councils can raise to fund local facilities that support housing growth

  * reforming the planning system through a range of measures, including the introduction of a powerful new presumption in favour of sustainable development, removing centrally imposed, top down targets, and consult on plans to simplify the planning process.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/corporate/1930689,Bob Neill hails the Great British seaside at international coastal conference,"Communities Minister Bob Neill spoke about the enormous economic potential of the Great British seaside in a speech at the first ever international conference for coastal communities.

Held in the seaside setting of Clacton, the conference discussed how seaside towns can become economic hubs and shared success stories from as far a field as France, Italy, and Malta.

The event was hosted by Tendring District Council, Essex County Council and the Council of Europe.

Communities Minister Bob Neill said:

> ""Event's like this are an important way to highlight to unique role coastal areas and seaside towns play in Britain's history, culture and economy.
> 
> ""Come rain or shine we all have fond memories of trips to the Great British Seaside, but they are more than holiday destinations we also need to ensure they are great places to live and work. Many seaside towns are showing how they can become year round places of business given the opportunity.
> 
> ""The Government is committed to rebalancing local economies through local enterprise partnerships and small business tax breaks as well as by putting local people back in charge of their own economic growth through neighbourhood plans and community incentives like the New Homes Bonus.""

Neil Stock, Leader of Tendring District Council, said:

> ""Businesses are willing to invest if they get the right messages from the public sector. It is up us to create the right environment for them to operate and draw in the money which will lead to more jobs and regeneration in Tendring.""

### Communities back in control

Putting local authorities and communities back in charge and giving them the freedom to drive their own economic development and growth is a key priority for the Government:

  * Through the Localism Bill, the Government is devolving greater powers to councils and neighbourhoods, so local communities are able to shape their own future.

  * The Government has invited local business and local councils to come together and take charge of their local economy and establish local enterprise partnerships. The new network of 35 Local Enterprise partnerships covers 95 per cent of all businesses and 96 per cent of the population in England.

  * Kent, Greater Essex and East Sussex local enterprise partnerships, who attended the conference, are already working together and have set up a new group to look at some of the issues facing the coastal towns in their area.

  * To further encourage investment across the country the Government is creating 21 new Enterprise Zones to be developed within the local enterprise partnerships. Businesses in Enterprise Zones will benefit from superfast broadband, lower business tax rates, low levels of regulation and planning controls, and reduced business rates.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/corporate/1946851,Southend Airport expansion brings new connections to Thames Gateway,"Thames Gateway Minister Bob Neill saw how Southend Airport is playing a crucial role in expanding the connectivity of the Thames Gateway as he officially opened the airport's new, state-of-the-art control tower.

The new tower is part of Southend Airport's huge expansion process, which will see it receiving another 800,000 passengers through new partners Easyjet next year, aiming for two million passengers per year in the long run.

Mr Neill was shown around the control tower, which commands an impressive view of the Thames Gateway, by members of the air traffic control team and heard how the airport was creating around 500 new jobs and training opportunities.

On his departure, Mr Neill emphasised the importance Southend Airport would play as a transport hub for the Thames Gateway, marking the first day of National Express' train service to the new dedicated airport train station by catching one of the 50 minute services direct to London Liverpool Street.

Bob Neill said:

> ""Today Southend Airport has taken another important step in its expansion with the official opening of its new, state-of-the-art control tower, which is the newest in the UK. I've seen for myself the excellent work the airport is doing to employ and train local talent and their plans over the next year will see 500 more jobs created. It's great to see how committed Stobart and Easyjet are to fulfilling the potential of Southend and the Thames Gateway.
> 
> ""It's wonderful that I've been able to leave the airport by train. With its dedicated station running services into London via Stratford for the first time today it's clear that Southend airport will be an absolutely essential transport hub for the Olympic Games. And its potential goes way beyond London 2012: this growing airport will create many thousands of new jobs across Essex over the coming years, improve the Thames Gateway's international connectivity and deliver economic growth for local people and businesses.""

Other new developments underway at London Southend include a new terminal building, runway extension and a new airport hotel.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/corporate/1959340,Bob Neill says 'three cheers' for the 'local' at the Great British Beer Festival,"![Pint of beer at the Great British Beer Festival](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1959524.jpg)Community Pubs minister Bob Neill attended the country's biggest beer festival at Earl's Court yesterday where he outlined plans that could help ensure cherished locals stay open following a sale.

Speaking at the Great British Beer Festival, Mr Neill formally launched a public consultation on a legal clause, called a restrictive covenant, which can lead to the closure of pubs - potentially depriving thousands of regulars of their much loved local and also preventing them from being able to run their pub as a community asset.

The Minister was given a tour of Britain's biggest beer festival by Campaign for Real Ale National Chairman Colin Valentine and invited to sample one of the featured ales.

### Celebrating tradition

The Great British Beer festival attracts thousands of thirsty punters each year to celebrate the great British pub and sample the huge selection of beers, ciders and ales that are brewed across the country. The Great British Beer Festival celebrates all that's traditional about the 'local' including pub grub, live music and traditional pub games like shove ha'penny, bar billiards, skittles and darts. At yesterday's event the Mighty Oak brewery's beer 'Oscar Wilde' was crowned 'best beer' in Britain.

### Hubs of community life

Speaking to an audience from the beer and pub industry, Mr Neill emphasised the importance of the pub as a hub of community life, as important to the local social scene as to the local economy.  
   
He said:

> ""Pubs are hubs of community life, as important to the local social scene as they are to the local economy. Throughout their rich and diverse history they have proved themselves to be resilient, enterprising and full of initiative. But time is being called at too many of our 'locals', depriving people of treasured places to get together in the community.  
> 
> ""We are putting the people back in charge, giving them the power to step in and save their much loved community assets. Communities across the country are already stepping in to save their pub from closure. By reviewing this restrictive red tape we are giving people another opportunity to use their collective powers to ensure that their locals remain local and continue to thrive at the heart of the community.""

Mike Benner, Chief Executive of Campaign for Real Ale said:

> ""Campaign for Real Ale wholeheartedly welcomes this announcement of a government consultation on the use of restrictive covenants - it's a great success for localism, and shows that government recognises that pubs are vital community assets that need to be protected. For the new community right to buy scheme being introduced as part of the Localism Bill to work, pubs need to be available for communities to keep open.
> 
> ""It's a victory too for people power: this proposal came from communities on the ground, via their local councils who put the proposals to central government.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/corporate/1983349,The riots one month on: the good work must continue,"This week marks one month since the worst of the rioting hit the streets of some of our biggest cities. Since then, councils have been pulling out all the stops to get affected areas back to normal, local businesses back up and running, and those forced to move out of their homes back into safe and stable accommodation.

Within days of the riots taking place, the Government launched a multi million pound package of support to overcome the immediate recovery issues that communities and businesses were facing and to help them get back on their feet. The latest figures show that 30 local authorities are making use of the funds to support the small traders, businesses and families in their area that were directly affected by the riots.

The money has been used for a wide range of support measures - from helping small businesses with upfront costs like insurance excesses, building repairs, and carrying out safety checks, to reducing business rates and encouraging customers back into affected areas. It has also been used to meet the immediate costs of emergency accommodation for families who have been made homeless and offer council tax discounts or relief to those whose homes have been damaged but are still habitable.

Local authorities played a key role in the immediate recovery operation and continue to lead the way by administering the support schemes, which are delivering tangible results and making a real difference to communities:

  * [Croydon Council](http://www.croydon.gov.uk/advice/emergencies/civil-unrest/latest-information) (external link) has opened a temporary 'one stop shop' to provide people affected by the civil unrest with immediate advice and support on everything from insurance claims to housing and emergency benefits. A £100,000 'Family Support Fund' has also been made available to families directly affected to cover short-term costs and bring about a sense of normality - for example using the money to buy school uniforms for the new school year, or to meet higher rental costs of temporary accommodation.
  * [Manchester City Council](http://www.manchester.gov.uk/news/article/6047/council_announces_support_package_for_riot-hit_businesses) (external link) has reduced business rates to businesses in the city and made grants of up to £2,500 and loans available to those who took a direct hit from the riots. The city also launched the [I Love MCR campaign](http://www.manchester.gov.uk/info/100009/events_leisure_and_tourism/5228/i_love_mcr) (external link) to demonstrate pride in the city and encourage people back to shop, eat, drink and socialise in the city.
  * [Ealing Council](http://www.ealing.gov.uk/homepage/64/riot_recovery) (external link) has a £250,000 fund to help independent traders that suffered damage from vandals and looters, helping them pay for things like new glazing and building repairs. The council has also offered interest free repayable grants to the worst affected small traders, which are likely to have to remain closed for up to six months.
  * [Lambeth Council](http://www.lambeth.gov.uk/News/2011/220811LambethBusinessCommunitiesWorkingTogether.htm) (external link) has been holding 'drop in' surgeries for businesses to learn more about the recovery support available, how to apply for funds to tide them over while they get back on their feet again, and get help filling out compensation forms.

The support packages were part of concerted, cross-Government action to help rebuild communities, open up shops and buildings which were damaged, make sure people who lost their homes were re-housed, and to help councils get their areas back to normal as quickly as possible. The measures announced included:

  * a £10million Recovery Scheme which was put in place to help councils with the immediate costs of making their areas safe, clear and clean again, and to enable them to provide council tax discounts to affected residents.
  * a £20million High Street Support Scheme to support Small and Medium sized business affected by the disturbances by providing business rate hardship relief, rebuilding confidence and helping affected businesses get back up and running.
  * a £1million Homelessness Support Scheme which met the immediate costs of re-housing those made homeless by the disturbances with a maximum payment threshold of up to £5,000 per household, with discretion applied for exceptional costs.
  * a £20million London Enterprise Fund to kick-start economic growth and regeneration mainly in Tottenham and Croydon, to be administered by the Mayor of London alongside his £50million recovery fund.

The measures came on top of support for individual homeowners and businesses under the Riot (Damages) Act and local authorities under the Bellwin Scheme, and a £3million 'High Street Fund' set up with contributions from the Mayor, leading UK companies and local authorities to offer initial recovery grants to small businesses.

This week, the Secretary of State is meeting with the leaders of those local authorities affected by the riots to discuss how to restore commercial and community confidence in affected areas, and any difficulties they are facing in recovering from the disturbances or any barriers that need addressing.

And whilst areas are given time to recover and return to normality, they have pledged to continue to work closely with councils and provide support at a national level to ensure that every business forced to close, and every family forced to move, are helped back into their community as quickly as possible.

The memorial garden has been revived and redesigned with the help and ideas from young people, who took part in Whitefriars Housing's summer 'Boot Camp' project.![Baroness Newlove at Wellington Gardens](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2021762)

### Helping young people improve their life chances

The Boot Camp course - the first of its kind to be run by a housing association - involved youngsters, some of whom, had been involved in low level anti-social behaviour taking part in a week of activities with the housing association. The course included physical challenges, CV writing, interview skills, and fundraising and community projects aimed at helping young people improve their life chances, with the most-improved going on to secure an apprenticeship with the housing organisation.

Baroness Newlove said:

> ""Young people have a really important role to play in helping to create stronger happier and safer communities. Instead of looking at them as part of the problem, it's far better to include them as part of the solution. They need only to be channelled in the right direction to release all their positive energy. Their bright ideas, creativity and enthusiasm can make a real and positive difference to their local neighbourhood.
> 
> ""It's so heart warming to see projects such as those run by Whitefriars housing. Their belief in the potential of young people to turn their lives around and make a positive contribution to the local area has not only led to the creation of this wonderful memorial garden that can be enjoyed by the whole community but it has also given these young people new skills that will help them on their way to a brighter future.""

Seventeen-year-old Katy O'Beirne, from Cheylesmore, was named the winner of Boot Camp and is now a housing apprentice with Whitefriars. Speaking at the Rose Community Centre, where local residents were shown a film of the success of Boot Camp, she said:

> ""Boot Camp gave me an opportunity to turn my life around and I really enjoyed the things we did.
> 
> ""I love being an apprentice and I want to work hard because I really value the opportunity I have been given.""

The memorial garden includes a sculpture from renowned Coventry-born sculptor Walter Ritchie, who died in 1997. Walter's partner Sally Taylor attended the official opening.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/corporate/2041715,Communities come together to show their enthusiasm for neighbourhood planning,"Communities came together on Monday 28 November 2011 to discuss how new planning powers are allowing them to shape the look and feel of their neighbourhoods.

Neighbourhood Planning gives communities a real voice in deciding the look and feel of development in their area. For the first time local people have a say over the location of new homes, the shops they want to see in the High Street and the design of buildings. They are also able to decide on the green spaces they want protected.

Community representatives from 23 of the frontrunner projects trialling new neighbourhood planning powers learnt from each other ways to develop plans. They were able to share experiences of best practice first hand and highlight any challenges faced and overcome as part of the process.

Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark, who joined the event to hear people's experience of the process, said:

> ""This event demonstrated the real enthusiasm around the country for neighbourhood planning. People are genuinely eager to learn how to shape development in their area and bring about the homes, jobs and shops they want.
> 
> ""We've already got 126 communities trialling powers and have had many more communities telling us they are eager to grasp this opportunity to make their own decisions on planning. There's a real appetite to bring forward sustainable development from people who for too long have been shut out of the planning process with no real voice.""

The Department's officials were on hand to answer questions along with representatives from Locality, Planning Aid (part of the Royal Town Planning Institute), the Campaign to Protect Rural England (who were also representing the National Association of Local Councils), and the Prince's Foundation for the Built Environment - the organisations that have received funding to provide practical advice on neighbourhood planning to communities.

The Localism Act will introduce powers that gives local people the power to decide the types of development that can be granted automatic planning permission, through a Neighbourhood Development Order.

David Cameron was in attendance along with Cabinet ministers including Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles, Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith and Home Secretary Theresa May, as well as Head of Troubled Families Policy Louise Casey.

Welcoming guests to Number 10 the Prime Minister expressed his ""passion"" for the project which is turning around the lives of the 120,000 most challenging families in England in the next three years.

The reception came on the day that the Department for Communities and Local Government launched its unique payment by results programme that will reward upper tier local authorities with up to £4,000 per family if they get children off the streets and into school; reduce youth crime and antisocial behaviour; and put parents on a path back to work.![David Cameron meets with local authority leaders and community workers at a reception at No10 to mark the start of troubled families initiative.](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2121413)

The 10 authorities with the largest amount of troubled families, amounting to a fifth of those that are being targeted, are all signed up to the £448 million scheme and ready to begin work in the new financial year with many more expected in the coming months. All 152 top-tier council chief executives were invited to the event along with new Troubled Families Co-ordinators and frontline workers from the public and voluntary sectors.

The Prime Minister told guests that:

> ""It's great to have so many people here from local government and so many people from different organisations and institutes that care about families. Today we're celebrating a step forward in the programme of trying to deal with the most troubled families, and that is producing the payment by results model to make money available for local authorities.
> 
> ""We all know there are some deeply troubled families in our country who are responsible for a huge amount of social problems, for themselves but also for the wider community - the children aren't going to school, the parents aren't in work, they are responsible for a huge amount of crime and antisocial behaviour, and they are deeply, deeply chaotic.
> 
> ""I am very proud of the fact that this Government has decided to roll up its sleeves and really try and deal with these problems, it's a hugely important area of work.""

Also speaking at the event, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles added that:

> ""We've brought the Government together, but the most important thing is this: that we all in this room - whether you're a politician, a chief executive, somebody from a charity - we have a real chance of turning these lives around.
> 
> ""We talk about the money its costing, but it is a human waste. People on a system that's leading nowhere, and we've got a chance to make a difference, and I am very much looking forward to working with all of you in the months to come.""

The Skills Place Newham based at Westfield Stratford City is a one-stop shop that provides pre and post-employment training in industries such as retail, hospitality and leisure. Mr Neill met some of the local residents benefiting from the training programs and spoke with the staff working to help them move into employment.

The Skills Place Newham focuses on the core skills needed within specific industries and responds to the needs of employers. The courses are designed to help people to build their skills towards finding sustainable employment. It offers advice, career development, apprenticeships and employment that will help ensure a lasting legacy for the local community after the Olympic Games.

In the last year more than 5,000 local residents have received training from Newham and the Skills Place, of which more than 3,000 have subsequently been employed in Westfield Stratford City.

Local Government Minister Bob Neill said:

> ""Skills Place is doing a fantastic job in helping local people gain meaningful employment. The people I have met are a real testament to how the Olympic Games and the subsequent regeneration, is providing opportunities for the people of Newham which will last long after the Games have finished.""

John Burton, Director, Westfield Stratford City, said:

> ""The Skills Place Newham demonstrates how working in partnership and sharing a commitment to create genuine social change can achieve tangible results for the local community. With more than 3,000 local people employed at Westfield Stratford City via the facilities provided at the Skills Place Newham, we are pleased that the Minister chose to visit Westfield Stratford City to see what can be achieved when big business takes its community responsibility seriously.""

The Skills Place Newham is a joint initiative run by employment and training provider Seetec in partnership with Westfield Stratford City and Newham Workplace. Bob Neill visited on Tuesday, 8 May 2012.

The city also launched the [I Love MCR campaign](http://www.manchester.gov.uk/info/100009/events_leisure_and_tourism/5228/i_love_mcr) (external link) to demonstrate pride in the city and encourage people back to shop, eat, drink and socialise in the city.
  * [Ealing Council](http://www.ealing.gov.uk/homepage/64/riot_recovery) (external link) has a £250,000 fund to help independent traders that suffered damage from vandals and looters, helping them pay for things like new glazing and building repairs. The council has also offered interest free repayable grants to the worst affected small traders, which are likely to have to remain closed for up to six months.
  * [Lambeth Council](http://www.lambeth.gov.uk/News/2011/220811LambethBusinessCommunitiesWorkingTogether.htm) (external link) has been holding 'drop in' surgeries for businesses to learn more about the recovery support available, how to apply for funds to tide them over while they get back on their feet again, and get help filling out compensation forms.

The support packages were part of concerted, cross-Government action to help rebuild communities, open up shops and buildings which were damaged, make sure people who lost their homes were re-housed, and to help councils get their areas back to normal as quickly as possible. The measures announced included:

  * a £10million Recovery Scheme which was put in place to help councils with the immediate costs of making their areas safe, clear and clean again, and to enable them to provide council tax discounts to affected residents.
  * a £20million High Street Support Scheme to support Small and Medium sized business affected by the disturbances by providing business rate hardship relief, rebuilding confidence and helping affected businesses get back up and running.
  * a £1million Homelessness Support Scheme which met the immediate costs of re-housing those made homeless by the disturbances with a maximum payment threshold of up to £5,000 per household, with discretion applied for exceptional costs.
  * a £20million London Enterprise Fund to kick-start economic growth and regeneration mainly in Tottenham and Croydon, to be administered by the Mayor of London alongside his £50million recovery fund.

The measures came on top of support for individual homeowners and businesses under the Riot (Damages) Act and local authorities under the Bellwin Scheme, and a £3million 'High Street Fund' set up with contributions from the Mayor, leading UK companies and local authorities to offer initial recovery grants to small businesses.

This week, the Secretary of State is meeting with the leaders of those local authorities affected by the riots to discuss how to restore commercial and community confidence in affected areas, and any difficulties they are facing in recovering from the disturbances or any barriers that need addressing.

And whilst areas are given time to recover and return to normality, they have pledged to continue to work closely with councils and provide support at a national level to ensure that every business forced to close, and every family forced to move, are helped back into their community as quickly as possible.

The report from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors says:

> ""Government announcements are already showing signs of impacting on the market. Surveyors report that the decision to abolish HIPs has pushed more supply onto the market. This trend is likely to continue in the near term.""

Grant Shapps said:

> ""The new Government is getting our economy moving. By acting quickly to cut the red tape of Home Information Packs, we've provided a helping hand to get the housing market off its feet. It's just got hundreds of pounds cheaper to put up a 'for sale' sign. This is a great time to put your home on the market if you're considering moving.""

Ian Perry, RICS spokesperson, said:

> ""Surveyors are generally confident that sales will continue to pick up over the summer months. The increase in supply as a result of the abolition of HIPs is helping to support this optimism despite continuing concerns about mortgage finance. A higher level of instructions should meanwhile also lead to a flatter trend in house prices in the latter part of the year.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/housing/160262311,New study shows support for new homes,"The British public are far more supportive of new housing developments in their area than commonly thought, according to a new study published today.

Today's _Public Attitudes to Housing_ survey, published by the National Housing and Planning Advisory Unit (NHPAU), finds that more than three quarters of people would support more homes being built in their area, provided that local services such as GP surgeries and schools do not suffer.

Good quality housing design is also important to people with 73 per cent saying they would support the building of more homes if well designed and in keeping with their local area.

Speaking to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) earlier this week, Housing Minister Grant Shapps outlined his plans to introduce incentives for local communities to give the green light to new developments, while at the same time ensuring local services are able to meet the community's needs.

He said:

> ""If we are really serious about supporting people's aspirations for home ownership, the real prize is we must build more homes. For the first time incentives will create direct benefits for local communities, bringing jobs, investment and more homes for local people.
> 
> ""Rather than being told what to build and where, residents of villages, towns and cities will be able to develop their own vision for their place.""

Today's NHPAU survey also shows that while the vast majority of people aspire to own their own homes, their efforts are still being hampered by the economic downturn. While 82 per cent see home ownership as preferable to renting and other forms of tenure, three quarters of 25-34 year olds who do not own a home and expect to rent for the next three years, want to buy but cannot afford to do so.

In his speech to RICS, Mr Shapps heralded the return of an Age of Aspiration for new homeowners, and committed the Coalition Government's support for those struggling to get their first foothold on the housing ladder.

He said:

> ""I believe that it is human nature to aspire to shelter and security - and for the many that means owning the roof over your own head.
> 
> ""And I don't consider it my job as Housing Minister to hold those aspirations back.
> 
> ""With a new Government and despite the enormous financial difficulties the country faces, I want to state clearly today:
> 
> ""The Age of Aspiration is back.""

It comes as the Minister outlines the findings of his review of Communities and Local Government schemes providing support to homeowners at risk of repossession.

The Council for Mortgage Lenders has forecast that there will be 53,000 repossessions in 2010. With this in mind, Mr Shapps has decided to refocus the Mortgage Rescue Scheme so it benefits homeowners in need while providing value for money for taxpayers, with a reduction in the grant rate paid to Housing Associations and tighter caps on property price and repair costs.

Using their knowledge of the needs of their communities, councils will help to deliver the scheme alongside their local housing associations to ensure that the scheme is targeted at homeowners who are most likely to benefit from it. The longer term role for the Mortgage Rescue Scheme will be considered through the Spending Review.

### Homeowner Mortgage Support

Launched in April 2009, the Homeowners Mortgage Support Scheme has only helped 34 people although research to be published shortly shows that it has had a positive impact on lender forbearance practice and mortgage arrears management.

Because of low administrative costs, the Minister has decided that the Support Scheme will remain as a backstop that maybe needed if interest rates rise. It will close as planned at the end of the financial year.

Mr Shapps is also stepping up work with partner organisations, such as [Shelter](http://www.shelter.org.uk) and [Citizens Advice](http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/) (external links), to promote the help available to struggling homeowners.

But the Minister believes the most effective thing the Government is doing to help homeowners is tackling the record deficit and preventing the need for rapid increases in interest rates.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""The most effective thing the Government can do for homeowners is to tackle the record deficit and avoid the need for rapid increases in interest rates. But there must still be effective help on hand for those struggling to pay their mortgages.
> 
> ""So today I can confirm that the Mortgage Rescue Scheme and Homeowners Mortgage Support Scheme remain available as a last resort to homeowners facing the real threat of repossession.
> 
> ""But the most effective thing anyone with money worries can do is to not bury their heads in the sand, seek early advice and speak to their lender to avoid losing their home. I would urge people to visit [www.direct.gov.uk/mortgagehelp](http://www.direct.gov.uk/mortgagehelp) (external link), or contact organisations like Citizens Advice for free advice on taking control of their finances.""

Independent money saving expert Martin Lewis said:

> ""Mortgage repossession's a catastrophic threat for struggling families, and anything that's done to help them ride it out is crucial. The most important rule is get help as soon as possible - fighting repossession when they're coming for your house is too late, instead act as soon as you spot the potential for trouble and possible arrears.
> 
> ""The help at hand means some who qualify will have their mortgage interest paid for them, others will be allowed to postpone paying both through official government scheme and improved lender leniency and a few may have their house part bought.
> 
> ""So the golden rule is if you're in trouble speak to your lender asap and a non profit agency like [Citizens Advice](http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/) or [National Debtline](http://www.nationaldebtline.co.uk/) for help plus visit Money Saving Expert and DirectGov and you may find its easier to start sleeping at night.""

### Help and advice for struggling homeowners

Anyone with mortgage worries can go to [www.direct.gov.uk/mortgagehelp](http://www.direct.gov.uk/mortgagehelp) where they can get impartial advice, find out the steps they can take to keep their home and prepare an action plan to tackle their own finances. Free debt advice is also available from organisations including [Citizens Advice](http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/), [Shelter](http://www.shelter.org.uk) and [National Debtline](http://www.nationaldebtline.co.uk/) (external links).

The Financial Services Authority has also recently introduced tough new rules on lenders so repossession remains the last resort, and so those in arrears who have come to an agreement on repayment are treated fairly.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/housing/1719692,"Bob Neill confirms new jobs, homes and a new town centre","Thousands of new jobs and new homes are expected to accompany a new £600 million town centre for Canning Town in the Thames Gateway, announced Minister for Thames Gateway Bob Neill.

Bob Neill's first visit to the Thames Gateway as a Minister coincided with the announcement that Morrisons would be the new retail partner for the £600 million scheme, which is expected to create 3,500 jobs and 10,000 new homes.

The Minister praised the innovative use of public land ahead of building work. Local people are being given the chance to use and enjoy interim community allotments on what would have been a vacant site until development starts.

At DP World, the new port and logistics park at London Gateway in South Essex, Mr Neill helped name the new Stanford Wharf Nature Reserve. The wildlife habitat is 30 times the size of Trafalgar Square and already home to over 200,000 animals relocated as part of the construction process.

The Minister also helped capture several slow worms at the construction site for the new port before travelling to the RSPB's West Canvey Marsh to release the reptiles safely back into the wild.

Bob Neill said:

> ""I am extremely pleased to be in the Thames Gateway for the first time as a minister and to see for myself the scope and the scale of its transformation.
> 
> ""It's taken a lot of hard work and co-operation to get here and the Thames Gateway is taking shape, changing the landscape in many ways. World class trading facilities, new jobs and training opportunities are being created side by side with wildlife habitats, valuable green spaces and homes for the local community.
> 
> ""The Government is committed to the Thames Gateway, and to helping its people have a say in its future by stepping back and giving decision making power back to councils and the Mayor of London. We will still be there when needed - but we're putting the Thames Gateway back into local hands.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/housing/1896913,Government to fund housing advice service for older people,"Making decisions to move home or change utility provider can be hard work and for some older people it can simply be too much. The different processes, prices, range of suppliers, can be daunting when on your own, have not done it for years, or on a limited income, so that not making expensive mistakes is even more important.

The place to get assistance may be FirstStop.

FirstStop is a free, independent, information and advice service for older people, their families and carers, and aims to help older people make informed decisions about their housing options and support, and to help them maintain independent living in later life. The service is provided through a dedicated telephone line and website. After two years of operation FirstStop is delivering information to increasing numbers - currently 130,000 in a year - of older people and families.

As part of the Coalition Government's commitment to help protect older and vulnerable people, the Department for Communities and Local Government has today confirmed funding of £1.5m over two years in 2011-12 and 2012-13 for FirstStop.

Announcing funding for First Stop, Communities Minister Bob Neill said:

> ""As we all get older, we still want to retain our independence and our home and it is one of the Coalition Government's aims to enable people to do this.
> 
> ""But we all know that housing choices in later life are often complex and so the Government is helping by supporting the provision of information and advice from those best able to provide it. That is why today I am announcing the £1.5m funding for First Stop.""

One of the people whom First Stop has helped is Stourport resident Susan Albert.

Living in a crumbling home was the situation of 64 year-old Susan Albert in Stourport. She had no working cooking or bathing facilities and only one coal fire providing the heat. Mrs Albert had lived there for 30 years, but was now sleeping on the sofa downstairs and eating all her meals at the local cafe, or relying on cuppa-soups. Widowed a year earlier, and not in good health, she was now on her own as her two children had long ago moved away from the area and were not able to help her.

![Susan Albert](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1896944)

Fortunately a friend thinking that a home improvement loan might help approached the local Care and Repair Agency, who put her in touch with First Stop.

FirstStop Advice worker Elisa Steery* set up a meeting with Susan Albert at the local cafe, and they talked about what Susan would really like to do about her home and started to explore her options. Mrs Albert explained that she would prefer to downsize to live in a more manageable modernised property. Coping with the building works that her home clearly needed would be hard for her to do.

Elisa helped her to organise a survey on her home, which revealed that it failed on all four counts of the Decent Homes Standard. As a result Mrs Albert joined the local choice-based lettings scheme in a priority band.

Working with the local housing association, Elisa helped Mrs Albert bid for ground floor flats in the area as they became available. Elisa also turned ""Sherlock Holmes"" to find the deeds to the family home, and then helped get it to auction via a local estate agent. Once Mrs Albert's old property has been sold at auction, Elisa will organise for a FirstStop financial adviser to visit to discuss the best options for investing her capital.

Mrs Albert has now moved to a ground floor apartment with a level access shower, in a good location with easy access to shops and a GP surgery. Elisa has ensured that Susan Albert is getting all the social support benefits to which she is entitled and helped her to organise changes of address and swap accounts for gas and electric.

![Susan Albert](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1897508)

Using the Government funds FirstStop will develop sustainable revenue streams and achieve independence from public funding. It will continue to develop partnerships with local authorities, charities and home improvement agencies, to offer an integrated casework service 'support to move' (often called downsizing) service to more vulnerable clients, and to provide a phone support service for clients who can be helped without this more intensive face-to-face support. It will also continue to train housing and other professionals to offer integrated housing, care and finance advice to older people, their families and carers; and to develop peer-to-peer advice skills among older volunteers through, for examples, partnerships with local older people's forums.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/housing/200346811,HomeSwap Direct offers fresh opportunities for social tenants,"The Government's new national _'HomeSwap Direct'_ scheme will make it easier for tenants living in a council or housing association home to find a new property in another part of the country.

_ ![Image: aerial view of houses](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1617201.jpg)HomeSwap Direct_ will mean that for the first time there will be a system in place across the whole of the UK, meaning that tenants looking to move, whether for a job, to be near family or to a property better suited to their needs, will be able to see all the available homes across the whole of the UK, not just those on the website subscribed to by their current landlord.

Some councils such as Kettering already run localised schemes but _Homeswap Direct_ will link them all together across England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales.

One couple used Homeswapper to find a home closer to the family, who had relocated across the country, meaning a 250 mile round trip every few weeks to see them.

They said:

> ""It took us less than three months to find our perfect home swap. We could have moved sooner but we wanted to make sure the house was perfect as we knew once we had moved closer to the children we would settle there.
> 
> ""Our new home is very similar our old bungalow, which we loved, but has a very important added benefit; our family are now just around the corner. Without HomeSwapper it could have taken years for us to have been moved nearer to our family. It's easy and simple and we'd recommend it to anyone looking to move.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/housing/2060020,Grant Shapps: New deal will help older people live at home for longer,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today launched a new deal to help older people to continue living comfortably in their own homes - with particular support for those leaving hospital.

With nearly one in five of the whole population expected to be aged 65 or over by 2020, Ministers are determined to ensure elderly, vulnerable people get the help they need to live independent lives, and can be safe in the knowledge that they won't get ripped off by dodgy dealers and fraudsters.

So Mr Shapps has given £51 million towards Home Improvement Agencies, who will provide help and advice including:

  * housing advice, including help to move to more suitable accommodation if needed
  * handyperson services, including small home repairs, home safety and security adaptations
  * energy efficiency advice; and
  * arranging for adaptations and home repairs to be made, including grab rails, stair-lifts and major work such as ground floor extensions.

These agencies also offer hospital discharge services - ensuring older people leaving hospital care are given the support they need to be able to recuperate in the comfort of their own homes.

For those needing adaptations to their homes, Grant Shapps has also confirmed an additional £20 million for Disabled Facilities Grants - bringing the total to £200 million this year alone.

He has also announced £1.5 million funding for FirstStop, which provides independent advice to older people looking to plan their future housing needs - whether in their own homes, or in care homes. This is in addition to work already underway to look at new and innovative ways in which elderly people can fund their future care needs without having to resort to selling their property.

And to plan for the needs of older households in the future, Mr Shapps has announced plans for councils to consider the needs of their ageing residents in their local housing plans, by planning the numbers of new homes built  to ensure they include features that meet the needs of older people, such as wider doors for wheelchairs and walk-in showers.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""As we get older the last thing we want is for our properties to become our prisons. We want to be able to enjoy the comfort of our own homes in our later years. But with nearly a fifth of our population expected to be over 65 by 2020, radical and urgent change is needed to ensure the nation's housing meets the growing and changing demands that this is bringing, and will bring in the future.
>

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/housing/2104857,Industry support grows for NewBuy Guarantee,"Housing industry movers and shakers have hailed today's launch of the NewBuy Guarantee scheme as a vital kick-start for house builders across the country.

The scheme, which will now begin to offer mortgages on newly-built properties to people with just a five per cent deposit, is expected to help up to 100,000 buyers who would otherwise be frozen out of the market.

### Lauded by lenders

From today, 95 per cent loan-to-value mortgages will be available from three major high street lenders, with more expected to follow suit over the coming weeks.

Barclays Head of Mortgages Andy Gray said the NewBuy Guarantee will:

> ""boost housing market confidence and support the flow of new housing"".

Moray McDonald, Mortgages Director for NatWest expressed the hope that increased demand from the scheme:

> ""will help lift the economy via the construction of additional homes"".

And Andrew Baddeley-Chappell, Head of Mortgage Strategy and Policy at Nationwide, said that NewBuy will:

> ""boost the supply of properties and provide affordable mortgages to those with more modest deposits, including first time buyers"".

### Backed by builders

With the NewBuy Guarantee set to support up to 50,000 new jobs, major housebuilders have given their backing to the scheme, which is available only on newly-built properties.

Chief executive at Taylor Wimpey, Pete Redfern, said the NewBuy Guarantee will:

> ""go a long way in helping a wide range of buyers who have had to put their dreams of getting on or moving up the property ladder on hold"".
> 
> ""Availability of affordable mortgages is so often cited by our customers as their main barrier to purchase,"" he added.
> 
> ""Increasing the number of 95 per cent mortgages being offered by lenders should have a significant positive impact on the market.""

Bovis Homes chief executive David Ritchie agreed, saying the need for aspiring homeowners to get much larger deposits together had:

> ""undoubtedly been a significant factor in slowing down the market"".
> 
> ""We want to hit the ground running with NewBuy and there is a real level of commitment among housebuilders, lenders and Government to make it work for the country's homebuyers,"" he said.
> 
> ""This new five per cent deposit requirement promises to give the market a major boost - especially as it is available to existing homeowners and first-time buyers alike.""

Ian Baker of Linden Homes highlighted the demand for new homes, with ""record numbers"" of people visiting the company's sites across the country. He said:

> ""Buyers are telling us that mortgages remain difficult to obtain. And it's not just first time buyers saying this - many existing homeowners are struggling to move into a new home due to a lack of equity in their properties due to a downturn in valuations. We believe NewBuy will further extend a helping hand to people struggling to get onto or step up the property ladder, and its visibility will help to provide buyers with the confidence they had pre-recession that responsible lending is attainable.""

### Support from small and medium sized builders

Over the next few weeks it is expected that a number of smaller developers will be able to offer NewBuy mortgages on a range of sites across the country, alongside the largest housebuilding firms.

These developers have also expressed their support for the scheme as a measure designed not just to help buyers, but also to get Britain building again.

They include Andy Yallop, chief executive at Croudace Homes in Surrey and Hertfordshire, who warned that the constrained mortgage market had had:

> ""an adverse effect both upon our business and the many who wish to buy one of our new homes.""

He described NewBuy as:

> ""an exciting opportunity for us to work together with Government and lenders to unlock the situation, thereby enabling us to provide more new homes to the benefit of both those who wish to buy and those whose jobs it is to build them"".

Mark Connors, managing director at Shepherd Homes in Yorkshire, said it will:

> ""enable our company to create local jobs and give a lift to the area's local economy"", as well as offering;
> 
> ""the opportunity for families to meet their aspirations and own a new home"".

And Ken Whitaker, managing director of Seddon Homes which covers much of Cheshire, Lancashire, Yorkshire and Staffordshire, said:

> ""The flexible nature of the scheme and the way it can be accessed across a range of sites will maximise its impact and generate new activity right across the country.""
> 
> ""As a regional housebuilder this will enable us to build and sell more houses on our patch, generating work and economic activity which will have a direct impact on local jobs and prosperity.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/localgovernment/1587704111111,Scrapping regional bureaucracy will save millions,"Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles is to close down a regional bureaucracy which had been costing £16m a year as part of the Coalition Government's review of spending promises made since the New Year.

Eric Pickles has put plans in motion to move swiftly to dismantle the funding and powers of regional local authority leaders' boards, which took over most of the functions and staff of the old regional assemblies and are part of the bureaucratic regional structures the Coalition Government is committed to scrapping.

The boards are set to become redundant as the complex regime of regional spatial strategies, which wrested powers on transport, housing and planning powers away from local councils, are abolished.

The dismantling of these boards will see local authorities put firmly back in control of delivering the services and provision for their area and will ensure local people can hold their leaders to account.

> ""We are unravelling this complex system, putting the community back in charge of how their area develops and saving the public purse £16m at the same time.""

Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Eric Pickles said:

> ""This is another step in wresting control from the bureaucrats, stopping the top down diktats and axing unelected, ineffective quangos.
> 
> ""This is the nail in the coffin of the unelected, unaccountable and unwanted Regional Assemblies.
> 
> ""We are unravelling this complex system, putting the community back in charge of how their area develops and saving the public purse £16m at the same time.""

Regional leaders boards had an overall budget of £16m per annum - by closing them down, at least £6m will be saved this year from their running costs. The decision will also save local taxpayers money as boards also received funding from local councils of more than £10 million last year.

Two other projects are also being suspended.

  * The Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) and Yorkshire Forward have paused any further investment in the Sevenstone Sheffield retail quarter regeneration project pending a review of whether the project could deliver better value for money and a clearer assessment of risks.
  * Further HCA funding of up to £10m towards the Kent Thameside Strategic Transport Programme has been suspended and will be considered as part of the forthcoming Spending Review.

> ""Good representation is the key to making public institutions responsive to the needs of the people they serve.""

The scheme aims to encourage more people from diverse backgrounds to engage with their council. Fifteen of the women were so inspired that they stood for election in the 6 May poll, four of them winning seats.

The minister spoke alongside Lynne Featherstone, Equalities Minister.

![Image: Andrew Stunell speaking to the BAME Women Councillors Mentoring Scheme](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1615398.jpg)Andrew Stunell said:

> ""Good representation is the key to making public institutions responsive to the needs of the people they serve. The Big Society and Localism are both about inclusiveness and fairness, giving huge potential for women and ethnic minorities to influence decisions. The more we give power back to local bodies, the more important this gets.
> 
> ""Congratulations to all of the women who took part in the scheme. I'm looking forward to working with partners and Ministerial colleagues across government to push the race equality agenda forward and improve opportunities for people of all backgrounds.""

The scheme paired BAME women with local councillors over a six month period, from October 2009 to March 2010 and gave participants first hand knowledge of the roles and responsibilities of councillors, serving officers and an insight into systems and procedures. The aim was that upon completion, the leadership programme would equip and motivate participants to engage in party politics.

One of the participants, Pathuma Ali, commented:

> ""The scheme gave me a fantastic insight into the life of a councillor and really opened doors for me.""

> ""This is an excellent, well-run scheme, which gives people a really good taste of public life. I'm now a councillor and it gave me the push I needed to stand for election.""

Another, Jeya Nadanakumaran, said:

The opportunities to network and make contacts that it provided are so important. I stood for councillor this year and have high ambitions! I would recommend this scheme to anyone.""

The event took place in the House of Commons yesterday (Monday 14 June). The scheme was launched last year by the Government Equalities Office and Operation Black Vote.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/localgovernment/1727272,New rules for town hall papers,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles announced proposals to tighten up the publicity rules for councils so they guard against campaigning with public funds today.

In recent years there has been a major growth in the frequency and scope of council publicity techniques that use taxpayers' money whilst local papers have struggled in a saturated news environment.

Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, Eric Pickles, said:

> ""An independent local press is an essential part of our open democracy helping local people scrutinise and hold elected councillors to account.""

The new consultation proposes rules to stop municipal newspapers being published more than four times a year and to end the hiring of lobbying contractors. They also give more transparency and certainty to local authorities and political parties about conference stalls rules, for example, by distinguishing between the promotion of a local area for tourism purposes and the taxpayer-funded lobbying of politicians.

Mr Pickles added:

> ""The rules around council publicity have been too weak for too long allowing public money to be spent on frivolous town hall propaganda papers that have left many local newspapers looking over the abyss - weakening our free press - or to use 'hired-gun' lobbyists that operate in the shadows to bulldoze special interests through.
> 
> ""The proposals I am publishing today will close off these inappropriate practices and make sure that councils focus taxpayers' money on where it should be spent - protecting frontline services.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/localgovernment/1830719,Final local government settlement a fair deal for communities,"Final arrangements for a fair and progressive funding settlement for councils that protect front-line services and shield the most vulnerable have been published by Local Government Minister Bob Neill.

Councils will only see an average 4.4 per cent reduction in revenue spending power and the grant has been adjusted so none will now face more than an 8.8 per cent fall.

This settlement reflects the desire to support areas with the most need and the urgent obligation to bring the country's public finances back in order, keep interest rates down and prevent the national debt escalating beyond £1.4 trillion of taxpayers' money.

Ministers have consulted widely with the Local Government Association, London Councils and many individual local authorities, listening to concerns raised. Having considered all views, Ministers have today confirmed the proposals for the distribution of formula grant for 2011-12 as announced in December.

Mr Neill said:

> ""We urgently need to reduce the country's public spending and local government accounts for around a quarter of all public expenditure so councils have a big part to play.
> 
> ""We have listened to views and looked hard at the figures and have pushed more money to those most dependent on grant so now no council will face a reduction of more than 8.8 per cent and shire districts will get £10 million to compensate for the loss of concessionary bus travel funding.
> 
> ""These extra steps once again show we have worked to deliver a fair and progressive approach that directs grant to where it is most needed - the vulnerable and needy - whilst protecting taxpayers.""

Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles added:

> ""This goes hand in hand with the new localism powers and spending freedoms we are handing councils so they can be as efficient and effective as possible with public funds, rooting out waste and focusing on frontline public services.""

The final settlement:

  * allocates a total Government Revenue Grant of £72.7 billion to Local Authorities in 2011-12
  * distributes £29.4 billion in formula grant in 2011-12 and £27.1 billion for 2012-13
  * keeps the average revenue spending power reduction for 2011-12 at only 4.4 per cent and reduces the upper limit from 8.9 per cent to 8.8 per cent
  * increases Transitional Grant to £96 million in 2011-12 and £21 million in 2012-13
  * makes a further £10 million available through Formula Grant to compensate Shire Districts for the loss of concessionary travel funding in 2011-12
  * ensures a fair distribution between different parts of the country - north and south, rural and urban, metropolitan and shire
  * creates four new grant bands or 'floors' with different limits that protect those most dependent on grant against potentially steeper reductions

The Coalition Government remains committed to protecting local taxpayers. A growing number of councils have already indicated that they will be taking up the Government offer to fund a council tax freeze in April through its £650 million fund. Authorities who do not increase their council tax are eligible for a grant worth 2.5 per cent of their council tax.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/localgovernment/1874383,Support for new Enterprise Zones grows after Budget announcement,"Plans for a new generation of enterprise zones have received widespread support from the business community including the British Chamber of Commerce, the CBI, the Federation of Small Businesses, entrepreneurs James Dyson and James Averdieck as well as representatives from the first Enterprise Zones in Nottingham and Manchester.

The Budget announced that the Government would create 21 new Enterprise Zones, within local enterprise partnerships, with simplified planning rules, super-fast broadband and tax breaks for businesses, would be established in local enterprise partnerships across England. The areas will have real potential to create new businesses and jobs with wider economic benefits.

The first vanguard Enterprise Zones will be based in Birmingham and Solihull, Sheffield, Leeds, Liverpool, London, Manchester, the Bristol area, the Black Country, Derby and Nottingham, Teesside and the North East.

Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles has launched a scheme to identify where the remaining ten Enterprise Zones. He said that growth was this Government's number one priority and a new generation of Enterprise Zones were central to that strategy adding that the zones were unashamedly pro-growth would be ""a springboard for private sector growth and wider regeneration"".

John Cridland, CBI Director-General, said:

> ""The new enterprise zones could provide positive incentives for local authorities to promote development, allowing the Government to carry out a real-time experiment on what actually works as a spur to economic activity.""

John Walker, National Chairman, Federation of Small Businesses, said:

> ""We are pleased that the Chancellor has introduced a fuel duty stabiliser, has committed to cutting fuel duty and has introduced 21 new Enterprise Zones. This will provide much needed stability for struggling small businesses.""

David Frost, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce said:

> ""The announcement of 21 low-tax, low-regulation areas across England in the form of Enterprise Zones will boost our regional economies. The role of Local Enterprise Partnerships in designating and running Enterprise Zones will ensure that local business leaders are at the heart of the new policy. Beyond upfront incentives, the reinvestment of business rates locally is critical to boosting regional growth.""

British Retail Consortium Director General Stephen Robertson said:

> ""The Chancellor is right to seek to stimulate regional private sector growth, especially in parts of the country which have been particularly dependent on the public sector. Enterprise zones can make a difference at the margins but they must not disadvantage neighbouring areas.""

Dr Brian Sloan, Head of Business and Economic Policy at Greater Manchester Chamber of Commerce, said:

> ""Given the challenges facing the Greater Manchester economy at this time, this announcement is obviously great news for the area. The new Enterprise Zone should provide employment opportunities for many people who will prosper from investment and development on this scale.""

George Cowcher, CEO of the Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire Chamber of Commerce, said:

> ""We're absolutely delighted that Nottingham has been chosen as the location of one of the first four Enterprise Zones. It's a fantastic coup which reflects the importance of Nottingham, a core city to the UK economy and a driver of private sector growth.""

Inventor and entrepreneur James Dyson said:

> ""These are real serious measures which will make it much more likely for people to invest in these high risk start-ups - and also for people with these technology ideas to want to do it themselves.""

Royal Institute of British Architects President Ruth Redd said:

> ""The RIBA welcomes the potential for streamlining the planning system and for promoting development in enterprise zones provided that they are achieved in a framework that protects the essential requirements of sustainability and good design.""

Alexandra Jones, boss of the Centre for Cities, said:

> ""They are locating the new zones in areas where there is a realistic chance of producing growth, rather than focusing on reviving rundown areas which weren't realistically going to produce new jobs.""

Gu desserts founder, James Averdieck, in reaction to the Enterprise Zones announcement in the Budget said:

> ""Continued growth in the economy is the only way Britain will emerge unscathed from the recession and I, for one, applaud the Chancellor's initiative.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/localgovernment/1884740,'Backdoor' bin charging not allowed,"The Coalition Government is today reminding local councils not to exceed their legal powers by imposing 'backdoor' bin taxes.

In a joint letter to all councils, Environment Minister Lord Henley and Local Government Minister Bob Neill raise serious concerns that, through the Waste Review being carried out it has become clear that a small minority of councils are seeking to charge for bin bags or for the collection of normal household rubbish. Councils were accordingly reminded of the law and instructed to stop the spread of such practice.

The letter states: ""councils cannot introduce 'backdoor' bin charging for mainstream waste collections or waste disposal. Such stealth taxes are not legal and are contrary to the policy direction of the new Government.""

Section 45 (3) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 specifically bars local authorities from making a charge for the collection of household waste, except in cases prescribed in regulations.

The Localism Bill is ending the legislation which allowed for the introduction and roll-out of new taxes for the collection of household bins. The new Government has also cancelled the pilot schemes for these new bin taxes.

Eric Pickles, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government said:

> ""We are stopping municipal officials from levying unfair backdoor bin taxes. Families pay £120 a month in council tax - they deserve a comprehensive and frequent bin collection service in return without bin bag charges on top. Bin charging harms the environment by rewarding fly-tipping and backyard burning.""

Caroline Spelman, Secretary of State for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs added:

> ""We want it to make it as easy as possible for people to do the right thing and dispose of their waste responsibly. Measures such as additional charging or petty officialdom simply make life difficult for hard-pressed families and pose additional threats to the environment from fly tipping and other socially irresponsible behaviour.""

Councils were also informed that as part of the Waste Review, due to report in May, the Government is reviewing the enforcement powers and penalties available to local authorities in relation to waste collection and disposal, to ensure that they are proportionate, relevant and respect civil liberties.

The review is looking at how it can work with local councils to increase the frequency and quality of rubbish collections and make it easier to recycle, to tackle measures which encourage councils specifically to cut the scope of collections; and to address public concerns over the civil liberty aspects of inappropriate enforcement practices associated with household collections.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/localgovernment/1897064,Residents pool together to save community baths,"Derbyshire has got its first new swimming pool for 25 years thanks to the actions of some community minded locals. Gayton pool opened in January 2011 after residents in Littleover campaigned to keep their local pool open. The result was a new £1 million pool which has enabled local residents and children to benefit from a range of swimming lessons.

The success of Gayton pool demonstrates what can happen when communities come together and take over the running of a service from the local authority. The Localism Bill will give communities the right to challenge their council on decisions that directly affect them and enable local residents to take charge of their community to run services themselves.

Built and paid for in the 1970s the original pool was closed in 2007 after years of neglect and a lack of funds to pay for vital maintenance costs.

In response, local residents set up the Blagreaves Community Action Group. Gayton Community Association, who had a hand in the original building of the pool, launched a legal challenge against the council, claiming that the building's lease obliged the authority to take action.

The dedication of local residents, some of whom even remortgaged their homes to raise enough funds to take the case to court, paid off as the association won the case. This resulted in the council demolishing the old pool and building a brand new one.

### Community controlled

Operation of the pool is now community based as Gayton Pool Limited, a subsidiary of Lonsdale Swimming and Sports Trust, has won a five year contract to run and manage the pool on behalf of the council.

Ian Cotter, Chairman, Lonsdale Swimming and Sports Trust and Managing Director of Gayton Pool Limited explained how the new pool was already making a difference to the local community; 

> ""The new Gayton pool is a marvellous facility for the local community and will enable many more to learn to swim and take part in water activities.
> 
> ""The main focus at Gayton will be on swimming lessons and schools use. We have been operating the pool now for 3 months and we have over 400 children learning to swim every week amongst the 800 people who are using it. Those who campaigned hard for the pool can now see the fruits of their labours in the success of it at such an early stage.""

The pool has made a splash in the local community and has proved to be a resounding success, offering a range of swimming lessons for adults and children, aqua fit classes, family sessions and splash parties.

Gayton Community Association have shown the positive outcomes that can be achieved when a community challenges their council on the decisions that directly affect them.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/localgovernment/1918395,Volunteers save local Tourist Information Point,"Dedicated volunteers in the picturesque town of Easingwold, North Yorkshire, have worked together to keep their local Tourist Information Point open. The group of 50 volunteers set up a steering group and began discussions with the council to prove they could successfully run the facility themselves.

The Localism Bill has been introduced to help communities do just this. By shifting power from central government into the hands of citizens, communities can take responsibility for vital services and decide how they should be run. Those who know their local area best know what services they require, and the residents of Easingwold knew how important the Tourist Information Point was for their community.

The centre was able to remain open with the aid of grants from Hambleton District Council and North Yorkshire County Council. Hambleton District Council also helped by leasing the premises at a low rent and small lottery grants have assisted with the production of leaflets and a website.

![Image of Easingwold Tourist Information Centre](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1919304)

As the office is run solely by volunteers, annual running costs are a low £1500, and are met by various fundraising activities, the proceeds of which go back into the Tourist Information Point.

The knowledge the volunteers have of the local area is beneficial to both visitors and the wider community, who can benefit from increased business and tourism. Many of the volunteers are of retirement age so have the opportunity to re-use their skills, pass on their knowledge and put something back into the community.

The future looks bright for the Tourist Information Point and it will soon celebrate its fourth birthday. A ten-year lease has also been secured on the premises, enabling the volunteers to consider the long-term plans for the facility.

Other communities seem to be following the example set by the volunteers of Easingwold, as Treasurer and Secretary, Frank Johnston-Banks said:

> ""We are becoming well known for what we do and how well we do it, with the result that other similar centres visit us to find our secret. But there is no secret. If somebody gets paid, they do the job because they have to. If somebody volunteers they do the job because they want to - and they put more into it, resulting in a better organisation"".

With this sort of ethos sitting at the heart of the office, it seems as though the next ten years will be just as successful. The volunteers have demonstrated the amazing achievements of a group who united together for a cause that has clear long-term benefits for the wider community.

Held in the seaside setting of Clacton, the conference discussed how seaside towns can become economic hubs and shared success stories from as far a field as France, Italy, and Malta.

The event was hosted by Tendring District Council, Essex County Council and the Council of Europe.

Communities Minister Bob Neill said:

> ""Event's like this are an important way to highlight to unique role coastal areas and seaside towns play in Britain's history, culture and economy.
> 
> ""Come rain or shine we all have fond memories of trips to the Great British Seaside, but they are more than holiday destinations we also need to ensure they are great places to live and work. Many seaside towns are showing how they can become year round places of business given the opportunity.
> 
> ""The Government is committed to rebalancing local economies through local enterprise partnerships and small business tax breaks as well as by putting local people back in charge of their own economic growth through neighbourhood plans and community incentives like the New Homes Bonus.""

Neil Stock, Leader of Tendring District Council, said:

> ""Businesses are willing to invest if they get the right messages from the public sector. It is up us to create the right environment for them to operate and draw in the money which will lead to more jobs and regeneration in Tendring.""

### Communities back in control

Putting local authorities and communities back in charge and giving them the freedom to drive their own economic development and growth is a key priority for the Government:

  * Through the Localism Bill, the Government is devolving greater powers to councils and neighbourhoods, so local communities are able to shape their own future.

  * The Government has invited local business and local councils to come together and take charge of their local economy and establish local enterprise partnerships. The new network of 35 Local Enterprise partnerships covers 95 per cent of all businesses and 96 per cent of the population in England.

  * Kent, Greater Essex and East Sussex local enterprise partnerships, who attended the conference, are already working together and have set up a new group to look at some of the issues facing the coastal towns in their area.

  * To further encourage investment across the country the Government is creating 21 new Enterprise Zones to be developed within the local enterprise partnerships. Businesses in Enterprise Zones will benefit from superfast broadband, lower business tax rates, low levels of regulation and planning controls, and reduced business rates.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/localgovernment/19893261,Tackling skills gap in Solent,"Helping drive growth and tackle unemployment is one of the key roles of Local Enterprise Partnerships and one Local Enterprise Partnership tackling the challenges head on is Solent. Its innovative apprenticeship training scheme, Solent Apprentices for Business (Solent A4B) has already seen results in placing apprentices with employers in and around Southampton.

The Solent Local Enterprise Partnership worked with the Partnership for Urban South Hampshire (PUSH) Employment and Skills board and the London Apprenticeship Company to develop the one-stop-shop Apprenticeship Training Agency service helping employers and job seekers alike.

In the first four months since launching, Solent A4B has helped 25 apprentices into positions with 13 organisations, most of which are small or medium enterprises. A further 13 vacancies are currently in the process of being filled. Solent's aim is that 60 apprentices will be placed by 31 March 2012 as more firms in the Solent area sign up.

Brian Luff, Chairman of Critical Software Ltd, said:

> ""We've noticed a distinct lack of graduates with the right skills and knowledge in recent years, so we've decided to augment our approach to recruitment with this new scheme. So many young people are understandably being deterred from going to university due to rising fees and we feel that we can find the right people at a much earlier stage in their careers and work with them to develop skills we know they'll use later in their careers.""

Solent is one of 38 partnerships that represent 99 per cent of the population of England and cover 99 per cent of all businesses in England. Local Enterprise Partnerships were established on 28 October 2010 following the launch of the Local Growth White Paper.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/localgovernment/2017222,HomeSwap Direct offers fresh opportunities for social tenants,"The Government's new national _'HomeSwap Direct'_ scheme will make it easier for tenants living in a council or housing association home to find a new property in another part of the country.

_ ![Image: aerial view of houses](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1617201.jpg)HomeSwap Direct_ will mean that for the first time there will be a system in place across the whole of the UK, meaning that tenants looking to move, whether for a job, to be near family or to a property better suited to their needs, will be able to see all the available homes across the whole of the UK, not just those on the website subscribed to by their current landlord.

Some councils such as Kettering already run localised schemes but _Homeswap Direct_ will link them all together across England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales.

One couple used Homeswapper to find a home closer to the family, who had relocated across the country, meaning a 250 mile round trip every few weeks to see them.

They said:

> ""It took us less than three months to find our perfect home swap. We could have moved sooner but we wanted to make sure the house was perfect as we knew once we had moved closer to the children we would settle there.
> 
> ""Our new home is very similar our old bungalow, which we loved, but has a very important added benefit; our family are now just around the corner. Without HomeSwapper it could have taken years for us to have been moved nearer to our family. It's easy and simple and we'd recommend it to anyone looking to move.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1592737,Pickles and Shapps announce HIPs are history,"![Eric Pickles, Kirsty Allsop and Grant Shapps cutting housing market red tape](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1592620.jpg)Communities Secretary Eric Pickles and Housing Minister Grant Shapps have announced that, with immediate effect, Home Information Packs (HIPs) are suspended.

_Location, Location, Location_ presenter Kirstie Allsopp joined Mr Pickles and Mr Shapps on a visit to an estate agents in Battersea, London today to hear how the suspension of HIPs will help the fragile housing market. 

### Less cost and less hassle

Mr Pickles said that the suspension will show those thinking of selling their home that they can put it on the market with less cost and less hassle.

HIPs will no longer hold back the housing market by forcing sellers to fork out extra cash, sometimes hundreds of pounds, just to be able to put their home up for sale.

Mr Pickles and Mr Shapps also confirmed that in order to help people reduce their energy bills and tackle climate change, sellers will still be required to produce an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) when they sell their home.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""The expensive and unnecessary Home Information Pack has increased the cost and hassle of selling homes and is stifling a fragile housing market.
> 
> ""HIPs are history. This action will encourage sellers back into the market, and help the market as a whole and the economy recover.""

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""This is a great example of how this new Government is getting straight down to work by cutting away pointless red-tape that is strangling the market.
> 
> ""Rather than shelling out hundreds of pounds for nothing in return we're stripping away bureaucracy and letting home owners sell their properties.""

Kirsty Allsop said:

> ""I work with people buying and selling their houses every day and I've seen genuine unhappiness. Today's the day that HIPs are gone. You will not have to pay £250, or £350 plus VAT, for a piece of paper that no one will look at and will not reduce your lawyer's fees.""

### Impact of HIPs suspension

Following on from the Secretary of State Eric Pickles' and Housing Minister Grant Shapps' suspension of Home Information Packs, Estate Agents have suggested an increase in housing market activity (see links to some of the media coverage on the right).

Commenting on the £6.2billion of savings in 2010-11, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""The spending decisions we have outlined today show our determination to help tackle the immense public deficit the new Government has inherited, whilst shielding council services like rubbish collections and social care.
> 
> ""There will be no reduction to the £29bn general grant that local government receives every year meaning that they have the flexibility they need to protect the frontline. But this is also an opportunity to devolve real power to councils. By removing ringfencing and red tape and freeing up resources councils will be free to focus on delivering essential services.
> 
> ""Councils have already made big efficiency savings in recent years. Central government needs to follow that example. We are putting tough controls on Whitehall spending. A radical scaling back of the scope and interference of quangos and putting power with councils and communities will deliver significant savings, ensure services are meeting the needs of the people that use them and cut out waste.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1602678,Eric Pickles calls on councils to crackdown on unauthorised bank holiday building,"Communities and Local Government Secretary of State Eric Pickles is taking pre-emptive action to prevent unauthorised development over this coming bank holiday weekend.

Mr Pickles is writing to all Local Authority Chief Planners to warn them to be on alert and ready for action if any significant planning applications get submitted before the bank holiday.

### Illegal development

In the past some people have used extended weekends to put in last minute applications to their council on the Friday. They then spend the extended weekend illegally developing the land, for example cutting down protected trees or laying concrete driveways. These developments are often at quite an advanced stage by the time council planning officers return after the holiday and are able to call a temporary halt on activity.

### Rapid enforcement action

Mr Pickles is encouraging Councils to have planning officers on call over the weekend, ready to deal with last minute applications and take rapid enforcement action against any unauthorised development. This will also help reduce the volume of retrospective planning applications, which are expensive for the taxpayer, put an unnecessary strain on the planning system and are not fair to the vast majority of people who play by the rules.

Mr Pickles said:

> ""This new coalition government will not stand back and allow a small minority of people to deliberately exploit the extended weekend and planning procedure to carry out unauthorised developments.
> 
> ""That's why I'm calling on councils to take precautionary measures and make sure that they have planning officers ready to deal with any planning applications submitted over the weekend.
> 
> ""We want to ensure fair play in the planning system and as part of this we will be strengthening the powers of councils to tackle unauthorised development.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1622574,Ports businesses welcome tax break,"Port businesses all across the country have welcomed the good news delivered in the Budget that £175 million of backdated business rates demands will now be cancelled following last month's initial freeze.

Local Government Minister Bob Neill said:

> ""The dark tax cloud that has been hanging over some port businesses, the backbone of Britain's export industry, for too long has finally been lifted.
> 
> ""The Chancellor's decision to waive and repay the unexpected rates bills for those affected port businesses is a victory for common sense. Many companies across the country will be able to move forward confidently, unburdened by these unexpected debts. ""

### Looking forward

These unfair, retrospective rates bills had threatened to devastate the export industry which would seriously impact the manufacturing sector. Instead an estimated 700 port-based properties out of a total 3,000 properties across the country could now benefit from this budget decision.

Already a number of businesses are looking forward to a better future:

Andrew Finfer, acting on behalf of affected ports businesses said: 

> ""Port businesses welcome the Chancellor's commitment to abolish and repay the unfair backdated liability to pay rates that has caused so much damage to port businesses.  The businesses and their customers can look forward with confidence to the future unburdened from and no longer distracted by the imposition of unfair taxes that have damaged the industry's competitive advantage. 
> 
> We have no doubt that the Government honouring its pledges will enable businesses to survive, to invest and to create additional employment.""

Jens Nielsen, Managing Director of Shipping Company DFDS Tor Line added,

> ""This has been a long, hard campaign and we are delighted to now see the new Government deliver on its manifesto promises. We have been extremely impressed with the speed with which this matter has been handled and the also the willingness to listen and engage fully with the ports community. The Government has restored our confidence in British politics and we now look forward to again moving our Business forward""

Karl Howarth, Chief Financial Officer of P&O Ferries, said:

> ""We're pleased that at long last we have a government that understands the huge difficulties caused by the port rates debacle and their promise to resolve the issue so that businesses can concentrate on their businesses going forward without this considerable millstone holding them back.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1624036,Less red tape and more accountability,"Councils will be freed from wasting millions of public pounds and thousands of man hours reporting back to Government, with the start of a new era of transparency and public accountability, enabling councils to focus more on frontline services.

Secretary of State Eric Pickles has written to council leaders to tell them that he has instructed the Audit Commission and five other local inspectorates to stop costly top-down reports officially known as the Comprehensive Area Assessments (CAA).

Ministers believe that ending CAA will save the Audit Commission £10 million, and councils will also feel the financial benefit, as independent research put the average annual cost of reporting back to government at £1.8m. In 2006 the National Audit Office estimated the overall cost of monitoring local government at £2 billion a year.

Ministers and Council leaders discuss the end of CAA

### Transparency and public accountability, not Whitehall red-tape

Communities and Local Government Secretary, Eric Pickles said:

> ""In the face of the nation's £156bn deficit, Central Government needs to stop the costly top-down monitoring that is engulfing councils and start trusting them to do what is right locally.
> 
> ""Today I have instructed Town Hall watchdogs to stop tying the hands of council workers with unnecessary red tape and paperwork.
> 
> ""It is much more important for the public to know what their councils are doing than having thousands of hush-hush, unseen papers being sent back and forth between Whitehall bureaucrats and the Town Hall.
> 
> ""We are already pushing power as far away from Whitehall as we can and calling on councils to throw open their books to create much more cost effective and efficient local public services.""

Mr Pickles has called for greater transparency and openness to be the default setting for how councils do their business, publishing all information on the quality of council services online. This will root out wild overspending, expensive mistakes and unnecessary waste saving the public millions.

### Facts and figures:

Leicestershire councils found they had 90 full time staff collecting and processing more than 3,000 individual data items for central government at a cost of £3.7m a year. They also faced 83 different inspections every year.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1626751,"Grant Shapps signals start to housing ""revolution""","Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today confirmed that he will take forward legislation allowing the creation of Local Housing Trusts.

In a speech to the Community Land Trusts conference in London, the Minister confirmed that plans for Local Housing Trusts will be included in the forthcoming Decentralisation and Localism Bill, due to be introduced this Autumn.

Local Housing Trusts would have to show they have the support of the local community for planned housing developments, and would have to meet some basic planning criteria - but would not need to lodge specific planning applications.

Any profits made from new developments would have to be reinvested in the local community, and the land would remain with the housing trust - regardless of what happened to the houses built on top.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps, said:

> ""In opposition I said that if we won the election we would start a revolution - where communities would get involved in providing homes for themselves. Today it's time to start that revolution.
> 
> ""For the first time it will be communities, not central Government, who decide what happens in their local area.
> 
> ""We want local people to decide what happens in their community. Local Housing Trusts should be able to proceed in areas where there is overwhelming support for new developments from people living in the area.
> 
> ""But essentially I want communities to have the freedom to decide on the type and quantity of housing without external restrictions imposed by a centralised planning system. The English villages that captivate the world's imagination were largely built at a time before a planning system existed. They were built by local people to meet their needs.
>

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1628975,Call to arms in battle against red tape,"The Government has issued a call to arms against pointless regulation and unnecessary bureaucracy, launching a new Your Freedom website at [www.hmg.gov.uk/yourfreedom](http://yourfreedom.hmg.gov.uk/) (external link). The site asks the public how they want the Government to redress the balance between the citizen and the state.

![iframe: ](http://download.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/interactive/widgets/freedom-widget.aspx)

The Your Freedom website is an opportunity for anyone to suggest ideas on restoring liberties that have been lost, repealing unnecessary laws and stripping away excessive regulation on businesses.

Your Freedom asks three questions:

  * **Restoring civil liberties**: which current laws would you like to remove or change because they restrict your civil liberties?
  * **Cutting business and charity regulations**: which regulations do you think should be removed or changed to make running your business or organisation as simple as possible?
  * **Repealing unnecessary laws**: which offences do you think we should remove or change and why?

### More sense and less red tape

The public say they only need laws and regulation that makes sense. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles will shortly be asking Councillors and Council staff to suggest how the thick forest of outmoded, outdated and obsolete secondary legislation can be cut down to size. Government wants them to be local leaders not passe pen pushers.

Launching Your Freedom today, the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said:

> ""For too long new laws and regulations have taken away people's freedoms, interfered in everyday life… the state has crept further and further into people's homes, the places they work, their private lives. That intrusion is wrong.
> 
> ""This government is putting freedom under the spotlight. We want the British people have their say on where the state should step in, and where it should butt out. We are asking people for ideas on restoring hard won liberties that have been lost, on repealing unnecessary laws that have no place on the statute book, and on stripping away the excessive regulation that stops businesses from innovating.
> 
> ""We don't think every problem can be fixed by passing a new law. We understand that Whitehall doesn't have all of the answers, and doesn't have a monopoly on the best ideas.""

Users can post their ideas and comment on their favourites. Relevant departments will respond to the most popular workable ideas, and the Deputy Prime Minister will give regular updates.

### Action already underway

The Coalition is already taking action. Within weeks of coming into office, the Coalition scrapped Home Information Packs - pointless red tape that was hampering the housing market, scrapped the top down housing targets and meaningless regional spatial strategies and put an end to unwanted 'garden grabbing' putting the decision back in the hands of local people.

The cash will be used to guarantee the spending commitments made by the previous administration which depended upon underspending across Whitehall.

Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander confirmed today that four Government departments have agreed to reductions in unfunded spending commitments totalling £1.5billion.

They are: the Department for Education, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, Communities and Local Government and the Home Office.

£390million will be made available to build 4,500 social rented homes, over 3,000 homes for sale at affordable prices and 1,000 stalled by the recession - protecting over 8,000 construction jobs.

This is on top of the £170million already made available by the Coalition Government to build 4,000 new social homes.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1631891,The internet age will help end the town hall 'non-job',"Council job adverts should be syndicated across the internet, to save money, increase transparency and help reduce pointless posts, Eric Pickles, Local Government Secretary will say today.

It can cost £5,000 to £10,000 to place an advert in some national newspapers. Often classifieds are filled with job titles many people would struggle to understand and many more that appear superfluous to the key services local people look to their council to provide.

The new Government will be working with local government not only to put online information on spending, tenders and contracts over £500, but also to publish job vacancies online, in an open and standardised format, for anyone to use, re-publish and 'mash up' without charge. There will be no public sector monopoly - the jobs data can be used by anyone, from commercial recruitment, newspapers to pressure groups.

This will not end advertising in the media; local newspapers in particular will remain an important source to advertise jobs to those who may be 'digital excluded' and not have access to the internet. But over time, putting job adverts online will drive down advertising costs, make it easier to compare pay ranges within and across councils, and show local people where their council tax goes.

### Pickles to call time on non-jobs

Later this afternoon in a speech to the Local Government Association conference in Bournemouth, the Secretary of State will call time on so-called 'non-jobs' and urge greater vigilance over how every taxpayer pound is spent.

Eric Pickles will say to the Conference:

> ""Putting jobs online not only shows local people where their money is going. It will mean they can question whether those jobs are really needed at all.
> 
> ""What does an audience development officer do? Is a 'cheerleading development officer' what taxpayers want? How many transformation officers and business development directors does one council need?
> 
> ""One council was even advertising for someone to spin for their bins last week. I wonder whether their residents actually want a 'communications waste strategy officer.' Or whether they'd prefer a few more bin men.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1632132,Eric Pickles puts stop to flawed Regional Strategies,"Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles is today putting a swift end to Whitehall's grip on local planning policy by scrapping Regional Strategies and their centrally imposed building targets that failed to increase housebuilding.

![Image: Eric Pickles speaking from behind lectern at LGA General Assembly](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1634909.jpg)Regional targets intended to build 3 million homes nationally by 2020 were put in place by the previous Government despite fears that they would force councils to cut into the Greenbelt. However, the reality is that construction has slowed down so much the country is facing the lowest peacetime housebuilding rates since 1924.

A statement laid in parliament today will revoke Regional Strategies with immediate effect. Councils will now have the freedom to prepare their local plans without having to follow top-down targets from regional quangos and bureaucrats that prescribe exactly what, where and when to build.

Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""Communities will no longer have to endure the previous government's failed Soviet tractor style top-down planning targets - they were a terrible, expensive, time-consuming way to impose house building and worst of all threatened the destruction of the Green Belt.
>
>> ""Today I'm revoking regional plans with immediate effect - hammering another nail in the coffin of unwanted and an unaccountable regional bureaucracy.

> ""I promised to get rid of them and today I'm revoking regional plans with immediate effect - hammering another nail in the coffin of unwanted and an unaccountable regional bureaucracy. They were a national disaster that robbed local people of their democratic voice, alienating them and entrenching opposition against new development.
> 
> ""Regional Strategies built nothing but resentment - we want to build houses. So instead we will introduce powerful new incentives for local people so they support the construction of new homes in the right places and receive direct rewards from the proceeds of growth to improve their local area.""

### Hand power back

Mr Pickles also pledged that direct and substantial benefits for councils who support construction would be the centrepiece of this radical restoration of local power. The money will be used to help ensure more new homes are built for local people, and matched with more new jobs and investment.

From today, power will be handed back to councils and communities to make their own decisions on planning that can get the country building again. Communities will, once again, be able to solve local housing challenges in a way that makes sense for them. In return councils will be offered powerful new incentives that ensure they benefit from development they welcome.

### Put town halls back in charge of local affairs

In a keynote speech to the Local Government Association, Eric Pickles said:

> ""In the past fifty days instead of writing guidance, I've been shredding it. Instead of creating legislation, I've been dumping it. You've been a prisoner of regulation, chained to the radiator with red tape, for too long. I want to liberate you. Focus on what really matters. Making localism a way of life.""

Continuing, he added:

> ""I want to make something very clear. Localism means much more than a tug of war of political power between Whitehall and the Town Halls. It's a fundamental shake up of the balance of power in this country.  So power goes right back to the people who elected us.""

### Show me the money

Mr Pickles went on to say:

> ""That's what we need to do. Show the public the money. That's why we've been encouraging you to put your spending online. It's not for my benefit. It's so we get the information out there which will let the public make up its own mind. Like the Prime Minister has said, we need to 'rip off that cloak of secrecy and extend transparency as far and as wide as possible.' So that people no longer think government has something to hide.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1634943,Rebooting Whitehall: Accountability to the people not the Government machine,"The Prime Minister joined Eric Pickles at department HQ, Eland House, today as the Communities Secretary published an action plan to radically shift power from Whitehall to local councils and communities.

![Prime Minister addresses Communities and Local Government](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1635156.jpg)

In a speech to civil servants this morning the Prime Minister unveiled revolutionary reforms that will ""turn the Government on its head"" through fundamental Structural Reform Plans to make every department accountable to the public. He pledged to transform the way the country was run saying:

> ""We want to give people the power to improve our country and public services, through transparency, local democratic control, competition and choice.
> 
> ""It really is a total change in the way our country is run - from closed systems to open markets, from bureaucracy to democracy, from big government to Big Society, from politician power to people power.""

### Radical decentralisation programme will hand power to the public

Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark said in a speech today that the department's new 18 month programme will deliver radical decentralising and transparency reforms to make the Big Society part of every day life. 

Mr Clark believes too much power has been sucked out of communities into Westminster eroding trust in politics, and sapping responsibility and initiative with stifling bureaucracy. The plans will replace the old, top-down systems of targets and central mismanagement.

Already Ministers have begun to remove swathes of centralising and red tape policies including ending Regional Strategies and putting housing back into local hands, ending unwanted garden grabbing, abolishing Home Information Packs and a burdensome council inspection regime.

The new 45 point action plan will force the department to shift gear so its purpose will be putting localism into action instead of ruling by central diktats.

Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark said:

> ""We're busting open the established way of doing things. The department will now only work to empower people, not to keep Whitehall in power.
> 
> ""Councils are no longer going to be strangled by prescribed one-size-fits diktats on the one hand and smothered by regional bureaucracy on the other.
> 
> ""We won't be micromanaging, second guessing, and interfering in your affairs any more. We're going to put citizens and communities in control.""

Communities and Local Government was one of the first departments to publish its plans for implementing its radical decentralising and transparency reforms set out in the Coalition Agreement. Voters will measure the Government's performance against the key milestones and priorities set out in the plans.

The Communities and Local Government's Structural Reform Plan will set out the department's five priority actions for making localism and the Big Society part of everyday life by:

  * decentralising power as far as possible
  * meeting people's housing aspirations
  * putting communities in charge of planning
  * increasing accountability
  * letting people see how their money is being spent.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1637560,Keeping faith in the Big Society,"Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said that faith groups are making a vital contribution to national life, and are integral to creating the Big Society.

Speaking to a large audience at the annual meeting of the Inter Faith Network for the UK, he told delegates that inter faith activity and faith groups were inspiring people to contribute to public service and providing support to those in need.

Mr Stunell, said:

> ""Faith communities make a vital contribution to national life, guiding the moral outlook of many, inspiring great numbers of people to public service, providing succour to those in need. They are helping to bind together local communities and improve relations at a time when the siren call of extremism has never been louder.
> 
> ""Inter faith activity is more important than ever in our work towards the Big Society, so I want to push for more inter faith dialogue and action rather than individual faith groups delivering social projects.""

### For the greater good

He added:

> ""People of faith are at the heart of civic society in local communities, and have been for decades.
> 
> ""Of course there are many different approaches, but there is a shared goal: building understanding between people from different backgrounds - not just sitting round tables but working together for the common good and tackling shared problems - be it picking up litter or challenging the far right.
> 
> ""It is not about compromising our individual beliefs - indeed we often come to understand and appreciate our own faith more when we are called upon to explain it to one another. But it is about respect for the other, the recognition of shared values and shared needs, and the will to action.
> 
> ""Interfaith groups are part of what we want to see: people reaching out to each other across boundaries of religion to make life better for all.""

Along with hearing how the Service is helping prevent home fires by visiting peoples' homes and identifying risks, Mr Neill heard how firefighters routinely visit arson ""hotspots"" and working with the local council report items, such as dumped rubbish or broken street lighting, that can promote arson.

During the visit the Minister watched one of the regular exercises the firefighters practice in the station's yard that simulate a domestic fire.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1640879,Andrew Stunell puts faith in Big Society,"Communities Minister Andrew Stunell has set out the Government's vision of the place of inter faith dialogue within the development of the Big Society.

Addressing the Muslim Christian Local Leadership Conference at Lambeth Palace, the minister welcomed the shared commitment that the leaders of the two faiths are making to explore areas where they can work together locally on issues of shared concern and encourage practical partnerships between people of the two faiths.

### Bringing faiths together

Hosted by the Archbishop of Canterbury, the aim of the event was to bring together pairs of Christian and Muslim clergy from different parts of the country to discuss how relationships between their respective congregations can be improved.

Andrew Stunell said:

> ""Across the country, Christians and Muslims are making huge contributions to their communities in countless churches and mosques, charities and community groups. But, because they are often working towards similar goals, there is great potential for them to collaborate more.
> 
> ""That is what this conference is about - challenging ignorance and building effective, friendly working relationships, not only between clergy and imams but between their congregations. Inter faith activity is an important component of the Big Society we want to build, in which people work together for the common good and to tackle shared problems.""

The Christian Muslim Forum was set up in 2004 to improve understanding and friendship between Christians and Muslims and to build a shared public platform to strengthen people of the two faiths working together for the common good, in partnership with others. Some of the projects undertaken last year can be seen by following the link (top right).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1641267,Baroness Hanham maps the progress of Government transparency,"The national mapping agency is the pioneer in a new era of information transparency by Government, Communities Minister Baroness Hanham said today.

Three months after launching the OpenData initiative, Baroness Hanham said Ordnance Survey is leading the race to make public data freely available and accessible.

### Free information for all

Since April the Government's mapping agency has provided a range of geographical and mapping information for free, and developed innovative digital tools to help the public sector and businesses use the information.

On a visit to Ordnance Survey headquarters in Southampton, Lady Hanham saw first hand that OpenData is driving efficiency and boosting innovation and entrepreneurship. The free information has already been used to map the famous Elephant Parade across London, and collect road routing information to help the emergency services.

Baroness Hanham said:

> ""Freeing up this public data has unleashed a wave of fresh thinking by the public sector and businesses. In just three months this new transparency by the Government has helped created a stream of fresh applications and websites that are combining free information and digital technology with the good ideas of ordinary people.
> 
> ""And this is just the start. We're changing the way Government works so more information is available to the public. We've already been working with local government to put information on spending, tenders and contracts over £500 online. Local authorities are also publishing job vacancies online for anyone to re-use and re-publish without charge.
> 
> ""More transparency will lead to greater accountability in Government. This will make it easier for local people and communities to get directly involved in issues that matter to them, and demand we work harder to meet their needs.""

### Boost for business, art, cycling...

Businesses are already using OpenData to boost their performance. Financial services companies have used the free geographic data to build ""fraud maps"" that reveal levels of fraud across the country. The maps are revolutionising the way these companies look at fraud because they show trends in different areas. Being able to see where fraud is going up or down helps with risk assessment and supply chain management as well as disaster and contingency planning.

OpenData has also had the domino affect of driving up the use of other free mapping services. The National Archives have started using OS OpenSpace to display a collection of 14,000 inter-war photos.

  * [UK history photo finder website](http://labs.nationalarchives.gov.uk/wordpress/index.php/2010/03/uk-history-photo-finder/) (external link)

And Halfords and The Great Tour of Britain have used OpenSpace to launch a unique 64-day cycling challenge circumnavigating the entire coastline of Great Britain. The free service has been used to plot the route for the riders who will raise cash for The Prostate Cancer Charity.

  * [The Great Tour of Britain website](http://www.thegreattour.org/route/) (external link)

In Cheshire OpenSpace is being used to run a road safety campaign which pulls together a wide range of information including accident hotspots to improve driving skills in the county.

""It weighs two stone"" he told the House, ""the document we've replaced it with is six pages and weighs an ounce.""

Regional plans and their centrally imposed building targets have now been scrapped. The Government said the top-down housebuilding targets had threatened the destruction of the Green Belt and had failed to increase housebuilding with much of the country facing the lowest peacetime housebuilding rates since 1924.

Councils now have the freedom to prepare their local plans without having to follow top-down targets from regional quangos and bureaucrats.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1642160,40 ideas a day to cut red tape,"In just five working days, the Communities Secretary's call for suggestions about cutting red tape has attracted more than 200 ideas.

![Image: Eric Pickles and Andrew Stunell meet front line workers in Boscombe](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/163394.jpg)A number of ideas have caught Communities Secretary, Eric Pickles' eye and he has written back to some of those individuals to thank them for taking the time to send them in. They include:

  * a Bournemouth resident, who told the Secretary of State, on his visit to Boscombe that there were hundreds of people who wanted to volunteer to help with the upkeep of parks but all the 'health and safety' forms and supervisory rules prevent communities from getting involved
  * in Fylde Coast, a resident wrote that the law that forces councils to advertise when they transfer public space ownership between county and parish councils wastes taxpayers' money
  * one of the ideas from Shropshire was that all of the rules for preparing local development plans should be consolidated into a single set of regulations
  * in Northampton, a resident suggested getting rid of central government targets because they are time consuming and about box ticking not improving services

Eric Pickles said:

> ""Too much power has been sucked out of communities into Whitehall eroding trust in politics, and sapping responsibility and initiative with stifling bureaucracy.
> 
> ""It is great to see frontline council workers making localism a reality by helping us cut back red tape, wresting control away from the bureaucrats and reversing the years of creeping state control.
> 
> ""In a week we've already had over 200 ideas from people who know what is getting in the way of them doing their frontline job. Keep them coming.""

### Have your say

On 7 July 2010 the Communities Secretary called on council staff and sector experts to submit their ideas. The Communities Secretary is keen to hear more ideas. If you have thought of something that will make work easier but have not told anyone yet or know of some CLG sponsored secondary legislation, statutory guidance or regulation that should be scrapped - then have your say by emailing: [cutredtape@communities.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:cutredtape@communities.gsi.gov.uk).

While we cannot guarantee that we will implement all suggestions they will all be considered.

The Minister will meet staff at a local community advice centre who advise residents on cutting energy consumption in their homes, schools and businesses.

He will also meet local council staff at the Civic Centre to hear their ideas for cutting back waste and making savings as part of a Government wide promise to ask people and the public sector for their ideas.

The Minister is keen to hear from frontline workers:

> ""Our coalition Government is committed to listening to what people want. Whether that's removing bureaucracy to get things done at a local level, giving more power to Councils, or getting better value for taxpayers' money.
> 
> ""We have inherited a record debt, and we are committed to tackling it in a fair and responsible way. So we are speaking to people around the country to hear their ideas about how best to save money in our public sector.
> 
> ""Frontline workers are perfectly placed to advise us on making backroom savings to protect the frontline services that people rely on.""

### Further information

The Government Spending Challenge website is open for everyone to submit their money saving ideas (see link, top right).

This is the first of Andrew Stunell MP's visits to local areas to hear from frontline workers. The next visit will be to Liverpool on 23 July 2010.

The Minister visited the local primary school, which this year had a pupil intake of less than 10. He saw the first efforts of budding architects and village planners as local schoolchildren showed him drawings of the dream houses they would want to see built in Essendon.

Mr Shapps was in the village to explain how, thanks to cutting red tape, a new right will allow people in rural villages to choose what is built in their area, helping to make sure that children who live there are protected against unwanted development in the future.

### A Community's Right to Build

The 'Community Right to Build' will allow local people and communities across England to decide where to create new homes, shops business and facilities where they want them and where they are needed, not where local councils and central government think they should be and free from unnecessary red tape and bureaucracy.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Far from the Nimbyism that often hits the headlines, up and down the country there are entire communities willing and eager to give the go-ahead for new developments in their area. The countryside must be a vibrant place to live, and cannot be allowed to become a museum. I want to give communities the power to preserve their villages, which are currently struggling to survive because of a shortage of affordable homes.""

Community Right to Build has the backing of celebrity builder and TV presenter Tommy Walsh. He said:

> ""I've worked with people on community projects for many years, and in that time I've found that no one knows the needs of the community better than the people who live there.
> 
> ""Whether it's building affordable housing to allow young people to remain in their village, housing for the elderly, new schools or even business developments to keep the community vibrant - if it's what the community wants, it should be made easier for them to do it. Any moves to cut red tape and help local people will certainly be welcomed by me.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1647409,Communities are ready for the Big Society,"Despite only a minority of people feeling that they can influence local decisions or taking part in volunteering over the past year, the majority of people are satisfied with where they live, according to a national survey.

Ministers believe this satisfaction in cohesive communities can be the bedrock on which to build the Big Society, by giving more power and responsibility to people and their communities. The plans will support local areas so they can take an active part in tackling local problems and contribute to decisions that affect them.

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""It's good news that the great majority of people get on well with each other and are satisfied with their local area. But levels of volunteering and civic participation could be higher. We want to see communities all over the country in which high numbers of people are actively engaged in making their neighbourhood better and are giving something back.
> 
> ""At the same time as we are showing people that we trust them to know what will work best in their local area, we are also greatly increasing transparency and openness in the processes of Parliament and Government.
> 
> ""Everyone has a part to play in building the Big Society. The Government's job is to make sure that individuals and community groups have the freedom and tools to enable them to get involved in civic and social action or to build on the good work they are already engaged in.""

The survey results, covering the year 2009-10, indicate a large majority of people think they live in a cohesive community, agreeing that their local area was a place where people from different backgrounds got on well together.

The survey asked 16,000 people for their views on civic engagement, volunteering, community cohesion and discrimination.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1652536,Greg Clark: Three actions needed to help the big society grow,"![Greg Clark speaking at the Policy Exchange](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1653653.jpg)In a major speech to the Policy Exchange, Greg Clark set out three key actions that will be fundamental to decentralising power and building the Big Society.

Mr Clark said that the UK has become one of the most centralised countries in the democratic world ""not just in respect of the balance of power between central and local government, but also in the disempowerment of the professions in the public sector; and in the way that voluntary organisations have been pushed out of the provision of public services.""

He said that decentralising power is what most unites the coalition and that for the ""first time in decades the most powerful forces in British politics are aligned in favour of decentralisation.""

> ""We need to turn central government upside down and inside-out.""

Already, Ministers have begun to remove swathes of the obvious centralising and red tape policies have put ""outrageous impositions on local freedom"", Mr Clark said, including ending Regional Strategies and putting housing back into local hands, making the health service more answerable to patients not politicians, allowing parents, teachers and charities to set up 'Free schools', abolishing Home Information Packs and a burdensome council inspection regime.

> ""We need to turn central government upside down and inside-out. Instead of the civil service only being focused upwards on providing advice to Ministers - and inwards on its own priorities - we must drive the focus downwards and outwards to put those resources at the service of communities nationwide.""

But the decentralisation of power and building the Big Society will depend on three further fundamental actions:

### Fundamental actions - a right to know

Firstly a 'right to know', as part of a new era of transparency and public accountability.

Mr Clark said:

> ""When public money is being spent, people should always be able to know how much is being spent and on what. This should apply to central government, local government and all public bodies that disburse public funds. Transparency is the foundation of accountability. It is also a powerful means of promoting efficiency, without requiring the heavy-handed intervention of an unaccountable bureaucracy.""

### Fundamental actions - a right to challenge

Secondly, 'the Right of Challenge' so consumers never again feel powerless to challenge the way public services are deployed.

Mr Clark said:

> ""The consumers - and potential producers - of public services should have the right to change the way that public resources are deployed wherever and whenever a better proposal can be found. Judgements on these proposals should be made at the most local level possible - thereby enabling communities to truly take control of their own development.
> 
> ""We should send a clear message to various public sector bureaucracies that their duty is to facilitate the decentralisation of power. Communities must stand before the bureaucracy as free agents demanding what is theirs, not as supplicants begging for scraps of freedom. That is why this government views self-determination as a right and not a privilege.""

### Fundamental actions - turning Government on its head

Thirdly, ""turning Government on its head""  so it works for communities, not just Ministers.

Mr Clark said ""The state should exist to serve civil society, not the other way round."" The department is already establishing a ""barrier-busting"" team whose sole purpose will be to help community groups get the backing they need when they encounter bureaucratic obstacles to local objectives.

Mr Clark said:

> ""If we want change to happen at the most local level, then we have to understand that at such a scale even the slightest bureaucratic hurdle looms large. Furthermore, it is very difficult for community institutions to get the help they need to get around these obstacles. That is why we need to turn central government upside down and inside-out. Instead of the civil service only being focused upwards on providing advice to Ministers - and inwards on its own priorities - we must drive the focus downwards and outwards to put those resources at the service of communities nationwide.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/16527871,Grant Shapps outlines local approach to delivering zero carbon homes from 2016,"Councils and developers could be given much more flexibility to meet ambitious eco-standards to ensure all new homes are zero carbon from 2016, Housing Minister Grant Shapps said today.

It comes as part of the Coalition Government's ambition for an eco-friendly economy and to become the greenest government ever.

The Minister has said he will look at ways builders could make payments to fund community energy projects, such as wind farms and district heating schemes, to meet their obligations to reduce carbon emissions from new homes - this could give developers and councils more freedom and flexibility to decide how to meet their zero-carbon obligations.

Minimum standards for energy efficiency measures such as cavity wall insulation will also be set through future revisions to building regulations. These will be based on those revisions outlined in a recent consultation on the Code for Sustainable Homes, which set key benchmarks for the sustainability of new homes.

Mr Shapps also confirmed the allocation of £600,000 to the Zero Carbon Hub to continue its work this year. The Hub has also been tasked with testing new benchmarks for carbon emission reductions.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""This is about meeting tough environmental standards, but not dictating how every home should be built. Councils and developers together are in the best position to decide how best to meet these standards, so we are looking at giving them the flexibility and a range of options to do this.
> 
> ""We are committed to all new homes being zero-carbon from 2016, and have the right mix of measures in place.
> 
> ""First and foremost a zero carbon home must use as little energy as possible, which is why I will shortly announce a minimum standard for key energy efficiency measures like loft and cavity wall insulation.
> 
> ""And to ensure the benchmark for carbon emission reductions is both ambitious and achievable, I look forward to seeing the results of tests the Zero Carbon Hub will conduct over the next few months.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1655017,Government ends regionalisation of fire services,"Forced regionalisation of Fire and Rescue Services has been halted as part of the Government's promise to abolish regional government and give stronger powers and responsibilities to communities and local services, Fire Minister Bob Neill has announced.

Speaking at an event bringing together Fire and Rescue Authorities from around the country, to help plan the future shape and role of the sector, the Minister said that Services will no longer have to work through Regional Management Boards, ending one of the last layers of regional bureaucracy.

This is the latest step in abolishing regional government and follows recently announced plans to scrap Regional Development Agencies and Regional Assemblies. The Government has also announced it is minded to abolish the nine Government Offices for the Regions.

Mr Neill said:

> ""We have fantastic Fire and Rescue Services in this country and it's time we stopped tying them up in red tape and give them more freedom to serve their communities. We rely on our fire services to keep us safe, not waste resources on bureaucracy.
> 
> ""Fire and Rescue Services are mature enough and professional enough to make their own decisions and to work together to make continuous improvements. I know the sector is keen to step up and show that they are more than capable of supporting their own.
> 
> ""The coalition Government is committed to stopping regional government and cutting away unnecessary layers of bureaucracy by placing power into the hands of communities.""

The Minister also announced that Government will no longer needlessly intervene where the National Framework is not strictly adhered to. Issues which will now also be left to local decisions include equality and diversity, and workforce development.

In recognition of Services' willingness to support each other, the Government will be ending its formal engagement with Cornwall Fire and Rescue Authority to help improve its services, following an Audit Commission assessment of the Authority as 'poor' in 2009.

The Chief Fire Officers Association and Local Government Association will help Cornwall FRA continue to improve and carry forward progress that is being made.

The Government will now only intervene in extreme cases and will instead work with the sector to look at alternative ways to support fire and rescue services.

### Facts

Government ending the regionalisation of fire services means:

  * Freedom for individual authorities to work on a collaborative basis in a way that works best locally and is not determined by regional boundaries.

Regional Management Boards, established in 2003, are made up of Fire and Rescue Authorities (FRAs) grouped together by their relevant Government Office region. By making the continuation of RMBs voluntary, the government is enabling FRAs to work together in ways which suit them and their local neighbours best.

  * Freedom for individual authorities around staff and assets.

The government will no longer expect to enforce recruitment, retention and progression targets or monitor compliance with the National Equality and Diversity Strategy. Similarly, the government will not be telling Services how to recruit or develop their staff.

Furthermore, the government will not be telling services how to manage their assets, such as buildings. Services will be trusted to manage their own estates.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1655326,"Eric Pickles lays the foundations for 1,600 new homes","Communities Secretary Eric Pickles visited Woolston, Southampton and laid the foundations for 1,600 new and affordable homes as part of a major redevelopment of the Quays.

The £500million Centenary Quay development is being built on the site of the former Vosper Thornycroft shipyard in Woolston. Alongside 1,600 new homes, of which more than 400 will be available to buy at an affordable price, the new site will also include a library, supermarket and a hotel, as well as bars and restaurants.  
   


> ""I am delighted to have laid the foundations for this exciting and extensive development on the Centenary Quay in Southampton.""

The project is expected to create more than 1,000 new jobs for the area.

Speaking at the site, Mr Pickles set out a comprehensive range of measures the Government has taken to get Britain building again.

The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government said:

> ""I am delighted to have laid the foundations for this exciting and extensive development on the Centenary Quay. The work started here will not only lead to more than 400 new affordable homes, it will also mean a new library, supermarket, bars and restaurants for Southampton residents.
> 
> ""But for every new development like this, there are communities across the country in desperate need of new and affordable housing in their area.
> 
> ""That's why even though we are making efforts to cut the record budget deficit we have confirmed £1.25billion to guarantee most of the unfunded spending commitments made by the previous administration.
> 
> ""This alone will protect over 8,000 jobs, and will mean work can start on 9,500 new social homes and 3,000 homes for sale at affordable prices.""

### Government measures to boost housebuilding

Housebuilding is currently at its lowest level than for any peacetime year since 1924. Since May, the Government has set out a range of measures to boost this. These include:

  * Scrapping regional housing targets, with plans to introduce new homes bonuses to encourage councils to approve new developments in their area
  * Securing £1.25billion of the previous administration's £1.5billion Housing Pledge, despite the lack of sustainable funding and a massive government budget deficit
  * Outlining plans for a new Right to Build, which will enable rural communities to set up local housing trusts and grant themselves planning permission for small numbers of new homes - subject to overwhelming public support expressed in a local referendum.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1656418,New steps to cut the cost of moving home and open up the books,"Home buyers can access more information about their new home without having to pay for the information, the Government announced.

The law is being changed to stop people being charged a £22 fee for a personal search of the Local Land Charges Register. This move is intended to make key environmental information more accessible to the public.

These land searches tell a home buyer about restrictions or issues that affect the property, such as planning conditions, conservation areas and protected trees.

The new Government has already suspended costly and bureaucratic Home Information Packs. Today's move will further help reduce costs for home buyers.

Making sure that this information can be accessed free of charge is part of the Government's wider drive for 'open data' to make public sector information more transparent and accessible to the public online. Local councils are in the forefront of this agenda to increase accountability and open up the books.

Housing Minister, Grant Shapps, said:

> ""Moving home is difficult and stressful, and the new Government wants to make it easier. We've already taken steps to scrap Home Information Packs, and now we are cutting the cost of researching the detail about your new home.
> 
> ""This shows in practice how freeing up public sector data and opening up the books can benefit the whole economy, by cutting transaction costs and increasing competition.""

Today's measures are being introduced to ensure compliance with European law which requires examination of environmental information on site to be free of charge.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1664105,Minister sees Big Society in action in Southampton,"Communities Minister Baroness Hanham was in Southampton to hear from local trainees how an innovative partnership of voluntary and private sector organisations is helping the local community back into work.

The Wheatsheaf trust works to promote social inclusion by providing employment advice and programmes to support people in finding work and training. The centre helps around 1750 people a year gain valuable skills and training.

Baroness Hanham said:

> ""The Wheatsheaf Trust is an excellent example of how the formation of local partnerships allows enterprise to steer priorities. I am pleased to see how the Trust supports those in the local community who are having difficulties with employment, by giving them the confidence and skills to look for and achieve a stable working future. This is a good example of the Big Society in action.""

The minister toured the centre, met staff and discovered how the trust addresses local employment and job training needs, through forming close working links with local employers.

Michael Oakley, 21, on Wheatsheaf's Future Jobs programme, talked to Baroness Hanham while attending the Finding and Getting a Job Course. He commented:

> ""I'm a qualified welder but there's no work around. I felt there was more opportunities for me if I trained. At the Wheatsheaf trust I enrolled on the construction skills workshop - part of it is a carpentry module. It has definitely helped me, I now know that carpentry is my future, and I will build on the basic carpentry skills I have already learnt here.""

Matthew Davis, 20, a trainee on Wheatsheaf's Future Jobs programme, was in the construction skills workshop when Baroness Hanham visited. He said:

> ""At the Wheatsheaf trust I have learnt basic construction industry skills brick-laying, carpentry and painting. This has built on my previous NVQ2 in carpentry and added to my skills. I am also more confident, as I have met more people. Through doing the course I have become more positive and plan to get a job in the construction industry so I can use my new skills.""

Elizabeth Fells, Head of Public Service Reform at the CBI, welcomed Baroness Hanham's visit, saying:

> ""The work done by A4e and the Wheatsheaf Trust is an excellent example of how the private and voluntary sector can work together to provide good quality services to the local community, on behalf of the local authority. Encouraging the development of more partnerships like this will be crucial to ensuring we can continue to provide the services people expect on a local level during this period of economic challenge.""

Jonathan Cheshire, Chief Executive, Wheatsheaf Trust added:

> ""We were very pleased to meet Baroness Hanham and show her our work. It was good to have the opportunity to show how the effectiveness of our work is amplified by productive partnerships with companies like A4E and public bodies like Southampton City Council.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1666181,Eric Pickles announces new measures to stop 'lobbying on the rates',"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has announced plans to increase transparency and stop the practice of local authorities hiring lobbyists.

A consultation will be launched to update the Local Authority Publicity Code, which guards against campaigning with public funds. It will include stronger guidance to stop tax payer money from being spent on private lobbying contractors to persuade the public or Government to take a particular view on specific policies.

Mr Pickles has already instructed all his department's quangos, including Ordnance Survey and the Tenants Services Authority, to cancel their contracts with lobbying firms. The Audit Commission's lobbying contract ended in February 2010.

Ministers believe that using taxpayers' funds on local government campaigns or to lobby government wastes public money as it gets used beyond the local area; public policy is weakened when conducted by private lobbying firms. They are private organisations not subject to Freedom of Information or transparency rules. The government will continue to conduct business with local government through existing direct channels.

Eric Pickles, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, said:

> ""Taxpayer-funded lobbying and propaganda on the rates weakens our democracy. So-called town hall newspapers are already closing down scrutiny from independent local papers. Now lobbyists are being used to sidestep transparency laws and shadowy figures are peddling more regulation and special favours.
> 
> ""Local activism and localism don't need lobbyists. If local politicians want to change the way government operates, their council should send a letter or pick up the phone. Councillors can campaign for change at a personal or party political level, rather than throwing away other people's council tax on the corrosive and wasteful practice of government lobbying government. Tough new rules will lower the cost of politics and increase transparency.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1666336,Free mapping data will plot route to innovation,"Local Government Minister Grant Shapps has hailed a new agreement between the Government and all public bodies that will allow them to use national mapping data for free.

The Public Sector Mapping Agreement (PSMA) will allow all parts of the public sector in England and Wales to access national mapping data and is expected to pave the way for a huge increase in new apps and websites that will improve public services.

### Improved services

This data will support a diverse range of services from the digital television switch over to reducing ambulance response times and improving school bus routes.

The new agreement will also allow councils to collaborate with private sector contractors and charities to deliver better, more innovative and more efficient local services.

Local Government Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""We're opening the door to a world of government information that will allow the good ideas of ordinary people to become innovative digital solutions that improve public services.
> 
> ""Easy access to high quality mapping data will trigger an eruption of new public sector mobile apps and digital mash ups that can quickly and cheaply improve local services, from refuse collections to protecting local birds and animals.
> 
> ""And this is just the start. We want ordinary people to come up with their own solutions to local problems that suit their needs. Across Government information is being made accessible and useful to as many people as possible in order to increase transparency and accountability. Individuals and communities will be able to get directly involved in issues that matter to them, and demand Government works harder to meet their needs.""

### Innovation success stories

The mapping data that will be made freely available has already been used to improve local services. An early innovator has been South Tyneside Council who created the 'My South Tyneside' web facility, enabling users to find schools libraries and other local facilities quickly and easily. The service also alerts users to local matters such as road works and local planning applications via email.

Cardiff City Council has also led the way by using Ordnance Survey data to improve free school bus services for local children, and in the process save money.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1672156,Eric Pickles - New era of transparency will bring about a revolution in town hall openness and accountability,"![Image: Spotlight on Spend website showing spending details for Windsor and Maidenhead Council](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1606993.jpg)Windsor and Maidenhead council is already putting spending data online

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles is urging all councils to publish details of all spending over £500 in full and online as part of wider action to bring about a revolution in town hall openness and accountability.

Following swiftly on from the publication earlier this week of spending and names, pay and titles of senior civil servants in Whitehall, attention is now being focused transparency in town halls.

The Secretary of State has said that transparency and openness must be the default setting for the way councils do their business and will call on local government to move at speed to adopt this new approach.

> ""We are calling time on this reckless attitude to spending taxpayers' cash on super salaries. Local government must wake up and realise the gravy train is on borrowed time."" - Eric Pickles

The letter sets outs proposals for a move to open local government. Councils are being encouraged to throw open their files and alongside spending info publish a wide range of data online including:

  * information on senior salaries, names and job descriptions
  * councillor allowances and expenses; minutes and papers of council meetings
  * job vacancies that will enable people to see why council wage bills are so high and how many of the positions are for key local services
  * frontline service data - including rubbish and recycling rates, council tax collection rates and detail of major planned projects
  * data such as food hygiene reports for food outlets - information which is routinely collected and of interest to residents, but not currently shared in an easily accessible format.

Greater transparency will root out wild overspending, expensive mistakes and waste and could be the key to saving the public purse millions of pounds. The expectation is that councils will see the benefits for residents and grasp this agenda.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""Getting council business out in the open will revolutionise local government. Local people should be able to hold politicians and public bodies to account over how their hard earned cash is being spent and decisions made on their behalf. They can only do that effectively if they have the information they need at their fingertips.  
   
""The public should be able to see where their money goes and what it delivers. The swift and simple changes we are calling for today will unleash an army of armchair auditors and quite rightly make those charged with doling out the pennies stop and think twice about whether they are getting value for money.  
   
""Throwing open the council books will open the door to new businesses and encourage greater innovation and entrepreneurship. Organisations that might have been effectively locked out before, including voluntary sector and small business, will be in a much stronger position to pitch for contracts and bring new ideas and solutions to the table.""

Baroness Eaton, Chairman of the Local Government Association said:

> ""Local government is absolutely committed to the highest standards of transparency. Councils have been leading the way in giving taxpayers real, detailed and vital information about how their money is spent. All public bodies must be scrutinised for the spending decisions they make, and the LGA will work with councils to pioneer an approach of openness and accountability.""

Mr Pickles added:

> ""We are calling time on this reckless attitude to spending taxpayers' cash on super salaries. Local government must wake up and realise the gravy train is on borrowed time.
> 
> ""The days of taking the taxpayer for a ride are over. We must deliver value for money and I believe our plans to throw open the books of councils will put an end to wasteful spending. There may well be a compelling case for this salary but so far it hasn't been made.""

A number of public sector bodies have already wholeheartedly embraced the transparency agenda. Please see the case studies attached below for full details.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1681360,More local homes means more rewards,"Local communities that build more local homes will be rewarded by getting more funding to use in their local area on things they consider to be a priority. Communities will be able to use their reward for going for growth on whatever they wish locally, such as council tax discounts for residents or facilities like playgrounds.

The New Homes Bonus, to be introduced early in the Spending Review period, will mean more homes built where they are needed and is intended to reverse the decline in the number of homes being built, currently languishing at its lowest peacetime level for 80 years.

The Minister confirmed that councils who take action now to give planning consent and support the construction of new homes where they are needed and wanted will receive direct and substantial benefit for their actions.

Mr Shapps urged councils to open up an honest and direct debate with the communities they serve about the benefits of building new homes in their area - how they can reap the benefits of development and not just the costs.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""We will not tell communities how or where they should grow. But the new Homes Bonus will ensure that those communities that go for growth reap the benefits of development, not just the costs.
> 
> ""With housebuilding at its lowest peacetime levels for over 80 years action is needed now to build the homes the country needs. That's why these new powerful incentives to build will be introduced early in the Spending Review period. And it's why I have confirmed that those councils who go for growth now will reap the rewards. So I urge councils to seize the moment and open up a debate with their communities now about the new homes they need and how they would use the new Bonus.""

The Government wants to hear the views of councils, communities and industry as it finalises the scheme. A consultation paper on the final scheme will be published following the spending review.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1682410,Cutting red tape to give a green light for greener development,"Developers will find it easier to make their building projects greener as Communities Secretary Eric Pickles announced government action to shorten and simplify environmental regulations.

Councils and businesses will benefit from a simpler system for assessing the impact of development on the local environment, and will avoid unnecessary repetition of work during the planning process for multi-stage projects, saving over £200m a year.

New proposals published for consultation today will revoke four sets of rules about Environmental Impact Assessments, and replace them with one streamlined and user-friendly set of regulations.

The complex guidance for carrying out assessments will also be scrapped and replaced so it is clear and concise, ensuring developers can easily measure and minimise any negative effects their projects will have on the environment.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""I want it to be as easy as possible for councils and businesses to reduce any negative impact new development may have on the environment. That's why we're scrapping this Byzantine collection of regulations and replacing them with one simple and concise set of guidelines for environmental assessments.
> 
> ""It is not enough for regulations to have good intentions - they also need to be user-friendly. So we've acted quickly to ensure the environment can be protected, without overwhelming everyone with red tape.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1683070,Grant Shapps scraps 'cosmetic' £5 million Town Hall surveys,"The Place Survey, one of the largest surveys in Europe carried out by local authorities, has been scrapped by Local Government Minister Grant Shapps to prevent cash being diverted from vital public services.

Introduced in 2008, the Place Survey is a postal survey conducted by every council in England. It involves asking questions of over half a million residents and is estimated to cost more than £5 million to run.

> ""These surveys are a cosmetic exercise which never change anything. Let's give real power back to the people - such as letting taxpayers veto high council tax rises.""

Results have been fed back to central Government and used to measure councils' performance on a range of centrally-imposed targets.

Fieldwork for this year's survey was due to take place by all councils between September and December this year - but the Minister has scrapped this.

Mr Shapps believes that the Place Survey was an example of wasteful municipal spending - which required council officials to ask residents a range of intrusive personal questions.

Local Government Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""These surveys are a cosmetic exercise which never change anything. Let's give real power back to the people - such as letting taxpayers veto high council tax rises.""

Scrapping the survey is part of concerted efforts by the new Government to release councils from Whitehall control - leaving them free to respond flexibly and effectively to the needs of their residents.

It follows the scrapping of Comprehensive Area Assessments by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles in June, instead making councils more accountable to residents rather than ministers in Whitehall.

The announcement also follows on from the new Government's plans to require councils to publish online their spending over £500; to stop Town Hall publications which compete with local newspapers; and to block the practice of councils and quangos hiring agencies to lobby Government.

All spending on goods and services over £500 has been put online. The information for 2009-10 details £314m of spending by the Department and £337m by Departmental quangos.

In a move that signals a new era in central government transparency taxpayers can how see how their money is being spent, what was purchased, for how much and from whom.

### Leading the charge for transparency

Communities and Local Government is leading the charge in establishing a new kind of government where the public have a right to know and a right to challenge. The publication of £500 spending data comes ahead of all councils doing so later this year.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""Greater openness in spending is the best way to root out waste, spot duplication and increase value for money. That is why I have been asking councils to 'show me the money' so local taxpayers can see where their hard earned cash is going.
> 
> ""Now it's our turn. I don't believe in one rule for councils and one for this Department. Central Government spends billions of tax pounds every year and transparency at this level of spending is just as important.
> 
> ""This Department, like the rest of Whitehall, needs to look at where every penny is going and getting this data out in the open will help that process.
> 
> ""The simple task of putting spending online will open the doors to an army of armchair auditors who will be able to see at a glance exactly where millions of pounds spent last year went. The public and the press can go through the books and hold Ministers to account for how taxpayers' money is being spent.
> 
> ""The data is already highlighting how we need to do things differently. That means spending more carefully, getting better deals and asking ourselves at every turn whether every purchase is needed and whether it provides value for the taxpayers' pound. Looking at last year's spending it is clear that there is room for improvement.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1685698,Homeowners at risk must seek early help,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has today issued a reminder to struggling homeowners to seek help early to have a better chance of staying in their homes.

His call came on the day new research from the Centre of Housing Policy at the University of York shows that the number of home owners who have given up their home due to financial difficulties has been much higher than solely shown by repossession statistics.

The research shows that whilst thousands have lost their home through voluntary or compulsory repossession, many more people have been forced into selling their home, before any court action is taken against them because of financial difficulties.

### CML repossession figures fall

The findings come as new figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) released today show that repossessions in the second quarter of 2010 were down by 400 compared to the previous quarter, and 20 per cent less than the same time in 2009.

CML have also today confirmed that they are revising down their original forecast for the number of households being repossessed in 2010 from 53,000 to 40,000.

Mr Pickles said that whilst the fall in the number of people losing their homes through official repossession action was welcome, the research demonstrated that many more homeowners had fallen victim to losing their home than is shown up in repossession statistics. He said that the findings strongly underlined the need for early action from homeowners to get help, take control of their finances and give themselves the best chance of avoiding losing their homes.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""Today's figures from CML are good news and an encouraging sign that fewer homeowners are facing the real and frightening prospect of repossession. But there is no room for complacency - struggling homeowners must take early advice to have the best chance of staying in their homes.
> 
> ""I am determined that those who need help are able to get it - and that includes the need to tackle the record budget deficit to avoid the need for rapid increases in interest rates.
> 
> ""Today's research lays bare the many hidden victims of the recent recession, homeowners who have given up and left home ownership, when getting practical advice before matters got too overwhelming might have kept them in their homes. That's why we are working with organisations like Shelter and Citizens Advice so people know where they can go to get a grip on their finances and can make informed decisions about their future.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1695375,Minister praises Dartford for binning fortnightly collections,"Local Government Minister Bob Neill has praised Dartford Council for listening to the public on keeping weekly bin collections alive on a visit to the area.

Mr Neill applauded the innovative public poll that showed 94.5 per cent of residents who took part wanted to keep weekly collections, and urged other councils to follow suit. Councils across the country have been moving to fortnightly collections over the past few years despite public support for weekly rounds.

Mr Neill today pledged that the Government will be legislating in November's Localism Bill to allow local residents to initiate local referendums.

> ""I hope other Councils will follow Dartford's example in the difficult times ahead as we work together to cut the deficit and listen to local people about what services matter the most.""

The Government is currently carrying out a comprehensive review of all waste policy from product package to waste collection. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has already withdrawn Audit Commission guidance encouraging councils to switch to fortnightly collections and laid out plans to remove the bin tax laws from the statute books.

Mr Neill met refuse collectors on their collection round in Joydens Wood and spoke to some of the residents who voted to keep weekly collections in the 'Big Bin Vote'.

Mr Neill said:

> ""The binman has never been so welcome as now with so many councils cutting weekly collections. Fortnightly collections cause problems with fly-tipping, odour and vermin as well as forcing people to drive to their local dump to get rid of their rubbish, increasing congestion and pollution from the traffic.
> 
> ""It's good to see here in Dartford the council listens to local people and keeps the weekly bin collections they value. It was fantastic to meet the refuse collectors who are doing such an important job as well and hear directly from residents.
> 
> ""I hope other Councils will follow Dartford's example in the difficult times ahead as we work together to cut the deficit and listen to local people about what services matter the most.""

The council received further praise for publicly ruling out the practice of 'bin snooping' - secretive bin searches to find out what the public are throwing away. Ministers believe the best way to encourage responsible waste disposal is to incentivise recycling rather than punish families with taxes, and reward them for going green.

Environment Ministers have axed the funding for 'pilot' schemes for the bin taxes. Under the bin tax laws, once a pilot scheme had been introduced, it could be rolled out across the country without a substantive vote in Parliament.

With council finances due to be tightened as the Government tackles reducing the deficit, Ministers are urging councils to increase their use of local referendums to find out what services people want to protect.

The coalition Government set out plans in its programme for Government to encourage the use of local referendums on any local issue.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1698504,Our streets shouldn't be an obstacle course,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has called for unnecessary signs, railings and bollards to be removed in a bid to make streets tidier and safer - saying ""We need to cut the clutter"".

Mr Pickles believes that many traffic signs and railings are put up in the mistaken belief that they are legally required. Although some signs are required by law, Government advice is that they are most effective when kept to a minimum.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""Our streets are losing their English character. We are being overrun by scruffy signs, bossy bollards, patchwork paving and railed off roads wasting taxpayers' money that could be better spent on fixing potholes or keeping council tax down. We need to 'cut the clutter'.
> 
> ""Too many overly cautious townhall officials are citing safety regulations as the reason for cluttering up our streets with an obstacle course when the truth is very little is dictated by law. Common sense tells us uncluttered streets have a fresher, freer authentic feel, which are safer and easier to maintain.""
> 
> **Key Facts**   
Decluttering Kensington & Chelsea's High Street saw a 40% reduction in road traffic accidents and a 60% reduction in pedestrian accidents.

### Councils urged to cut the clutter

Councils have been urged to get rid of unnecessary clutter in a bid to make streets tidier and less confusing for motorists and pedestrians.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles and Transport Secretary Philip Hammond are concerned that the character of the country's urban spaces is being damaged and have today written to councils leaders.

Philip Hammond said:

> ""We all know that some signs are necessary to make our roads safe and help traffic flow freely. But unnecessary street furniture is a waste of taxpayers' money and leaves our streets looking more like scrap yards than public spaces.
> 
> ""We have written to councils to remind them that it need not be this way - we don't need all this clutter confusing motorists, obstructing pedestrians and hindering those with disabilities who are trying to navigate our streets.""

### Big Society solution

Mr Pickles wants communities to tell councils about particularly bad examples of clutter as part of the Big Society in action. Organisations like Civic Voice, Living Streets and fixmystreet.com are already helping people alert councils to examples of clutter and showing people how to carry out street audits.

Mr Pickles added:

> ""Organisations like Civic Voice, Living Streets and fixmystreet can help councils provide a Big Society solution - local people carrying out street audits will bring power and character back to neighbourhoods.""

The Salisbury Civic Society concluded, after carrying out a survey of over 60 streets, that it has become cluttered over time markedly reducing its character. They found the city centre was littered with hundreds of bollards including one parking area for 53 cars had 63 bollards.

Tony Burton, Director of Civic Voice, said:

> ""Too many streets are plagued with pointless clutter, blighting the local environment and people's lives. With today's welcome backing from the Government we should reclaim our streets and see them cleared of clutter.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1700532,Eric Pickles praises Halton for joining the recycling reward trend,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has today praised Halton Borough Council, in Runcorn and Widnes, for being the first northern council to adopt recycling rewards.

Halton's voluntary recycling scheme, which started off as a pilot, lets residents earn points for recycling which can be spent in local shops and restaurants. Residents can earn up to £135 worth of points a year from over 120 reward partners, at no other cost to residents. Mr Pickles believes this is the right way to encourage households to recycle waste.

The Halton scheme, the first in the North of England, will now be extended to 47,000 residents. During the six-month trial period residents recycled 60 per cent more and collected a total of 6 million reward points. The council plan to extend it to a further 9,000 more residents in 2011.

> ""By adopting this common sense approach to recycling Halton council is leading the way proving that carrots really do work better than sticks.""

In June, Environment Ministers axed the funding for pilot schemes for 'bin taxes.' Bin tax schemes would have allowed local councils to charge residents for household rubbish collections or fine families for having a full bin. Ministers believe they promoted a culture of 'bin bullying' and fuelled fly-tipping to dodge fines. Under the scrapped bin tax laws, once introduced pilot schemes could be rolled out nationally without a substantive vote in Parliament.

In line with the Government's commitment to greener cleaner communities Mr Pickles has also withdrawn Audit Commission guidance encouraging councils to switch to fortnightly collections and laid out plans to remove the bin tax laws from the statute books.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""The first recycling reward scheme in the North of England is great news for all residents in Halton and good for the environment.
> 
> ""By adopting this common sense approach to recycling Halton council is leading the way proving that carrots really do work better than sticks.
> 
> ""The best way to encourage people to recycle is not to punish families, but to encourage and reward them for going green. It's time to rein in the bin bullies and work with local people to build greener and cleaner communities.""

Councillor Stef Nelson of Halton Borough Council said:

> ""The scheme brings benefits to the whole community in Halton. As well as providing rewards to residents, local businesses can benefit from increased custom which provides a welcome boost to the borough's economy. We believe this scheme is a win-win for all concerned and we are delighted to be able to offer the scheme to even more residents.""

Halton council is the second English council to go for a reward scheme. In June the Local Government and Environment Secretaries visited Windsor and Maidenhead the first council to adopt this pioneering approach to recycling.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1705785,Grant Shapps: HIPs failed because no one trusted them,"Home Information Packs were not trusted and it was right to scrap them, Housing Minister Grant Shapps has said.

HIPs were suspended by the new Government within days to provide certainty to the property market, and help it during the recovery by reducing the cost of selling a home.

### Lack of trust

Now independent research shows home buyers were 'very concerned' about the reliability of information they were receiving in HIPs.

The research by Ipsos Mori found that while over 90 per cent of people buying a house wanted information about its condition, fewer than one in six trusted this information when provided by the seller.

And more experienced buyers preferred to use an informal inspection by a builder, plumber or electrician who they already knew rather than use a condition survey.

Responding to the research, Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""It was always obvious that HIPs were deeply unpopular with people selling homes because they created needless cost and hassle. What is now clear is that people buying homes didn't rate them either.
> 
> ""People who buy and sell homes want to know more about their condition, but forcing them to swap bits of information they don't want or trust is a foolish way to try and improve the property market.""

### New voluntary system

Mr Shapps said in future it would be the housing sector that develops products that provide consumers with information about a home's condition.

This information will be exchanged between buyers and sellers on a strictly voluntary basis, and will ensure people buying homes only get the information they actually want, and that they know they can trust.

The end of HIPs has already seen a jump in the number of properties being put on the market, and will save consumers an estimated £870m over ten years.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1705883,Minister hails Bristol as the street party capital,"Communities Minister Andrew Stunell today hailed Bristol the street party capital of England as a host of community events are held throughout the city.

![](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1707675.jpg)Street party in Elton Road, Bristol

This weekend's street parties will bring the total held in Bristol this year to more than 120, involving over 10,000 people - more than in any year since 1977.

In the past, people trying to organise a small event may have encountered a host of obstacles, including high costs, a multitude of forms and guidelines. Last month Communities Secretary Eric Pickles made it much easier and there is now simple guidance and one straightforward form to fill in.

Mr Stunell said:

> ""The people of Bristol are clearly converts to the positive impact a street party can have on an area giving opportunities to collaborate and increasing the community spirit - not to mention how much fun they are.
> 
> ""Bristol has shown that it's a trailblazer in this area. But there's no reason other cities can't follow Bristol's lead. Street parties don't cost councils anything but can help create the strong communities that benefit everyone.
> 
> ""The guidance and simple form we're encouraging people to use makes it easier than ever for councils and organisers to make parties happen.""

### Pioneering

Streets Alive, a group that promotes street parties as a way of engaging with local communities, helped facilitate some of this weekend's events, though residents themselves coordinated and funded them.

Bristol City Council's pioneering efforts to make the process as simple as possible have paid off, with the number of street parties in the city growing each year.

Jon Rogers, Cabinet Member for Care and Health at Bristol City Council, said:

> ""Street parties are an important part of what makes Bristol great. We have cut back on red tape, kept costs down and do all we can to encourage communities to come together in a spirit of celebration. I am not surprised Bristol is leading the country.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1708493,Grant Shapps: Freedom for councils to manage rented housing,"New rules could cut as many as 8,500 applications from the planning system, freeing councils to focus on local priorities rather than micro managing rented housing.

New regulations laid by Housing Minister Grant Shapps means landlords will no longer have to submit a planning application to their council when wishing to rent a property to multiple unrelated tenants, unless councils know there is a high concentration of them already in the area.

Too many Houses of Multiple Occupations with short term tenants can turn a community into a seasonal 'ghost town', harming the local economy and increasing crime and anti social behaviour.

Mr Shapps argues that the current system may drive good landlords away from the rental sector, due to the current 'one size fits all' planning approach. The submission of a planning application to the council increases costs, slows the process down and limits the availability of homes and causes a drain on council resources.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Councils understand their local area best, and they don't need burdensome rules that assume housing issues in every town, village and hamlet are exactly the same. I am also committed to safeguard the supply of rented housing - shared homes are vital for people who want to live and work in towns and cities, and are important to the economy.
> 
> ""That's why I'm giving councils greater flexibility to manage shared homes in their local area. Where there are local issues with shared homes, councils will have all the tools they need to deal with the problem - but they will avoid getting bogged down in pointless applications, and landlords won't be put off renting shared homes where they are needed.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1710053,Time to get innovative Bob Neill urges councils,"Local Government Minister Bob Neill told Local Authorities thinking creatively will help them do more for less at a conference hosted by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA) today.

Mr Neill said frontline services could be protected as finances get tighter if councils start to rethink procurement, sharing services and being more transparent to get value for money.

The new Government is putting councils and communities back in control of their own destinies by pushing power away from the centre. With their new freedoms councils can be more innovative and radical than ever before about the way they deliver services.

Mr Neill highlighted councils that were already leading the way. Westminster and Hammersmith and Fulham Councils are planning to merge their education departments saving a total of £4 million. Already there are 11 shared chiefs in place and twenty other district councils are discussing whether to share their chief executive and senior management teams. Holland and Breckland district councils are poised to establish the first cross-county shared chief executive post between two authorities that do not share a border.

The Minister stressed councils must work with citizens to decide how to deliver services in a new era of transparency and openness. He pointed to Dartford Council where they held a public poll to decide on whether to keep the weekly rubbish collection. An overwhelming 94.5 per cent voted yes and so the Council developed a plan to share some services with Sevenoaks to cover the cost.

Bob Neill said:

> ""The most urgent issue facing the country is the need to reduce the deficit, put finances back on a stable footing and ensure economic recovery. To help cope we are transferring more power to councils that will mean more local decisions can be made with greater local flexibility. We are putting councils and communities back in control of their own destinies.
> 
> ""Many councils are already taking steps to make their own efficiencies through innovative and effective working. I want to see more sharing management, expertise and resources. Incremental changes won't be enough. Councils need to think about how they can radically reconfigure services. I don't for a minute believe that this will be automatically painless. But the sector recognises that there are savings to made to focus resources on the front line through better procurement, greater collaboration and sharing of services.
> 
> ""There is still waste to be driven out - greater transparency and accountability will help identify this potential. It is vital that we all look at where every penny is spent and that citizens are engaged in making these decisions. This is why we want all spending over £500 published online by January.
> 
> ""The Chancellor recently met with local government to discuss how we can increase productivity by reducing unnecessary waste and costs on things like reporting to Whitehall and the ring-fencing of grants. We are committed to a phasing out more ring-fenced budgets. We have already cut the centrally-imposed burdens on local government. The Spending Review will drive decentralisation across all areas that fund local government. Departments are considering issues beyond their traditional remits including those that cross administrative boundaries.
> 
> ""There will be real challenges as we face the future. But there are many things we can do to ensure that frontline services are protected, and that local people are able to hold local government to account. Localism will help local authorities to make the savings necessary to live within the fiscal constraints facing us all free from central government interference. Government's role is in the opening up of public services so they can be locally-driven services and meet local needs.""

Other innovative examples highlighted by the Minister:

  * Leicestershire and Melton are planning to share offices. West Oxfordshire and Cotswold District Councils have agreed to share a Chief Executive and other key posts. Their savings are expected to be around £330,000 a year. And plans for shared services are expected to save a further £390,000.

  * Councils in the North East are working to roll out their successful recruitment portal. It will deliver savings of £12.5 million by reducing the costs of recruitment - such as by through reduced advertising.

  * Councils in the North West are saving £1.2 million each through a joint tendering processes known as 'Chest' that lets them to access a wider range of competitive suppliers. To date over 16,000 businesses have registered nearly 60 per cent of which are small and medium enterprises (SMEs).

  * In London councils have saved over £11m using a 'care funding calculator' which makes sure social care services meet individual needs through transparent pricing.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1714388,Repossessions hit two-year low,"The number of home repossessions have hit a two-year low, according to new figures published today.

The Financial Services Authority report there were 9,978 repossessions between April and June this year - five per cent lower than the previous quarter and the lowest since the first quarter of 2008.

The number of new cases of households in arrears has also continued to fall - there were 37,200 new cases between April and June this year, eight per cent lower than the first three months of 2010 and 27 per cent lower than the same period in 2009.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""I am encouraged by the fall in repossessions reported today by the Financial Services Authority. But with nearly 10,000 homeowners losing their homes over the past three months, I would urge all those with mortgage worries to seek early advice and speak to their lenders, and would expect lenders to have exhausted every possible option to help their customers before seeking repossession.
> 
> ""Free help is available either online at [www.direct.gov.uk/mortgagehelp](http://www.direct.gov.uk/mortgagehelp) (external link), or from organisations like Shelter and Citizens Advice. And for anyone facing the real and frightening prospect of repossession, the Mortgage Rescue Scheme and Homeowners Mortgage Support Scheme remain available as a last resort.
> 
> ""But the most effective thing the Government can do for homeowners is to avoid the need for rapid increases in interest rates, which is why we are taking measures now to start tackling the record deficit.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1716044,Communities minister celebrates ethnic minority achievement,"Communities Minister Andrew Stunell yesterday celebrated the success of graduates in a pioneering scheme that helps people of all ethnic backgrounds achieve their potential.

He spoke at the graduation ceremony for participants in the First Steps and Black on Board programmes, both supported by Communities and Local Government, which offer training and support for people starting up social enterprises or looking to increase their influence in the local community.

Mr Stunell praised the scheme and outlined the Government's commitment to equalities and to building an 'opportunity society', in which barriers to social mobility are pulled down. The coalition agreement sets out a commitment to improve levels of enterprise in ethnic minority communities and offer internships to under­represented minorities in every Whitehall department.

Andrew Stunell said:

> ""Everyone, no matter what their background, should have the opportunity to rise as far as their talents will take them. This government wants to unlock the potential that's out there and enable people to succeed and to make a difference in their neighbourhoods.
> 
> ""All today's graduates are in their own way role models and will be powerful examples for young people from all ethnic communities and circumstances, as they encourage the next generation to aim high and demonstrate what can be achieved through talent, determination and commitment.
> 
> ""I congratulate all today's graduates and wish them every continued success.""

Black on Board provides training and mentoring for people from minority ethnic communities to help them achieve places on management boards in the housing, education and health sectors. The knowledge and skills that participants acquire enable them to get involved in improving their local area and play a more active part in the Big Society. Also run by Olmec, the First Steps scheme aims to boost ethnic minority involvement in starting up social enterprises - something the Government is keen to encourage as social enterprises and mutuals play an increasingly important role in service delivery in the coming years.

Today's event recognised the achievements of the 40 individuals, predominantly from minority ethnic backgrounds, who have completed these training programmes.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1727275,New rules for town hall papers,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles announced proposals to tighten up the publicity rules for councils so they guard against campaigning with public funds today.

In recent years there has been a major growth in the frequency and scope of council publicity techniques that use taxpayers' money whilst local papers have struggled in a saturated news environment.

Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, Eric Pickles, said:

> ""An independent local press is an essential part of our open democracy helping local people scrutinise and hold elected councillors to account.""

The new consultation proposes rules to stop municipal newspapers being published more than four times a year and to end the hiring of lobbying contractors. They also give more transparency and certainty to local authorities and political parties about conference stalls rules, for example, by distinguishing between the promotion of a local area for tourism purposes and the taxpayer-funded lobbying of politicians.

Mr Pickles added:

> ""The rules around council publicity have been too weak for too long allowing public money to be spent on frivolous town hall propaganda papers that have left many local newspapers looking over the abyss - weakening our free press - or to use 'hired-gun' lobbyists that operate in the shadows to bulldoze special interests through.
> 
> ""The proposals I am publishing today will close off these inappropriate practices and make sure that councils focus taxpayers' money on where it should be spent - protecting frontline services.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1730005,Experts join the call to get council spending data online,"Data experts across the country have echoed Eric Pickles' call to get local authorities' spending data online for the public to scrutinise.

Councils have until January publish details of all their spending over £500 in full, and the clock is ticking with just 64 days to get their house in order.

A number of councils are one step ahead with their data online already, but opendata experts are urging them to go one step further, think outside the box and consider how they can make the information more useful for the public.

Martha Lane Fox, UK Digital Champion, said:

> ""I welcome today's announcement that shows the government encouraging councils to publish their data online. Transparency, not just on spending but on all data across government, is essential in allowing people to engage with and challenge government. Today is a good step forward in opening up people's access to information, but data on its own is not enough. I'd like to see the digital community stepping forward to build applications to make that data tangible and useful for the public - and maybe even making something more enterprising out of it!
> 
> ""Councils should also see this as an opportunity to inspire more local people to get online and to show them that the internet can be a useful tool for them - whether that's inspecting their councillor's spend or accessing services and saving money themselves. All councils should sign up to the raceonline2012 campaign and make a pledge to help get everyone in their area online, not just their data.""

Jessica Crowe, Executive Director of the Centre for Public Scrutiny said:

> ""Transparency is a vital element of good governance and can help public bodies be accountable to the people they serve and whose money they spend. We urge local authorities to think creatively not just about the data they publish but how the public can use that information to hold them to account in a meaningful way and lead to better outcomes and value for money. We hope that other arms of government will follow CLG's example in promoting the principle of greater transparency across all public bodies.""

Professor Nigel Shadbolt of Southampton University, Chair of the Local Public Data Panel and a member of the Public Sector Transparency Board:

> ""The publication of all spends by Local Authorities over £500 is hugely important. Authorities spend millions and millions of pounds in our name, so why shouldn't we know how that money is spent?
> 
> ""It will be useful in a whole range of ways. We are going to be able to see what the pattern of spend is, what particular contractors are used and whether it represents value for money. Once it's published councils can have a discourse with the citizen to find out how they want their money to be spent and where they would want to save. This is another important step in the drive for open data and transparency at all levels and across all of Government.""

Chris Taggart, creator of openlylocal.com added:

> ""This is about a conversation with the people. Publishing information - which belongs to the public, after all - allows them to look at local spending and say 'wait a minute, you could be saving money there'.
> 
> ""There are all sorts of benefits to be gained from understanding the data and using the skills of the community to understand it. Councils themselves can benchmark their data and spending against other councils. People can build applications which will allow everyone to ask questions and join the conversation.""

Campbell Robb, Shelter Chief Executive, said:

> ""We welcome this news which we hope will be an important step in increasing transparency in how local authorities' housing budgets are being spent. What is now important is to ensure this is rolled out in a way which ensures consistency across the country.
> 
> ""We hope this announcement will be followed by a similar commitment to publish more detailed information on local housing issues, from rogue landlord convictions to success in tackling homelessness, so that local people can judge more effectively how their council is performing.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1735546,Grant Shapps to abolish century-old payment rules for parish councils,"Local Government Minister, Grant Shapps, has today unveiled plans to free England's 9,000 parish councils from archaic rules which prevent them from using modern banking methods and making fast and easy payments to the small businesses they employ.

Parish councils spend over £340million each year. But under laws introduced in 1894, even the smallest payments must be signed off by at two members of the council - creating a time-consuming process and leading them to use cheques instead of quick electronic transfers. In contrast, the Payments Council reports that cheque usage fell by £21.5billion in the last year alone.

So the Minister has confirmed that from 2011, parish councils will be given the freedom to use modern banking methods - in time for the abolition of cheques in eight years' time.  These changes are set to benefit the many private companies that parish councils employ, as they should now be paid faster.

The National Association of Local Councils and the Society of Local Council Clerks will now work together to put important safeguards in place so all payments made by parish councils are legitimate and there is no misuse of the system.

Local Government Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Parish Councils have been around for over a hundred years, but it doesn't mean they should be bound by outdated rules which make it harder for them to serve their local community.
> 
> ""It's time to bring Parish Councils into the 21st Century so they can get on and do their jobs in a faster and simpler way.
> 
> ""This is about removing the barriers so that local people can deliver the services that their communities care about, but it could also help hard pressed contractors who rely on quick payments to survive.""

The move has also been supported by the National Association of Local Councils, whose Chairman Councillor Michael Chater said:

> ""I am delighted that the Government is making it easier for local councils to get on and do their job through modernising the rules on the way they can make payments.
> 
> ""This much needed reform is very welcome and underlines the important role local councils play in their communities supporting local people and local businesses.
> 
> ""This initiative will give a much welcome boost to local councils to help them operate more efficiently and effectively and enable them to continue to play their role at the heart of localism and Big Society.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1746990,Eric Pickles - Council tax bills frozen in Spending Review,"Eric Pickles has said council tax bills will be frozen next year - as a result of a deal struck in the Spending Review.

With the Treasury agreeing to set aside an extra £650 million all councils will be able to freeze bills next year - meaning local taxpayers living in an average Band D home in England could save up to £70.

This honours the Coalition Agreement to freeze council tax and comes despite tough fiscal decisions being taken in the Spending Review.

Council tax has more than doubled since 1997 and Ministers believe that a freeze will offer real help to hard working families and those on fixed incomes such as pensioners.

Communities and Local Government Secretary of State, Eric Pickles, said:

> ""Hard working families and pensioners have seen their council tax bills more than double since 1997. But the new Government is standing up for hard-pressed local residents, providing special funding to help councils freeze their bills next year. Further financial freedoms announced for councils will mean they can better protect frontline services like rubbish collections and care for the elderly.
> 
> ""The new Government has already stopped the council tax revaluation which would have lead to higher council tax bills over this Parliament for many families. And we will give local residents a new power to veto excessive council tax rises in the future, to protect the interests of local communities and strengthen local democracy.""

Scotland has benefited from a council tax freeze for a number of years, without adversely affecting frontline services, and in this time the average bill in England has risen so that an equivalent Band D home now pays £290 a year more than that north of the border.

A new grant scheme will be open to all billing and major precepting authorities, including police and fire authorities, which decide to freeze or reduce their council tax next year. If they do, they will receive additional funding in 2011-12, equivalent to raising their 2010-11 council tax by 2.5 per cent.

The Spending Review also commits to providing authorities with additional funding in future years to 'lock in' the benefits of the one year freeze and help ensure council tax payers will not face subsequent excessive increases.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1764191,Big Society vanguard puts Whitehall on the spot to remove bureaucratic barriers,"The community coalition in the Eden Valley (Cumbria) Big Society 'vanguard' want to break down barriers and remove stifling regulation to change their local area - and have put civil servants on the spot in the process.

At an event in Eden Valley on Friday (5 November), nearly 150 people from community groups took control and put their case for progress directly to civil servants from government departments, who in turn want to break down the barriers in the way of progress.

Eden Valley relish their vanguard status and have proposed some ambitious plans for the area, including:

  * the installation of rural broadband, which could benefit over 60,000 residents
  * ensuring neighbourhood plans deliver more affordable housing
  * installing a hydro-electric generator on the Eden River
  * developing better public transport provision in rural areas
  * letting the community decide how council budgets are spent.

The Big Society is a revolution in terms of how the civil service are operating. Instead of only being focused upwards on providing advice to Ministers, Whitehall is now putting those resources at the service of communities nationwide.

Representatives from government departments (including DCLG, Defra and BIS) spoke about each project, and gave people and community groups direct advice on how to navigate the various terms, conditions, rules and regulations.

This direct support will also see departments completely removing barriers where they can, or making special concessions to see that community groups can do it for themselves.

Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark said:

> ""It's local people who have the energy and the best ideas that can transform communities, not us here in Whitehall. But for too long the stranglehold of bureaucracy has stopped citizens and communities from getting on and taking control.
> 
> ""We need to stand national government on its head. We are going to work with communities not by telling them what to do from London but by listening and supporting where we need to.
> 
> ""It's great to see these exciting ideas emerging in the vanguard areas that will help us to understand and resolve the bureaucratic hurdles that get in the way of locally driven social action, essential to building the Big Society.
> 
> ""As the vanguards are showing, there is no shortage of talented and passionate people out there who every day think 'I could do that better - and probably cheaper too'. I believe they are right and it's these local innovators who need a government that actively supports them in their endeavours.""

Over the past few months, four vanguard areas across the country have been given dedicated support from civil servants to nurture their Big Society project - turning them from ideas to reality.

Their job is to remove the bureaucracy and red tape that impedes community action. Many similar barriers have been identified, including:

  * accessing the right information

  * navigating around the various Whitehall contacts and agencies

  * cultural barriers and perception problems in Whitehall.

The three village communities in the Eden Valley want to deliver better value for money solutions to problems ranging from the need for cycle and footpaths to affordable housing to high speed broadband access for every home in the Eden Valley. They have been frustrated by the various tiers of government and its agencies 'at every turn'.

Progress to date includes:

  * Cumbria is now named as a pilot area for superfast broadband and BIS/DCLG are working alongside Broadband UK and other officials to support the community in participating in the next steps
  * DCLG/HCA officials have made significant progress in working closely with Eden Valley communities and enable them to identify the local housing they need be built
  * DCLG is brokering discussions with the community and the council over how we can give more power to the community over local budgets; and
  * Support is being provided to help with the take over of community assets (e.g. pub), development of local renewable generation and community transport schemes ideas.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1766069,Armchair auditors pore over council spending data,"Large numbers are hunting through council data as their local spending information goes online.

The Department's Local Government Expenditure web page, which links to all transparent councils has had well over 100 hits a day since it was launched in September. This is growing evidence that there is an 'army of armchair auditors' out there called into action by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles. According to preliminary stats the page has had over 7,000 views.

![](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1730360)Ninety councils across the country have now made their spending information over £500 available to the public. The rest have until January to act. Our Transparency map and timeline (see 'You may also be interested in' top right) show which parts of the country have opened their books and which are lagging behind. And with over 1,800 views, it's clear that progress is being carefully scrutinised.

Local Government Minister Bob Neill said:

> ""We want a new era of openness and transparency where all councils open their books to the scrutiny of the public gaze. This is not a box ticking exercise. The public have a right to see how their tax money is spent and make sure it's being spent on the right priorities. I applaud the 90 councils that have so far published their spending over £500 online and urge the others lagging behind to get their skates on. They have until January to catch up by which time I want our army of 'Armchair Auditors' to have local spending at their fingertips.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1768228,National Citizen Service pilots announced,"National Citizen Service will become a reality next year, providing young people with new experiences and skills to improve their confidence and help them make a difference in their communities.

Francis Maude, Minister for the Cabinet Office, has announced the locations and providers of the first National Citizen Service pilots, to take place in summer 2011.

The scheme, part funded by the Department of Communities and Local Government (DCLG), aims to help young people with the transition to adulthood and encourage them to get involved in improving their local area. In addition to a two-week residential component, participants will work together to develop social action projects in their own neighbourhoods.

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""Today's young people possess a huge amount of talent and energy but too often can feel disconnected from wider society. For many, National Citizen Service will be the first opportunity they have to leave their everyday surroundings, get out of their comfort zone and engage with people from different backgrounds.
> 
> ""The activities will equip participants with essential skills and allow them to develop as individuals. Not only that, but the whole of society be changed for the better by more confident, empowered and engaged young people.
> 
> ""This scheme is crucial for strengthening the foundations of the Big Society and I am fully committed to supporting it.""

Young people will be directly involved in the forward momentum of the programme, as feedback from participants in next year's pilots will inform the future development of the scheme and the nationwide roll-out.

Several of the chosen providers' proposals included strong partnership working with councils and other partners. The Government hopes that many other local authorities will be inspired to consider hosting a pilot in their area.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1771144,Kettering growth incentives benefit community,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps paid a visit to Kettering to see for himself how the new Homes Bonus Scheme will help a growing community, and how the incentives from the scheme could be used to benefit the town.

Under plans for the New Homes Bonus, which are now open to consultation, the Government will match the council tax raised from new homes for the first six years.  Communities will work together to decide how to spend the extra funding - whether council tax discounts for local residents, boosting frontline services like rubbish collection or providing new local facilities.

Kettering has bucked the trend of the recent downturn, experiencing growth and redevelopment at a time when the construction industry faced a tough test. And local people have proved very supportive of the new building work taking place.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""House building has slumped to the lowest level since 1924 in any peace time year. Under the old system it was top down, Ministers like me ordering what happened in places like Kettering and elsewhere around the country. It's just not working. What we want is a system that actually works. The New Homes Bonus is designed to give local people something in return when they say yes to developments in their areas.""

Getting the community involved has been a key strategy for Kettering Borough Council. Whilst preparing the local development plans for the town, councillors undertook a comprehensive consultation with the community, opening a shop to discuss the challenges and opportunities of new development in the town. As a result of those discussions, it was clear that local people wanted more local restaurants in their town centre, and a Market Place Restaurant project was brought forward.

With this wealth of experience already under their belts, councillors are now excited by the opportunities that the New Homes Bonus could bring to the area.

As Cllr Mark Dearing, portfolio holder for economic development and regeneration, said:

> ""The New Homes Bonus will provide a huge incentive for Kettering Borough Council in helping to bring to life the aspirations of our residents.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1774367,100 councils open their spending to public scrutiny,"This week South Ribble Borough Council has become the one hundredth local authority to put its spending data over £500 online for armchair auditors to scrutinise.

The milestone comes on the day Whitehall meets its own promise to publish the first of its spending data above £25,000 online. DCLG has already started publishing all its spending over £500 (see links right).

Greater transparency is at the heart of the Government's shared commitment, spearheaded by the Prime Minister to enable the public to hold politicians and public bodies to account. This ambition will also let the public, journalists and campaign groups put the data to use in meaningful ways - from rooting out waste to finding innovative ways of working.

Web developers and app designers have already taken up the challenge, transforming Government data on into ingenious mobile phone or home computer applications to help people move house, choose a school or care home or even find their nearest postbox - making everyday local life that little bit easier.

Minister for Communities and Local Government, Baroness Hanham CBE said:

> ""We are entering a new era of openness and transparency where all parts of Governmentare making information readily available to the public.
> 
> ""So it is great to see that one hundred councils have now put their spending over £500 online. With just six weeks till the New Year I urge those that have not done so, to catch up with their peers as soon as possible.
> 
> ""We are already seeing how useful public data can be in everyday life, from moving home to choosing schools. The public have a right to see what their tax money is doing.""

Here some of the best sites and apps out there for budding Armchair Auditors:

**Openly Local** collates everything you could want to know about your local council on a single page, from spending details and meeting documents to elected councillors to local demographics. [openlylocal.com](http://openlylocal.com/) (external link).

**UK Post Bo**x is a mobile phone application that helps the user locate their nearest post box displayed as red post boxes on a map. It uses a dataset of all the registered Royal Mail post boxes in the United Kingdom to plot their location. It also displays the last collection time so people can catch the last post! [data.gov.uk/apps/ukpostbox](http://data.gov.uk/apps/ukpostbox) (external link).

**Pick My House** Looking for somewhere to live? Just by browsing to where you're considering living and tagging (clicking) the spot in mind this site will give the user the low-down on the local area - local crime levels, schooling options, buses and more. [pick-my-house.com](http://pick-my-house.com/) (external link).

**ASBOrometer** This mobile phone app has become a national phenomenon, measuring levels of anti-social behaviour at your current location in England or Wales and shows key local statistics. It was made possible by the data.gov.uk initiative, which is opening up UK government data for public reuse. After achieving over 80,000 downloads in two days, ASBOrometer became the number 1 free app in the UK iTunes App Store. [www.asborometer.com](http://www.asborometer.com/) (external link).

**Best Care Homes** is a compare the market style search engine that helps the user find the right care home for a family member or client. Its database includes extracts from government inspection reports as well as information supplied by care homes, offering more detail than any other directory of care homes. The site also provides tools to help request more information about a residential care home or notify by email when new inspection reports are published on particular care homes. [www.bestcarehome.co.uk](http://www.bestcarehome.co.uk/) (external link).

**School Guru** helps parents find the best schools in Hertfordshire and enables them to see whether their child is eligible using official admission and outcome data from individual schools and Hertfordshire County Council. [www.schoolguruhertfordshire.co.uk](http://www.schoolguruhertfordshire.co.uk/) (external link).

The potential for many more of this sort of applications is growing as more Government and Local Authority data is being uploaded online every day. Councils have been asked to publish all their spending information over £500 online by January, which could lead to many more innovative web gadgets on all sorts of issues in the future.

Individuals, businesses, charities, community groups and other organisations are all eligible if they illustrate the Big Society in action. It's also an excellent opportunity for projects in the Big Society vanguard areas, currently working with DCLG to bust the bureaucratic barriers, to show how they are leading the way.

Over the past few months, the four vanguard areas across the country have been given dedicated support from civil servants to nurture their Big Society project - turning them from ideas to reality.

> ""There are some amazing projects and remarkable voluntary work going on in towns and cities up and down the country, by all kinds of organisations from large enterprises to tiny grassroots schemes and inspirational individuals.
> 
> ""These awards are a chance to pay tribute to those making a valuable contribution to their community, the real champions of the Big Society, but perhaps more importantly, I hope they will motivate many others to take action, get involved and drive change in their area.""

Minister for Decentralisation, Greg Clark added:

> ""There is no shortage of talented and passionate people out there who every day think 'I could do that better'. I believe they are right and it's these local innovators who need a government that actively supports them in their endeavours.

Individuals, businesses, charities, community groups and other organisations are all eligible if they illustrate the Big Society in action.

These might be:

  * people or groups who are bringing their community together and helping to give people more power to take decisions and shape their area;
  * people who are transforming our public services, staff setting up their own cooperatives, or new providers or frontline staff finding innovative ways to deliver better services to the public; or
  * people who are giving their time and money to help others, the unsung heroes changing lives in every neighbourhood of the country.

People will be able to submit nominations via a form on the Number 10 website (see link, top right). Nominees will then go through a selection process which will eventually involve a panel of previous winners and individuals from civil society organisations, government and the private sector.

Award winners will receive a certificate from the Prime Minister and will be invited to a regular Big Society Award Winners Reception at Downing Street.

The Awards kick of this week with the first winner, Central Surrey Health, a social enterprise providing community nursing and therapy services on behalf of NHS Surrey and other partners.

Further information can be seen on the Number 10 website (see link, top right).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1794133,Revolutionary new rights for communities will protect and transform local services,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has announced a package of powerful new rights for communities to challenge services and preserve local assets.

The new Community Rights measures are yet another leap towards localism and the decentralisation of power from Whitehall. The Localism Bill, due to be announced on Monday 13 December, will enshrine in law rights for community and voluntary groups to draw on when determining what happens in their local area.

They are:

  * **Community Right to Buy**. Local groups will have a legal right to nominate any vital community asset including local shops, pubs, libraries and leisure centres to be assessed for recording on a 'most wanted' list by the local council. If a listed asset goes on the open market, its sale will be delayed triggering a 'community countdown' that will give people time to prepare their business plan and raise the funds they need to bid.
  * **Community Right to Challenge**. Opening the door to a transformation in the way that local public services are run, Right to Challenge gives community or voluntary sector groups, as well as parish councils and council employees delivering the service, new powers to challenge and take over a local service. This could include running children's centres, social care services and even improving local transport links. Under the new law, councils must respond to this challenge and consider the positive impact the proposal could have on the community. If the proposal is turned down the council must publish the reasons for this. This new right puts voluntary and charity groups on the front foot when it comes to running public services and has the potential to open up new revenue for them.

Mr Pickles also announced new rights for communities to shape the development of the communities in which they live, through the creation of neighbourhood plans. The Localism Bill will radically reform the planning system so local people have a greater say and influence over what their home town will look like in the future.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, said:

> ""This powerful series of measures puts new rights in law for people to protect, improve and even run important frontline services. For too long people have been powerless to intervene as vital community resources disappear from their areas. The Community Rights measures will put control back where it belongs - with the people at the heart of our villages, towns and cities.
> 
> ""The Rights are also a massive opportunity for the community and voluntary sector to demonstrate their innovation and the new ideas they can bring to the table for better, cost effective services.""

Local facilities have been closing down all over the country, leaving towns and villages without vital amenities. Small community groups that are willing to take over local assets often find that they lack the time and resources to get a plan together and compete with the might and muscle of big business and developers, who can throw significant time and resource behind projects.

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell, said:

> ""These groundbreaking measures puts communities at the heart of decision making for protecting vital frontline services and puts them on the front foot for putting in an offer if they come up for closure.""

Tony Burton, Director of Civic Voice, said:

> ""Too many communities are losing the buildings and services that bind them together.  They need new safeguards to ensure community assets don't disappear for the lack of awareness of their value and to provide civic societies and other local groups with the time and capacity needed to develop viable proposals to save them.  Civic Voice welcomes the steps being taken in the Localism Bill to give communities new rights to help save the assets that matter to them.""

The 'one stop' shop concept, is a creative way to improve services to residents, whilst making the best use of shared buildings.

Baroness Hanham, Local Government Minister said:

> ""The inclusion of the blood testing service within the Centre, is a vital contribution to the concept of shared services. This is a facility which I am certain will be well used, and prevent patients from having to go to hospital, for this small, but essential procedure.
> 
> ""It was evident from my visit that the inclusive nature of the services within the building was being well supported and of relevance to the many people receiving help.
> 
> ""Kettering customer services 'one stop' shop, is a good example of what can be achieved, when councils and other public bodies look at creative ways of managing their assets. By bringing together services, so that residents who need to make use of them can do so in one place, makes these services more effective. Kettering is to be commended for its forward thinking in developing this centre.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1822578,Eric Pickles hears local ideas for economic revival,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles visited Birmingham to listen to local ideas from the business sector about stimulating and sustaining economic growth locally.

The Government sees businesses playing a vital role in kick-starting local economies and in helping to create areas that are vibrant and prosperous places to live.

One example of the Government's commitment to growth is through local enterprise partnerships - dynamic joint ventures between local authorities and business that puts them firmly back in charge of their local economies.

Ministers believe that by pushing power away from Whitehall, the Government is giving local democratic leaders and business the opportunity to decide how to grow their local area for themselves, and in doing so help rebalance the national economy.

As part of the visit Mr Pickles toured Cleone Foods Factory in Hockley, a great example of local economic success, which employs 50 people and sells its products all over the country. He also spoke to local business leaders who are leading a community project to help retailers be better corporate citizens at local level.

The meeting was also attended by the Birmingham and Solihull, and the Black Country local enterprise partnerships. The Government approved both partnerships last year. They are now gearing up to drive forward and deliver many of the local ideas for economic renewal that were discussed.

Eric Pickles, Communities Secretary said:

> ""Birmingham is a world city as important as Boston or Barcelona. Today, I have heard at first hand the ideas of local business who are already stepping up to the plate to foster local economic growth.
> 
> ""Prosperity in local business goes hand in hand with prosperity in local economies and the wider community. Through Local Enterprise Partnerships the people who have the knowledge about what is best for the area and how best to achieve local growth are being given the reins to rebalance growth from the ground up.""

In addition to this, the Government has unveiled plans to devolve even greater powers to the localities to drive economic growth in its plans to allow councils to keep the business rates they collect locally, giving councils renewed incentive to attract business to the area.

A £1.4bn Regional Growth Fund has been set up to support communities currently dependent on the public sector, helping them make the transition to private sector led prosperity.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1822675,Baroness Hanham visits Manchester regeneration projects,"Communities Minister Baroness Hanham opened a new wing on 20 January 2011 at the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester, which has benefited from £2m from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) to redevelop the building. This was matched by £2m from central government funds, and a number of private investors also contributed to the project.

At the Museum, Lady Hanham toured the new wing which is home to two new exhibitions, and met children from Oakfield Primary School at the new and interactive Experiment Science Gallery. She also spoke to volunteers at a Chinese Community Exhibition, which has one of the first community archives in the UK documenting Chinese history and stories of the first settlers.

Baroness Hanham followed this with a tour of two further local projects which have also benefited from the Fund. Manchester Metropolitan University supports students and graduates with entrepreneurial ideas, turning them into profit-making enterprises. Marketing firm Delineo have also benefited from a three year coaching initiative, the High Growth Programme, which supports budding entrepreneurs and businesses with their ideas to increase their turnover.

The European Regional Development Fund programme in England is supported by matched funding, including from central government, and contributes to hundreds of entrepreneurial, innovative and creative projects across the country, helping to shape communities and create jobs, tourism and local growth. 

Communities Minister, Baroness Hanham said:

> ""We are committed to creating real opportunities for businesses in Manchester. It is easy to see from the entrepreneurs and service users I met what a difference it makes to the individuals and the community. These projects are making great strides in helping the local community and opening up life changing opportunities.
> 
> ""This funding will contribute to the regeneration of Manchester by helping local businesses to realise their potential innovative ways. As the Government moves to cut the deficit, private sector growth is vital, particularly in the small and medium enterprise sectors and these businesses will play an important part in enriching their local area.""

David Malpass, Director of European Programme in the region said:

> ""I am delighted Baroness Hanham was able to join us today to see first hand how European money is improving the local economy across a number of important sectors. The north west of England has been allocated €755m from the Fund to spend between 2007 and 2013, with the aim to create strong local economies, creating a great place to invest, work, visit and live.""

![Image: Eric Pickles with Henry Grunwald QC, former head of the Board of Deputies](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1829196.jpg)Eric Pickles with Henry Grunwald QC, former head of the Board of Deputies.

Speaking at the event organised by the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust, the Secretary of State emphasised how important it is that everyone understands the relevance of the Holocaust to our lives today, and lit a candle to symbolise remembrance.

Mr Pickles also confirmed that Government support for local memorial activities will continue, with £1.5m funding over the next two years.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""Holocaust Memorial Day gives us an opportunity to find out more about what happened in Nazi Germany, Bosnia, Cambodia, Rwanda and Darfur; to look at why it happened; and to think about what we all need to do to make sure it never happens again. This day is relevant to all of us.
> 
> ""Antisemitism and other forms of bigotry have sadly not yet been relegated to the history books. It's the responsibility of every one of us to challenge divisive views and discrimination whenever we see them.
> 
> ""Holocaust Memorial Day is such an important focus for motivating people to do their bit to ensure that the horrendous crimes committed during the Holocaust are remembered and never repeated. This is why we have decided to continue to provide funding to support the crucial work of the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust.
> 
> ""Formal events are a chance to stop and remember the horrific genocides of this century. But the many local events taking place this week, in whatever form they take, provide even more important opportunities for the whole community to get involved. They rightly focus on education, young people, thought-provoking stories and active engagement with the modern day issues.""

The Government supports the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust to supply resources for teachers and for the organisers of the hundreds of local events that take place in communities.

The Trust is also encouraging people to visit their website and light a virtual candle to show their support (see link, top right). The site includes an array of free resources and information as well as details of events taking place in every region.

The remembrance event at the Royal Horticultural Halls in London brought together survivors, youth groups and human rights activists and provided a national focus for activity on the day.

Communities Ministers also attended the Holocaust Education Trust's reception and the Mayor's event at City Hall.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1830723,Final local government settlement a fair deal for communities,"Final arrangements for a fair and progressive funding settlement for councils that protect front-line services and shield the most vulnerable have been published by Local Government Minister Bob Neill.

Councils will only see an average 4.4 per cent reduction in revenue spending power and the grant has been adjusted so none will now face more than an 8.8 per cent fall.

This settlement reflects the desire to support areas with the most need and the urgent obligation to bring the country's public finances back in order, keep interest rates down and prevent the national debt escalating beyond £1.4 trillion of taxpayers' money.

Ministers have consulted widely with the Local Government Association, London Councils and many individual local authorities, listening to concerns raised. Having considered all views, Ministers have today confirmed the proposals for the distribution of formula grant for 2011-12 as announced in December.

Mr Neill said:

> ""We urgently need to reduce the country's public spending and local government accounts for around a quarter of all public expenditure so councils have a big part to play.
> 
> ""We have listened to views and looked hard at the figures and have pushed more money to those most dependent on grant so now no council will face a reduction of more than 8.8 per cent and shire districts will get £10 million to compensate for the loss of concessionary bus travel funding.
> 
> ""These extra steps once again show we have worked to deliver a fair and progressive approach that directs grant to where it is most needed - the vulnerable and needy - whilst protecting taxpayers.""

Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles added:

> ""This goes hand in hand with the new localism powers and spending freedoms we are handing councils so they can be as efficient and effective as possible with public funds, rooting out waste and focusing on frontline public services.""

The final settlement:

  * allocates a total Government Revenue Grant of £72.7 billion to Local Authorities in 2011-12
  * distributes £29.4 billion in formula grant in 2011-12 and £27.1 billion for 2012-13
  * keeps the average revenue spending power reduction for 2011-12 at only 4.4 per cent and reduces the upper limit from 8.9 per cent to 8.8 per cent
  * increases Transitional Grant to £96 million in 2011-12 and £21 million in 2012-13
  * makes a further £10 million available through Formula Grant to compensate Shire Districts for the loss of concessionary travel funding in 2011-12
  * ensures a fair distribution between different parts of the country - north and south, rural and urban, metropolitan and shire
  * creates four new grant bands or 'floors' with different limits that protect those most dependent on grant against potentially steeper reductions

The Coalition Government remains committed to protecting local taxpayers. A growing number of councils have already indicated that they will be taking up the Government offer to fund a council tax freeze in April through its £650 million fund. Authorities who do not increase their council tax are eligible for a grant worth 2.5 per cent of their council tax.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1833677,Top industry figures launch plans to free up self-builders,"Ministers have met with self build industry leaders to launch a powerful new group to advise them on how to cut the red tape and regulations that are stopping aspiring self-builders from realising their ambitions.

Since Grant Shapps called on the country's aspiring self-builders to make a housebuilding revolution their New Year's resolution last month, the National Self-Build Association has been working with his officials to set up the group whose task it will be to develop an action plan to tackle the key barriers to the growth of self-build housing - such as availability of land, finance and expert support for people new to the industry.

Today's meeting with Housing Minister Grant Shapps and Communities Minister Andrew Stunell will see the first meeting of the working group to begin to work through these issues, and agreeing concrete steps to try and increase the number of self-builds up and down the country.

Self-builders are already Britain's largest housebuilder, and account for about one-fifth of Britain's new homes each year, but for far too long the aspirations of ordinary people to build their own home have been thwarted by barriers and red tape.

These obstacles have led to the UK having one of the lowest proportions of new homes built by self-builders in Europe. The Government has pledged to end self-building as the preserve of the privileged few, and enable aspiring self-builders to put building their own home at the top of their New Year's resolutions.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""Self-builders already make a big contribution to new homes built in this country each year - yet we still lag behind most of Europe. I want to turn around the fortunes of self-builders by cutting the red tape and bureaucracy they often face.
> 
> ""That's why I'm delighted that the National Association of Self-Builders has agreed to work with my officials to identify the barriers that aspiring self-builders often face, and to let us in Whitehall know what we can do to make it easier to help people achieve their dream of building their own home.
> 
> ""I have been encouraged by the progress they are making in developing an all-important action plan, which will sit alongside the efforts we are already making through the Localism Bill to put power in the hands of communities up and down the country, enabling them to give the green light to new developments through the Community Right to Build, and simplifying the overly-bureaucratic planning system.""

Andrew Stunell said:

> ""Self build housing forms an important part of the Government's strong commitment to increasing supply of affordable and sustainable homes. Self build initiatives are both good for communities and the environment. They can help to regenerate abandoned urban sites, and ensure that countryside communities remain vibrant places to live and not museums.
> 
> ""And because of the value for money that can be achieved, self-builders can have more choice to include energy saving green products, such as solar panels or super-insulation. And by the very nature of being a self builder there are greater chances to look at new innovations which can save money in the long term.""

Ted Stevens, chair of the National Self-Build Association (NaSBA), said:

> ""Most people think building your own home is very expensive. They see many of the fancy homes featured on Grand Designs and think that's what it's all about. In fact the vast majority of self build homes cost less than £150,000 to construct - and for that you can comfortably build an attractive, energy-efficient, custom-designed three or four bedroom home.
> 
> ""We believe the actions taken by this new self build group could potentially make it much easier for people to build thousands of new, affordable homes each year. Our aim is to ensure that the new industry/government group will not be a 'talking shop'; instead we want to see it work as more of a 'launching platform' by removing the barriers over land availability and finance that are currently holding back the industry's development.""

The working group consists of:

  * Ted Stevens - chair of the National Self-build Association (NaSBA)
  * Jackson Moulding - Director of Ecomotive
  * Raymond Connor - CEO of Buildstore
  * Tom Willcocks - Policy and Strategy Manager at the Homes and Communities Agency
  * Stephen Hill - RICS member director of C20 futureplanners
  * Nic Bliss - chair of the Confederation of Co-operative Housing
  * Roger Humber - Strategic Policy Adviser to the House Builders Association
  * Paul Broadhead - Head of mortgage policy at the Building Societies Association
  * John Gillespie - National Development Director of the Community Self-build Agency
  * Barry Sutcliffe - Self-builder.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1836598,Have your say on new community rights to challenge and run local services,"Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark today opened a consultation on how revolutionary new rights for communities should work in practice.

The Community Right to Challenge and Community Right to Buy are two key elements of the Localism Bill, designed to hand power back to local people. They will enshrine in law the opportunity for community and voluntary groups to have a greater say over what happens in their local area.

Under the **Community Right to Buy**, local groups will have a legal right to nominate any vital community asset - including local shops, pubs, libraries and leisure centres - to be assessed for recording on a 'most wanted' list by the local council. The asset could then be listed for five years. In that time, the owner of a listed asset will have to tell the council if they intend to sell, which will trigger a window of opportunity or 'community countdown', giving people time to prepare their business plan and raise the funds they need to make a credible bid before it goes on the open market.

The **Community Right to Challenge** opens the door to a transformation in the way that local public services are run. It will give community or voluntary sector groups, as well as parish councils and council employees, new powers to challenge and take over a local service. This could include running children's centres, social care services and even improving local transport links. Under the new law, councils must respond to this challenge and consider the positive impact the proposal could have on the community. If the proposal is turned down the council must publish the reasons for this. This new right puts voluntary and charity groups on the front foot when it comes to running public services and has the potential to open up new revenue for them.

The consultations will run for 12 weeks from today, taking views from people, councils and their employees, community groups, voluntary organisations, private businesses and other interested parties.

The consultation documents can be viewed online here: [www.communities.gov.uk/consultations/](http://www.communities.gov.uk/corporate/publications/consultations/)

Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark said:

> ""It's vital that services respond to what local people really want, and give people the chance to do things their way.
> 
> ""Many voluntary and community groups have outstanding ideas about how they could deliver local services at high quality and reasonable cost, or run the local buildings and businesses that people care about in the best interests of the community.
> 
> ""We want to make it as easy as possible for them to put the new rights in the Localism Bill into practice - and we welcome thoughts on how.""

The Community Right to Buy consultation will consider a number of elements, including:

  * who should be able to nominate land or buildings for the 'most wanted list', and how
  * who should be able to trigger the 'community countdown' and whether community groups should be able to buy an asset during that period, before it goes on the open market
  * what type of land and buildings should be excluded from being put on the list.
  * how long the window of opportunity (or 'community countdown') for community groups should be

The Community Right to Challenge consultation will also consider a number of different options, including:

  * which services should not be subject to challenge
  * what information should be included in an expression of interest
  * how long a local authority has to consider an expression of interest
  * possible reasons for modifying or rejecting an expression of interest

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1842073,50 days to go to sign up to be a councillor,"With only 50 days left to put yourself forward as a councillor in this year's local elections Local Government Minister Grant Shapps has been joined by councillors past and present to urge more people to consider standing.

Mr Shapps said:

> ""With more powers being devolved from Whitehall to the Town Hall, now is a better time than ever before to stand for election. Through the Localism Bill, a key part of the Big Society, we are freeing councils to make decisions that will benefit their whole community, and come up with creative ways to improve their local area.""

The Localism Bill, currently before Parliament, will devolve unprecedented power to local communities. Its measures include a new General Power of Competence for councils and their councillors giving them the green light to be creative and act in the best interests of their communities. Rules that have restricted councillors from championing local issues will be scrapped and councils will be allowed to return to the Committee system meaning all councillors will have direct involvement in decision making.

Mr Shapps said that despite having been tied down by Whitehall red tape and local bureaucracy he is full of admiration for those existing councillors who have continued to champion their communities. But with these restrictions set to become a thing of the past he wants to see a new generation join this army of community champions. The Minister also hopes that this will see councillors become more representative of the communities they serve. According to the most recent survey only around 30 per cent of councillors are women, 3.4 per cent from ethnic minority backgrounds and the average age of councillors is almost 59.

Manjula Sood, a councillor in Leicester, said:

> ""Being a councillor is so rewarding. It allows one to make a real difference to the lives of others. It helps one to champion injustice and eradicate inefficiencies. Councillors are involved in all aspects of public service as well as community issues.""

Manjula implores anyone who has a passion to make a difference ""to become a councillor and leave a lasting legacy to the lives of others"".

Afzal Khan served Manchester, his ward and city, for 10 years. In his words ""this role has been both challenging and rewarding."" He also urges everybody with the time, energy and desire to help to improve their local area to get involved in politics, saying that ""you can make a difference but you have to be part of something to bring change"".

Fiona Thompson, a councillor from Welwyn Hatfield said:

> ""I always thought becoming a councillor was the sort of thing other people did. But the work is extremely rewarding and I really feel I'm making a difference in the community. I would encourage anyone in my position who cares about where they live to stand to be a councillor as it is vital to keep our communities alive. I welcome the changes that will be introduced when the Localism Bill is passed.""

People interested in putting themselves forward should consider whether a local political party best represents their views and speak to them about how to stand. Councils will also provide advice, and further details and contacts can be found at the Government supported website [www.beacouncillor.org.uk](http://www.beacouncillor.org.uk) (External link). Councils have varying dates from which people can apply to be a councillor but all applications must be received by 4 April 2011.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1847157,Grant Shapps asks communities to go for growth,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has announced almost £200m in the first wave of cash bonuses for communities that have decided to go for growth and build new homes through the New Homes Bonus scheme.

Explaining how the scheme will work Mr Shapps said the government will match the council tax raised from new homes for the first six years, which for an affordable home will mean an extra £350 per house each year. Grant Shapps confirmed that the bonus will also apply to any empty properties brought back into use.

### Bonus calculator

The amount of extra cash an area will receive can be easily seen using the New Homes Bonus Calculator, available under 'Related downloads' on the [New Homes Bonus](http://www.communities.gov.uk/housing/housingsupply/newhomesbonus/) page.

Selecting the 'Provisional allocations' option will lead to a page where each council can be selected from a drop down list.

People can now start talking to their council about how they would like to spend the money - whether council tax discounts for local residents, boosting frontline services like rubbish collection or providing local facilities like swimming pools and leisure centres.

The minister also said it will be up to the local communities and not Whitehall to decide how the building bonus is spent.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""We need to get the country building again - but not through a Whitehall knows best arrogance. To kick start a housebuilding revolution development needs to be backed by local communities rather than opposed by them. That's why we are introducing powerful new incentives giving communities a reason to say yes to new homes. Rather than feeling the strain of new homes through extra pressure on local services local residents will feel the direct benefit as they get to choose how the money is spent.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1848275,A new independent report shows value of handypersons,"Returning home from hospital after a fall, or facing the mountain of climbing a step when you are elderly can be daunting, but help through handypersons services can go a long way to reducing these worries.

A new independent report commissioned by the Department for Communities and Local Government shows that handypersons services around the country are showing that they are value for money and help elderly people to carry on living in their own homes with confidence.

Just one example is expressed in the words of one elderly Tranmere resident:

> ""I would like to thank you and the department for the service of your 'handyman'. The relief to be able to pull myself up the step to my door is beyond words. I am having so much pleasure from it that I felt the least I could do was return thanks.""

The report says handypersons services, can reduce the risk of injury or even death through preventing further falls, reducing risk of burglary or fire. These preventative services are cost effective, for example postponing entry into residential care can save up to £28,000 per year per person.

The handypersons services include:

  * odd jobs and small repairs such us putting up shelves or grab rails

  * falls and accident prevention checks and remedial action, for example installing hand rails at steps

  * moving beds and furniture

  * fire safety work such as the installation of smoke alarms, and electric blanket checks

  * home security improvements

  * gardening services

Many local authorities now have handyperson services kick-start funded from DCLG. Handypersons services generally support older people and people with disabilities. These services are often part of the arrangements made to enable people to be discharged from hospital to return to a safe home environment. Services are provided through in-house staff, housing associations, or independent providers including charities and individual traders.

DCLG has funded handyperson services from 2009 through direct grants to kick start services where they did not exist and build the capacity of others. From April 2011, handypersons funding will be rolled into unringfenced Formula Grant as part of the Government's decentralisation programme but local authorities were informed that the national allocation is £15.5m for 2011-12 and £13.5m for 2012-13.

Wirral Metropolitan Borough Council has been running its handyperson service since 2005 and works in partnership with the local Home Improvement Agency (HIA). Through joining up the handyperson service with occupational therapy, adult social care, the Home Improvement Agency and social landlords, they have succeeded in reducing the waiting list for major home adaptations by 12 months.

Now widowed, a Bromborough lady, was keen to thank Wirral's staff saying:

> ""I recently had a keycase fitted and thus I am now, no longer beholden to anyone else to hold keys on my behalf. This is very comforting.
> 
> ""From my first contact with a man who provided me with the correct number to the lady at the handyperson service who arranged it my personal thanks. George, who fitted it, was efficient and friendly and also notified the code number etc. to the right people, which was a big help. I wish to put on record my appreciation. Any organisation is only as good as its staff.""

Feedback from clients shows that their gardening service is also appreciated. A garden becoming increasingly overgrown can be a great worry and it also advertises that a vulnerable, often older, person lives there.

> ""On behalf of me and my husband, I would like to thank you for the excellent service provided by the handyperson. The handyperson is such a very special person, does such a good job in a friendly cheerful manner, nothing is too much trouble. Please give him my thanks"" says Mrs M of Bebington.

Wirral's gardening service has also helped a young person with Asperger's syndrome giving him work experience that greatly helped his confidence.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1848926,"£5m boost for Church to deliver stronger, more integrated communities","The Church Urban Fund has welcomed a boost of £5 million for an initiative that will bring people of different faiths together - to collaborate on projects to improve their neighbourhood and get to know each other better.

The three year programme, called Near Neighbours, will offer small grants to communities that have bright ideas for local inter faith projects. A wide range of community, education, environmental, arts, and sports activities will be eligible, as long as they encourage involvement by local people from different faiths or none.

Near Neighbours taps into the unique Church of England parish system which has presence in all neighbourhoods and an ethos as the national Church, with a responsibility towards all in the parish, as well as the Church's decades of experience in funding community projects in deprived areas.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""Religious organisations play an enormous pastoral role in our neighbourhoods and have excellent networks within our communities - none more so than the Church of England. They have been getting on with their work for centuries - offering support to youth groups, parents and pensioners and providing services to those in need.
> 
> ""Near Neighbours will build on this and bring folks from different backgrounds together for the good of the community - be it a sports event or working together to improve a local park, it will mean meeting your neighbours and getting on.
> 
> ""There are very few faith groups that don't look beyond their own faith and congregation to put something back into the community that surrounds them, so this project will build on that and I encourage people to get involved.""

The Department for Communities and Local Government has awarded the funding to the Church Urban Fund to strengthen and expand its inter faith and community development work and help break down barriers between groups of people. Near Neighbours will be set up as a charity by the Church Urban Fund and Church of England.

Church Urban Fund's chief executive Tim Bissett said:

> ""We welcome the government's recognition of the vital role churches and faith-based organisations play in local communities. More than 20 years experience has shown us local people often hold the key to solving local problems. Church Urban Fund is already working in these communities and will also use the Church's existing strong relationships and infrastructure to make this idea a reality.
> 
> ""We're also excited by the opportunities this grant presents for us to work alongside committed people from all faiths to bring about much-needed change in some of England's most diverse areas.""

Near Neighbours will start operating later in 2011 in locations in the M62 ""mill towns"" corridor, Leicester, East London and Birmingham, drawing on the resources of local churches long established in all the neighbourhoods in these areas.

The Church Urban Fund will deliver Near Neighbours in partnership with other bodies, such as the two below.

The Feast organises work in schools in the multi-religious Sparkhill and Aston areas of Birmingham, with the aim of developing better relationships between young people of Christian and Muslim faiths. Schools outreach workers build on initial encounter sessions with longer-term events that create a safe, trusting environment in which teenagers can share their faith experiences, gain a better understanding of each other's lives and develop friendships.

The Nehemiah Foundation provides training and mentoring for people and organisations seeking to develop their communities. Their 18-month full time Community Regeneration programme involves participants working with a host organisation while they learn how to assess community needs, developing business plans, carrying out an audit of previous work in the area and measuring its impact, organising local support, and building networks for effective communication. The Foundation has links with various local bodies, allowing it to tap into a wide range of areas of expertise. The Near Neighbours project will use the Foundation's expertise to train community organisers.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1849247,East London pupils outline their Olympic legacy plans for Stratford City,"Young people from three schools in East London have met with Communities Minister Bob Neill to share their views on the future regeneration of Stratford City and the Olympic park.

Mr Neill met with over 350 students aged 14 to 16, from three local schools in Waltham Forest, Tower Hamlets and Hackney who believe they have the ideas and skills to become regeneration ambassadors for their area.

The competition event was part of the 'Make it our Future' project, an Olympic Legacy youth project which aims to harness the energy and ideas of young people to leave a lasting legacy for their community. Students look at community, regeneration and local democracy to enable them to develop ideas for how the Olympic park could be used to benefit the community.

Mr Neill chaired the judging panel with each class of students presenting their aspirations and business plans for regenerating the area. United from Lammas Sports and Technology College, Waltham Forest came top of the schools, winning the competition. The judges felt their idea of a two day community festival celebrating cultures stood out from the other teams. The student ambassadors now have the task of sharing their findings with siblings, friends and the community.

Mr Neill said:

> ""It has been a really great opportunity to see the excitement and enthusiasm of young people in East London to get involved in the Olympics, not just as a sporting event but as a regeneration project and a legacy for prosperity and growth.
> 
> ""The ideas and appetite of the young people here to have their voices heard and be engaged in the regeneration of their area just goes to show how much people can bring to the development of their communities when given the opportunity.
> 
> ""It's local people who know their area best, not Whitehall, and it is their input that will transform paper plans, plots of land and piles of bricks into vibrant communities which people want to be part of.""

The event was organised by Citizenship foundation, in partnership with Olympic Park Legacy Company (OPLC) and Westfield Stratford City, who look to encourage young people to discover more about potential regeneration in their neighbourhood and engage with the plans for the future of Stratford City.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1851612,Grant Shapps: New homes bonus could offer lifeline to local youth projects,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps said new cash payments for communities who go for growth could offer a lifeline to local areas campaigning for more facilities for young people, and give teenagers across the country something to do during the holidays.

![](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1851588)The New homes bonus could mean more money for youth projects.

### Cash for campaigners

Mr Shapps said that thanks to a new Government scheme where communities receive cash payments to spend as they see fit in return for giving the green light to housing development, local youth projects may also get the go ahead or existing facilities improved. In a boost for local campaigners he said this could be spent on new playgrounds, refurbished swimming pools or five a side football pitches if that is what the local community wants.

The Minister said that from Wanstead to Watton communities are calling out for new facilities for young people - but despite tight public finances a new five a side pitch doesn't need to be a football fantasy thanks to the New Homes Bonus. Mr Shapps called on youth campaigners across the country to contact their Town Hall to see what plans their council has to use this new Government cash.

### Reducing anti social behaviour

Mr Shapps believes this extra cash can also play an important part in reducing anti-social behaviour caused by teenagers having nothing to do or nowhere to go during school holidays, and urged councils to consult local residents on how this money could be used to tackle this problem.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""Up and down the country teenagers are calling out for more fun things to do and places to go to meet their friends. But with public finances so tight many communities have given up hope on the prospect of new facilities.
> 
> ""But thanks to a new Government scheme where communities receive cash payments in return for building new homes many of these projects have a much needed lifeline. Communities themselves get to decide how this money is spent so if a lack of facilities for teenagers is a major problem then a playground or five a side football pitch could get the green light. Thanks to the New Homes Bonus a new five a side pitch doesn't need to be a football fantasy if it's what the community needs and wants.
> 
> ""So I urge all local campaigners to get in touch with their council to explore what plans they have to use the proceeds of growth to meet local needs and whether it can be used to get some of these projects off the ground.""

### Campaigns

There are hundreds of campaigns around the country for new or improved facilities for young people. As communities get to decide how to spend cash from the New Homes Bonus this scheme could help some of them get off the ground. Examples of campaigns include;

  * **Exeter, Devon**: Amateur football players faced losing five pitches at local playing fields run by Exeter City Council. Parents, clubs, coaches, Devon FA and Exeter City Football Club joined a campaign run by the local newspaper to keep the pitches open and more than 1,500 people signed a petition in support of the facilities. Local clubs have now been giving permission to take over responsibility for running the pitches - in future, they will be able ask the council that cash from the New Homes Bonus is used to keep the pitches open and make improvements, for the benefit of the local community.
  * **Darlington, Durham County Council**: A campaign is underway to get community support to raise up to £40,000 to install an all-weather pitch at Firthmoor Community Centre. It would replace the original tarmac surface which was put in when the multi-use games area was opened in 2007. Martin Landers, Development Manager at the centre. ""This pitch is now out of date and interest has dwindled with a football league recently folding. A new surface is urgently needed to get us up and running again as a much needed facility for the area. It would have huge health benefits, help reduce anti -social behaviour and raise money for the young people of Firthmoor""
  * **Jarvis Brook, East Sussex**: plans are currently being drawn up of what a new park could look like with residents then able to decide which plan they prefer. The ideas include:  
- An enclosed playground for young children  
- Seating and picnic benches, and  
- Fresh landscaping and community notice boards  
- A skate ramp, youth shelter and games area for football and basketball for young people  
Deirdre Harris, chairman of Jarvis Brook Residents Association, explained why the revamp was needed. ""It is very run down. The play equipment is about 25 years old and a lot of it is broken and unsuitable. So we want to encourage everyone to go there, right from the babies in the enclosed playground to the teenagers with a youth shelter, skate ramp and games area. It will have two ends - one where the houses back on to it for the little kids and the youth area by the car park.""

Through the New Homes Bonus Government will match the council tax raised from new homes for the first six years. Empty properties brought back into use will also receive a cash bonus and an extra £350 per house premium will be paid for affordable homes. This works out at £9,000 paid on average to each Band D home or almost £11,000 for an equivalent affordable home.

So if an area increased the number of homes by 1,000 units this could earn the community £10 million to spend as they see fit - whether on skate parks or other facilities for young people, council tax discounts or boosting frontline services such as rubbish collection.

This will mean that for the first time rather than having development forced on them from Whitehall through centrally imposed targets there is a reason for communities to support growth. Through, for example a new skate park giving teenagers something to do and cutting down on anti-social behaviour, communities will be able to see the benefits of development in their area for themselves.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1854104,Government action securing council tax freeze for residents,"Today Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles praises 'can freeze' councils who are saying yes to the Government's offer to help keep local council tax payers' cost of living down at a critical time.

The nation faces an unprecedented financial situation and every part of the public sector, including local government, which accounts for a quarter of all public expenditure, has a part to play in cutting the deficit.

New figures show over three hundred and thirty councils in England have so far indicated that they will be taking up the Government offer to fund a council tax freeze in April through its £650m fund. This gives authorities who do not put up their council tax a grant worth 2.5 per cent of their council tax income. The freeze means local taxpayers living in an average Band D home in England could save up to £70.

Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""I welcome the news that almost every council has said it wants to take part in the Government's £650 million council tax freeze initiative.
> 
> ""This shows that local authorities can freeze council tax for residents helping them manage their monthly outgoings whilst working hard to protect frontline services. Tackling the nation's deficit is the Governments biggest priority but we have made this money available to help hard working families and pensioners tired of seeing their council tax bill go up.""

A fair and progressive funding settlement for councils that protects front-line services and shields the most vulnerable communities with significant social challenges was confirmed last month. For example, residents in Hackney will receive £1,043 per head and those in Wokingham will receive £125 per head.

£29.4bn of council grant has been fairly distributed between different parts of the country - north and south, rural and urban, metropolitan and shire. As a result councils will only see an average 4.4 per cent reduction in revenue spending power and none will now face more than an 8.8 per cent fall.

Local authorities have already been given full control over £7bn of funding, all non-schools ring fenced grants have been removed, councils and the NHS are being brought closer together and the bureaucratic burdens associated with inspection and targets have been removed.

Stopping a 5 per cent council tax rise (the capping threshold in recent years) would therefore save £71 in 2011-12. Should an average 2.5 per cent rise have occurred the saving would have been £35.

Baroness Hanham visited Berwick Workspace, a business start up initiative which is helping to create new jobs and assist 37 small businesses in providing bespoke training, mentoring and developing effective links with relevant industry.

To mark the 100th anniversary of International Women's day, Baroness Hanham also joined three successful local entrepreneurs, in celebrating women's achievements past, present and future.

The Minister also officially announced £2.5 million European Regional Development funding when she opened the National Renewable Energy Centre in Blyth, which will place the Northumberland at the centre of Offshore Wind Turbine developments.

Through these projects, the Northumberland local economy has benefited from over £12 million European Regional Development funding, with additional support provided by Berwick and Northumberland councils, One North East, and Northumberland Strategic Partnership.

Baroness Hanham said:

> ""We believe that local communities know what's best for driving economic growth in their area and it was inspiring to hear from entrepreneurs in Northumberland how they are using Government funding to create new business and jobs. These projects are opening up life changing opportunities for the local community and will contribute to the regeneration of Northumberland by helping local businesses to realise their potential.
> 
> ""As the Government continues to cut the deficit, private sector growth is vital, particularly in the small and medium enterprise sectors, these businesses will play an important part in enriching their local area.
> 
> ""It was a honour to mark International Women's day in Northumberland and celebrate the achievements of local businesswomen who are playing such a key role in reviving their local economy.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1861489,Frozen council tax will help with cost of living,"Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles welcomes the news today that councils have taken up the Government's council tax freeze offer helping to keep this part of residents cost of living down at a critical time.

An independent survey published by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA) today has confirmed that council tax bills are to be frozen across England this year, thanks to the Government's council tax freeze initiative.

The Chartered Institure of Public Finance and Accountancy's survey estimates there will actually be a slight reduction of 35 pence on last year's council tax level. The average Band D English council tax bill will be £1,438.87.

The Government's own monitoring shows 333 councils in England have so far indicated that they will be taking up the Government freeze offer. A list of the councils is available to download at the bottom of the following page: [http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1854104](http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1854104).

Eric Pickles, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, said:

> ""Council tax has doubled in the last decade. But the Government has frozen council tax, saving hard-working families and pensioners up to £72 this year. We have scrapped a council tax revaluation and we want to give local residents new rights to veto excessive council tax rises in the future. This is real help now to assist with the cost of living.""

In the October Spending Review the Government confirmed that it would fund a council tax freeze in 2011-12, by providing a £650 million a year fund for local authorities over the Spending Review period. This offered authorities who do not put up their council tax a grant equivalent to increasing their council tax by 2.5 per cent.

The capping threshold in recent years was a 5 per cent council tax rise. Stopping such a rise in 2011-12 would therefore save a typical household up to £72. Should an average 2.5 per cent rise have occurred the saving would have been £36.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1884893,'Backdoor' bin charging not allowed,"The Coalition Government is today reminding local councils not to exceed their legal powers by imposing 'backdoor' bin taxes.

In a joint letter to all councils, Environment Minister Lord Henley and Local Government Minister Bob Neill raise serious concerns that, through the Waste Review being carried out it has become clear that a small minority of councils are seeking to charge for bin bags or for the collection of normal household rubbish. Councils were accordingly reminded of the law and instructed to stop the spread of such practice.

The letter states: ""councils cannot introduce 'backdoor' bin charging for mainstream waste collections or waste disposal. Such stealth taxes are not legal and are contrary to the policy direction of the new Government.""

Section 45 (3) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 specifically bars local authorities from making a charge for the collection of household waste, except in cases prescribed in regulations.

The Localism Bill is ending the legislation which allowed for the introduction and roll-out of new taxes for the collection of household bins. The new Government has also cancelled the pilot schemes for these new bin taxes.

Eric Pickles, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government said:

> ""We are stopping municipal officials from levying unfair backdoor bin taxes. Families pay £120 a month in council tax - they deserve a comprehensive and frequent bin collection service in return without bin bag charges on top. Bin charging harms the environment by rewarding fly-tipping and backyard burning.""

Caroline Spelman, Secretary of State for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs added:

> ""We want it to make it as easy as possible for people to do the right thing and dispose of their waste responsibly. Measures such as additional charging or petty officialdom simply make life difficult for hard-pressed families and pose additional threats to the environment from fly tipping and other socially irresponsible behaviour.""

Councils were also informed that as part of the Waste Review, due to report in May, the Government is reviewing the enforcement powers and penalties available to local authorities in relation to waste collection and disposal, to ensure that they are proportionate, relevant and respect civil liberties.

The review is looking at how it can work with local councils to increase the frequency and quality of rubbish collections and make it easier to recycle, to tackle measures which encourage councils specifically to cut the scope of collections; and to address public concerns over the civil liberty aspects of inappropriate enforcement practices associated with household collections.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1889672,Localising audit - delivering value for money for the tax payer,"The firm FTI have today been appointed to provide advice on the most cost effective options for disbanding the Audit Commission and transferring audit into the private sector.

In August last year the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government announced plans to disband the Audit Commission and refocus audit on helping local people hold their councils and other public bodies to account for local spending decisions.

The Government is taking forward plans to transfer the audit function of the Audit Commission out of public ownership.

The changes to auditing will establish an audit market that offers greater competition and choice and it is anticipated that the reforms will save the taxpayer £50 million a year.

FTI have been appointed to provide professional, independent advice on the financial implications of the options for transferring the in-house audit practice to the private sector including the possibility of mutualisation.

FTI will bring commercial expertise to assess how best to achieve a good deal for the taxpayer that will maximise the value for money for the public purse.

A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said:

> ""We have set in train measures to radically scale back centrally imposed, bureaucratic and costly inspection and auditing, saving council taxpayers money.
> 
> ""Auditing provides the assurances and confidence that public money is being properly spent. But having an effective audit system is not dependant on it being part of the public sector. The audit function of the Commission will therefore be moved into the private sector. Bringing in commercial expertise to support this process is a sensible measure that will help us to secure value for money for the public purse.""

FTI's work will inform the wider decisions about how best to take forward, in the most effective way, the transfer of the in-house audit practice into the private sector.

FTI specialises in corporate finance and restructure. The consulting firm has been appointed on a four week contract following a competitive tender process. They will examine the implications associated with each of the main options for transferring the audit practice into the private sector advising on the value for money considerations and risk.

The minister visited a construction site for a new processing depot for the Crossrail project at the site of Lafarge's former cement works. The depot will store and transport nearly all the material excavated from Crossrail's western tunnel, creating 140 new jobs. Reinstating the old rail link on the site will also ease road congestion from transporting excavation waste.

He also saw their plans to turn the site into 500 new homes after the Crossrail project is complete. The office, retail and industrial space to be built alongside it is set to create over 1,500 jobs.

The minister went on to meet Theresa Durrant, an entrepreneur who is setting up her new business, Resource On Demand Limited, at the newly completed state of the art business centre within minutes of Dartford Station.

Theresa's recruitment company is one of the first of around 75 businesses planned for 'The Base' which offers high quality office, studio and workshop facilities with excellent eco-friendly standards, with low CO2 emmissions and water. Already a quarter of its facilities are reserved. It was funded by nearly £7 million from the Homes and Communities Agency.

Bob Neill said:

> ""It's clear from what I've seen today that the Thames Gateway continues to grow and deliver for local people and businesses, and both the public and the private sectors are working hard to create the conditions for economic growth.
> 
> ""The innovative redevelopment of Lafarge's cement works will play an important role in supporting the delivery of Crossrail, and is a great example of how an old industrial site can be transformed into exciting new opportunities, creating hundreds of much needed new homes and jobs. And with the promise of 75 new businesses moving into The Base in Dartford, I believe the Thames Gateway is well and truly open for business.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1952235,Communities interns tell Nick Clegg their ideas for the future,"The importance of the youth voice in shaping future communities was emphasised after young interns working at the Department presented their inspiring and creative ideas to the Deputy Prime Minister.

In a meeting attended by Communities ministers Greg Clark and Andrew Stunell, Aisha Bi, from the British Youth Council, highlighted the work of her and her fellow interns in the Department to engage more young people in their local communities.

Since January three young interns, Aisha Bi, Catriona Duncan and Fahim Ahmed have been working with officials and Ministers in the Department and offering their unique insight on the development of policy. The interns are on placement within the Department through the British Youth Council which works to empower young people across the country to have their say.

Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark said:

> ""Working with the interns has been illuminating and their determined approach is an inspiration to other young people.
> 
> ""Across the country thousands of young people are raring to have their voices heard and get more involved in the development of their communities.
> 
> ""It makes sense that Government, rather than constraining young people, listens to their expertise and unique insight, empowering them to ensure that local services suit the needs of their local communities.""

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""We believe in driving power down to communities, the people are the boss and they are best placed to decide what is needed in their local area. Rather than telling young people what to do and how to do it we are asking them what stands in their way and helping them to do something about it.
> 
> ""The impressive achievements of the young interns in the Department are further proof that young people have the ambition, enthusiasm and ideas to make a positive difference to their communities when given the opportunity.""

Aisha Bi said:

> ""If you listen out young people have a lot of really great ideas about involving their friends and changing their communities. I am proud of my work at the Department and I genuinely feel that as a young person my voice is being heard. Meeting the Deputy Prime minister and highlighting some barriers that put some young people off getting involved has been the icing on the cake, if not a little nerve wracking! More and more people my age should feel motivated to get involved knowing that their ideas can turn into real action.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/2008646,Urban green spaces set to grow,"Environment Minister Richard Benyon and Planning Minister Bob Neill have launched the Green Infrastructure Partnership, which will support the development of green networks in urban areas and help communities make better use of their local infrastructure - turning it from grey to green.

The Partnership will investigate how local communities, planners and decision-makers can be supported in designing and developing new green infrastructure, make the case for new projects and look at how they can be improved to meet communities' needs.

Launching the Partnership is a Government commitment in the Natural Environment White Paper, published earlier in the year. The Partnership aims to work strategically at national level to promote the development and enhancement of green infrastructure.

Bob Neill, Minister Communities and Local Government said:

> ""Sustainable development must go hand in hand with protecting and making the best use of our valuable green spaces and rural corridors. The Green Infrastructure Partnership will be a key player in helping to develop the full potential of England's green infrastructure and demonstrating its social, economic and environmental benefits.""

A workship will be held in November 2011 to agree membership, roles and next steps.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/2018448,Celebs pledge to test their smoke alarms this weekend,"British broadcasting legend Sir Terry Wogan and comedian Dave Spikey have voiced their support for the latest Fire Kills campaign to get people testing their smoke alarms when the clocks go back this weekend.

With only half of people claiming they test their smoke alarm regularly, the clock change milestone is the perfect opportunity for everyone to test their alarm as they are already going around their homes putting the clocks back.

The campaign, which can be seen in national newspapers and heard on the airwaves this weekend, will come to an end on Sunday 30 October 2011.

Several organisations, including the Post Office, Energizer and Poundland have also been involved, spreading the message to their customers and staff.

Sir Terry Wogan said:

> ""A smoke alarm can give you the vital time you need to escape a house fire, but often people don't take the time to test their alarm is working. It doesn't take long and could save lives. When the clocks change at the end of the month, I'll be checking my smoke alarm.""

Dave Spikey said:

> ""I'll be checking the batteries in my smoke alarm on 30 October as being fire safe is very important. A working smoke alarm can give you the early warning you and your loved ones need to escape in a house fire.""

We're asking everyone to keep their family, friends and neighbours safe this weekend by testing. If you know somebody less able to reach their smoke alarm, why not offer to test it for them?

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/2021083,Andrew Stunell: Your parks and green spaces need you,"Andrew Stunell has announced that next year's Green Flag Award application round is open, and urged groups that manage green spaces and parks, including those managed and created by local communities, to step forward.

The Communities Minister also said that the scheme, which has continued to raise the standard of quality of green spaces since its start in 1996, has Government support to continue past 31 August 2012, the end of its current arrangement. Mr Stunell indicated the Government's intention will be to advertise next year for an external group to run the Green Flag Award scheme under license from 1 September 2012, and to invite bids. Details of the license offer will be available in February next year.

Andrew Stunell said:

> ""The Green Flag Award scheme continues to recognise the importance of our green spaces and the efforts of those who look after them. 2010/11 was the best year yet for the number of awards and long may this continue.""

The scheme has just had its most successful year, with 1,290 green spaces receiving an award and raising the standard: [www.keepbritaintidy.org/GreenFlag/News/Default.aspx?newsID=7712](http://www.keepbritaintidy.org/GreenFlag/News/Default.aspx?newsID=7712) (external link). The Green Flag Community Award category, which recognises those spaces run by voluntary and community groups, saw a 13 per cent increase in winning entries.

The Green Flag Award is the national standard for public green space, currently used by 77 per cent of local authorities for green space management. The awards are increasingly being used by communities to maintain and improve the quality of precious green spaces such as parks, community gardens, woodlands, and allotments.

The memorial garden has been revived and redesigned with the help and ideas from young people, who took part in Whitefriars Housing's summer 'Boot Camp' project.![Baroness Newlove at Wellington Gardens](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2021762)

### Helping young people improve their life chances

The Boot Camp course - the first of its kind to be run by a housing association - involved youngsters, some of whom, had been involved in low level anti-social behaviour taking part in a week of activities with the housing association. The course included physical challenges, CV writing, interview skills, and fundraising and community projects aimed at helping young people improve their life chances, with the most-improved going on to secure an apprenticeship with the housing organisation.

Baroness Newlove said:

> ""Young people have a really important role to play in helping to create stronger happier and safer communities. Instead of looking at them as part of the problem, it's far better to include them as part of the solution. They need only to be channelled in the right direction to release all their positive energy. Their bright ideas, creativity and enthusiasm can make a real and positive difference to their local neighbourhood.
> 
> ""It's so heart warming to see projects such as those run by Whitefriars housing. Their belief in the potential of young people to turn their lives around and make a positive contribution to the local area has not only led to the creation of this wonderful memorial garden that can be enjoyed by the whole community but it has also given these young people new skills that will help them on their way to a brighter future.""

Seventeen-year-old Katy O'Beirne, from Cheylesmore, was named the winner of Boot Camp and is now a housing apprentice with Whitefriars. Speaking at the Rose Community Centre, where local residents were shown a film of the success of Boot Camp, she said:

> ""Boot Camp gave me an opportunity to turn my life around and I really enjoyed the things we did.
> 
> ""I love being an apprentice and I want to work hard because I really value the opportunity I have been given.""

The memorial garden includes a sculpture from renowned Coventry-born sculptor Walter Ritchie, who died in 1997. Walter's partner Sally Taylor attended the official opening.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/2033553,Grant Shapps encourages communities to high jump red tape and celebrate London 2012 with their own street games,"Local Government Minister Grant Shapps today fired the starting pistol in the race to get Britain warmed up for London 2012 and plan Street Games.

The Minister urged communities across the country to dive right into the spirit of London 2012 and host sporting events in their own neighbourhoods - before, during and after the Games.

He also put the ball firmly in the court of local councils, urging them to ""high jump over red tape and regulations"" and make it easier for communities to come together for sack races, football tournaments and tug-of-war contests in their streets. And where poor weather threatens to stop play, Mr Shapps called on councils to look at how community halls could be offered as possible venues for local events.

Ministers want councils to avoid putting hurdles in the way of communities hosting their own street games, and become key team players in helping to hit the target of increasing the nation's participation in sport - a vital part of London 2012's enduring legacy.

The Minister argued that communities should box clever and avoid some of the common myths about hosting events such as Street Sports Days. The Government is taking steps to bust the many 'health and safety myths' that often prevent neighbourhoods from putting on their own events. These include:

  * The need for a licence - organisers do not need a licence unless they plan to sell alcohol or charge for a performance.
  * Fees charged for road closures - the Government has scrapped guidance that was used by councils as a means of charging people wanting to close their road, but now councils will charge nothing for this.
  * The need to buy expensive road signs and insurance - some councils lend signs and cones to organisers, while Streets Alive have downloadable signs from their website, which also includes advice on insurance; and
  * Plans to scrap the need for Temporary Entertainment Licences, making it easier for streets to play music at their Games. Under Government proposals, rules requiring people to apply and sometimes pay for licences for many events where there is little or no risk of trouble would be scrapped.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""Next year, people across the country will rightly want to celebrate London hosting the greatest sporting event in the world. But residents shouldn't have to wrestle with bureaucracy to put on their own events - it should be easy to team up and celebrate next year's Olympic Games with their own Street Games.
> 
> ""That's why I want councils to be the torch-bearers for getting the nation on their feet and getting more involved in sport. Rather than putting up the hurdles and preventing communities from putting on their own street games, I want them to high jump the red tape and regulations and make arranging local events easier.
> 
> ""We want London 2012 to be the best Games ever, but preparations should not be confined to the Capital. Getting ready for next year's once-in-a-lifetime event is a marathon, not a sprint, so I would urge councils and communities across the country to start planning now for their own celebrations.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/2034524,Housing Groups' reaction to the Housing Strategy,"**Rob Perrins, MD, Berkeley Homes Group,** said:

> ""The Berkeley Group welcomes this innovative initiative which will enable people who can afford the ongoing cost, but not the high upfront deposit required by today's market, to acquire a new-build home. As important is the stimulus to the wider economy. A strong housing market creates jobs and is such an integral part of consumer confidence for the UK. It is also a fantastic example of Government and the private sector working together to find solutions to today's market challenges.""

**Stewart Baseley, Executive Chairman of the Home Builders Federation**, welcomed the new build indemnity scheme. He said:

> ""In recent years many people have been unable to realise their dreams of buying a home because of the huge deposits required by lenders. This scheme will allow people to buy their new home on realistic terms and help in particular hard-pressed first time buyers.
> 
> ""It will also be a huge boost to house building. Since 2007, the biggest constraint on homes being built has been mortgage availability. This scheme will see more desperately needed homes being built, create jobs and give the economy the boost it needs.""

**Nick Jopling, Executive Property Director of residential landlord Grainger**, said:

> ""Today's surprise £400 million announcement to boost housing supply is a welcome shot in the arm for the housing sector and the UK economy as a whole. While it isn't the full answer to the UK's housing crisis, alongside the other measures expected in the national housing strategy, it will go some way to easing the chronic shortage of housing facing this country.""

**Stephen Stone, Chief Executive at housebuilder Crest Nicholson**, said:

> ""We have an acute housing crisis in this country and the long term undersupply of new homes has been severely aggravated by the recession. A healthy housing market is critical to the success of the economy, but restrictions to the mortgage market in the last few years have significantly hindered the rate of recovery.
> 
> ""The Government's proposed support of a mortgage indemnity scheme will give a vital boost to the market, doing much to unlock the funding restrictions facing the sector. The plans will be very much welcomed by the industry, and the expectation that such a scheme will generate a significant uplift in new home production is hugely encouraging.""

**Mark Clare, Chief Executive of Barratt Developments PLC**, said:

> ""This is exactly what the industry needs to ensure that customers can buy and we can build the homes the nation so desperately needs. Lack of mortgage finance is the single biggest issue we face and I'm confident that we can increase production to meet the very clear demand that exists for more homes.""

**RIBA Chief Executive, Harry Rich,** said:

> ""We have been pressing hard for more homes to be built in the UK and for these to be of high design quality. I am delighted that the government has listened and has given such prominence to design quality and the role of architects in driving good design within their communities and in delivering housing fit for the 21st century.""

**Andy Yallop, Group Chief Executive, Croudace Homes** said:

> ""House builders operate in a highly competitive market place and can only invest in land and future production if there is mortgage finance available for its customers. This new initiative will allow the many people who aspire to buy a new home to do so, something that has been impossible for many for the last three years. It will enable us to increase our future production and thereby increase the number of people employed.""

**Paul Smee, Council of Mortgage Lenders Director General**, on the new build indemnity scheme, said:

> ""This scheme is good news for home-buyers, developers and indeed the UK economy. Lenders will be able to reduce the level of deposit needed by home-buyers in the new build sector, enabling more buyers to buy and so supporting the flow of new housing development, with all its positive consequences for jobs and the economy as a whole.""

**Kate Henderson, Chief Executive of the Town and Country Planning Association**, said:

> ""We welcome the Government's pledge to provide more support for locally planned large scale development, where there is community support and private sector appetite, through the planning system and infrastructure prioritisation. A new generation of locally-led, comprehensively planned garden communities - including sustainable urban extensions, urban villages and new settlements - is overdue.""

Managed by volunteers from the Briar Residents Action Group (BRAG) and housed in former commercial premises, the Briar Road Information Shop aims to encourage a stronger relationship between the estate's 1,200 residents, Havering Council and other local agencies such as the police, by acting as a single point of contact providing services and advice.![Baroness Helen Newlove, pictured alongside Briar Residents Action Group (BRAG) Chair Win Gleed, a resident of Briar Road for 40 years](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2046403)

Following a Government grant, the group - working closely with the council and Homes in Havering - are taking action on a series of neighbourhood concerns from tackling burglary to recycling and have also held a number of community events. They are also engaged with the council on the redevelopment plans for Bosworth Field to create a new community area for all age groups that will include new sports pitches, new tree planting, and new seating areas.

Baroness Newlove said:

> ""This was my third visit to Briar Road to hear from local people making a real difference to their neighbourhood. It's so inspiring to meet community-minded residents who in their own time are doing everything they can to make their neighbourhoods safer and happier places to live and work.
> 
> ""I was honoured to be asked to open the information shop. I know that Briar Road residents, the council and Homes in Havering have all put a tremendous amount of time and effort in getting it up and running, giving people the knowledge and confidence to get involved for the benefit of the whole community.""

The Briar Road Estate is one of seven neighbourhoods across the country Baroness Newlove has been working closely with this year, to find out what works and what the barriers are to successful community activism.

His visit was to see the essential conservation work being carried out by the Auschwitz-Birkenau Foundation to preserve and maintain the former concentration camp as an important memorial to educate future generations of the tragedy of the Holocaust.![Communities Secretary Eric Pickles signing the visitor](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2051356)  
   
On his visit, the Secretary of State was joined by Piotr Cywinski, Director of the Auschwitz-Birkenau Museum and Jacek Kastelaniec, General Director of the Foundation and who explained how worldwide contributions - including £2.1 million of British Government funding, primarily from the Department for Communities and Local Government and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office - were helping to safeguard the remains of the camp and ensure its long-term preservation.

The memorial covers almost 200 hectares of grounds, 155 buildings, and 300 ruins, including the ruins of the gas chambers and crematoria, as well as a permanent exhibition of over 100 thousand personal items belonging to those murdered, archived documents, and the works of art made by prisoners.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said;

> ""Visiting Auschwitz has been a profound and moving experience. The buildings here are not just the historical remains of one of the darkest chapters in history. They go far beyond bricks and mortar. They are perpetual reminder of the pain and destructive force of hate.
> 
> ""It is our collective responsibility to ensure Auschwitz-Birkenau continues to stand as a centre of education, ensuring that the lessons of the Holocaust are taught today and to future generations. I have huge respect for the museum and the Auschwitz-Birkenau Foundation and its vital work in maintaining and restoring the memorial site.""

While in Krakow the Secretary of State also visited the Jewish Community Centre which was built and fully funded by the UK based international charity World Jewish Relief. 

Opened in April 2008, by His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall, the centre is now a focus for Krakow's Jewish Community to come together for social, educational and religious programmes. Following a meeting with the Centre's Director Jonathan Ornstein, Mr Pickles spent time with those who work, volunteer and benefit from the Centre. Among those he met were Zofia Radzikowska, a 76 year old Holocaust survivor studying Hebrew and Spanish who also visits the Senior Club every day.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/2060027,Grant Shapps: New deal will help older people live at home for longer,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today launched a new deal to help older people to continue living comfortably in their own homes - with particular support for those leaving hospital.

With nearly one in five of the whole population expected to be aged 65 or over by 2020, Ministers are determined to ensure elderly, vulnerable people get the help they need to live independent lives, and can be safe in the knowledge that they won't get ripped off by dodgy dealers and fraudsters.

So Mr Shapps has given £51 million towards Home Improvement Agencies, who will provide help and advice including:

  * housing advice, including help to move to more suitable accommodation if needed
  * handyperson services, including small home repairs, home safety and security adaptations
  * energy efficiency advice; and
  * arranging for adaptations and home repairs to be made, including grab rails, stair-lifts and major work such as ground floor extensions.

These agencies also offer hospital discharge services - ensuring older people leaving hospital care are given the support they need to be able to recuperate in the comfort of their own homes.

For those needing adaptations to their homes, Grant Shapps has also confirmed an additional £20 million for Disabled Facilities Grants - bringing the total to £200 million this year alone.

He has also announced £1.5 million funding for FirstStop, which provides independent advice to older people looking to plan their future housing needs - whether in their own homes, or in care homes. This is in addition to work already underway to look at new and innovative ways in which elderly people can fund their future care needs without having to resort to selling their property.

And to plan for the needs of older households in the future, Mr Shapps has announced plans for councils to consider the needs of their ageing residents in their local housing plans, by planning the numbers of new homes built  to ensure they include features that meet the needs of older people, such as wider doors for wheelchairs and walk-in showers.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""As we get older the last thing we want is for our properties to become our prisons. We want to be able to enjoy the comfort of our own homes in our later years. But with nearly a fifth of our population expected to be over 65 by 2020, radical and urgent change is needed to ensure the nation's housing meets the growing and changing demands that this is bringing, and will bring in the future.
> 
> ""That's why today I'm offering a new deal for older people, backed with millions of pounds of Government cash, to ensure elderly residents get the support they need to live independently and comfortably in their own homes for as long as they can, with particular support for those leaving hospital. Older people will be able to get the adaptations, repairs and improvements to their home that they need, safe in the knowledge that the help they are getting is from trusted tradesmen and advisers - not dodgy dealers and fraudsters out to exploit their situation.
> 
> ""As Britain's population gets older, our homes must adapt to meet our changing needs. Today's multi-million pound new deal for older people will help achieve this.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/2088812,Grant Shapps: Setting the benchmark for transparency in social housing,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today (14 February 2012) praised the latest social landlord to open its books and become more transparent to tenants.

The Minister said Viridian's plans to publish all expenditure over £500 from April this year would not only make them more accountable to their tenants, but would also help them increase efficiency.

Mr Shapps used the announcement to call on other housing associations to follow the example of Viridian and Home Group.

Since becoming Housing Minister, Mr Shapps has consistently challenged all social landlords to match his Department's commitment on transparency.

The Coalition believes that all organisations in receipt of public money can achieve better value for money when they ensure that transactions are open to real scrutiny. 

Mr Shapps said social landlords would be left behind if they failed to acknowledge the growing demands of tenants to see how their rent is being spent and that it was time to meet those expectations.  
  
Over the next few months officials from the Department for Communities and Local Government will hold a series of discussions with individual housing associations to discuss how they can become more transparent in the way they run their business.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said: 

> ""Housing associations have a long and distinguished track record of providing the affordable homes that millions of tenants rely on. But with more pressure on the public purse than ever, all organisations that receive money from the taxpayer should expect to come under greater scrutiny. It should feel entirely natural to be willing to explain their financial decisions.  
   
""So I'm delighted that Viridian, like Home Group before them, has taken this key decision to become more transparent for their tenants. Nowadays transparency is not just a nice-to-have add-on, it's vital for driving down costs and ensuring more is achieved with every taxpayers' pound. Large amounts of public money have been invested in social housing - so tenants and the public now deserve to know if their money is being well spent.""

Ministers have been alarmed that the sector has been too slow to respond to the public demand for openness and believe bringing housing associations under the Freedom of Information Act could make it easier for tenants and the public to find out more about how their landlords work.

The Government has committed to consult with social landlords on whether to extend the scope of the Act to include housing associations.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/2094708,"Ministers see riot-recovery underway in Greenwich, Manchester and Salford","Ministers have visited more towns that were badly affected by the riots, to see progress six months on and meet the local people, traders and council workers getting their communities back on track.

Following the Secretary of State Eric Pickles visit to Tottenham last week, Local Government Minister Bob Neill visited Woolwich and Communities Minister Andrew Stunell headed to Manchester and Salford.

Following the riots the Government acted quickly to make available a multi-million pound package of support to enable councils to act swiftly and confidently to restore communities and get support to local people and businesses.

### Woolwich

Mr Neill returned to Woolwich to see first hand how the community is using the support available to restore, rebuild and improve the town centre. He was first there in the immediate aftermath of the riots.![Bob Neill visits Woolwich after the riots](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2094721)

Calling into local businesses, Mr Neill talked to traders about the impact of the riots and how the community rallied round to help get them get back on their feet.

Local council leader Chris Roberts and Chief Executive Mary Ney accompanied the Minister. The council set up the Greenwich Backing Local Business fund and opened a special advice surgery for more than 60 businesses to drop in to get expert advice and support.

Communities Minister Bob Neill said:

> ""The picture here in Woolwich is very different to the one I saw in the immediate aftermath of the riots. Despite the attempts of a few to wreak havoc, the community in Woolwich have pulled together to restore their town.
> 
> ""The progress well underway in Woolwich is symbolic of a community that is proud of their local area, their local businesses and determined to see their town thrive.""

### Manchester and Salford

Meeting local people, traders and council workers in Manchester and Salford, Communities Minister Andrew Stunell praised the energetic way communities came together in the aftermath of the riots and pointed to the true examples of community spirit in action.

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""Whilst the actions of a small minority determined on causing destruction caught our attention for a moment, it is the examples of true community spirit that will endure; the 'broom armies', the campaigns to support local businesses, the messages of pride in the area posted on shop fronts.
> 
> ""It's been great to meet the people that paint the real picture of community life in Manchester and Salford and see that recovery and progress is well underway.""

Mr. Stunell also met with council leaders in both areas to discuss the impact of the riots and the support improvement in the areas. An 'I love Salford' campaign was launched to build up the community spirit and invite people to show their support for their area by shopping locally and wearing campaign badges. In Manchester a campaign group called 'Eye on Manchester' rallied support from locals to help in the clean up.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/2121468,Downing Street launch for Troubled Families Scheme,"Local authority leaders and frontline community workers were this week invited to a reception in Downing Street to mark the start of the Government's groundbreaking initiative to turn around the lives of troubled families.![David Cameron meets with local authority leaders and community workers at a reception at No10 to mark the start of troubled families initiative.](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2121407)

David Cameron was in attendance along with Cabinet ministers including Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles, Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith and Home Secretary Theresa May, as well as Head of Troubled Families Policy Louise Casey.

Welcoming guests to Number 10 the Prime Minister expressed his ""passion"" for the project which is turning around the lives of the 120,000 most challenging families in England in the next three years.

The reception came on the day that the Department for Communities and Local Government launched its unique payment by results programme that will reward upper tier local authorities with up to £4,000 per family if they get children off the streets and into school; reduce youth crime and antisocial behaviour; and put parents on a path back to work.![David Cameron meets with local authority leaders and community workers at a reception at No10 to mark the start of troubled families initiative.](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2121413)

The 10 authorities with the largest amount of troubled families, amounting to a fifth of those that are being targeted, are all signed up to the £448 million scheme and ready to begin work in the new financial year with many more expected in the coming months. All 152 top-tier council chief executives were invited to the event along with new Troubled Families Co-ordinators and frontline workers from the public and voluntary sectors.

The Prime Minister told guests that:

> ""It's great to have so many people here from local government and so many people from different organisations and institutes that care about families. Today we're celebrating a step forward in the programme of trying to deal with the most troubled families, and that is producing the payment by results model to make money available for local authorities.
> 
> ""We all know there are some deeply troubled families in our country who are responsible for a huge amount of social problems, for themselves but also for the wider community - the children aren't going to school, the parents aren't in work, they are responsible for a huge amount of crime and antisocial behaviour, and they are deeply, deeply chaotic.
> 
> ""I am very proud of the fact that this Government has decided to roll up its sleeves and really try and deal with these problems, it's a hugely important area of work.""

Also speaking at the event, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles added that:

> ""We've brought the Government together, but the most important thing is this: that we all in this room - whether you're a politician, a chief executive, somebody from a charity - we have a real chance of turning these lives around.
> 
> ""We talk about the money its costing, but it is a human waste. People on a system that's leading nowhere, and we've got a chance to make a difference, and I am very much looking forward to working with all of you in the months to come.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/2144581,£10m investment to connect Northampton Enterprise Zone,"Today Communities Secretary Eric Pickles and Transport Secretary Justine Greening announced a £10 million boost for transport infrastructure in Northampton's Enterprise Zone.

The money is being invested in the development of the Castle Railway Station at the heart of Northampton Enterprise Zone. The new station will provide vital infrastructure capacity to support local plans for sustainable economic growth.

The Northampton Enterprise Zone is building on the areas strengths in advanced technologies, high performance engineering, and low carbon technology. With access to super fast broadband, up to 100 per cent business rates discounts and simplified planning process the Zone is already attracting big business hitters like Carlsberg, providing more jobs and boosting the local economy.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""Northampton is using its Enterprise Zone to energise the local economy and boost business. As these new opportunities for innovation and enterprise open up it is vital the infrastructure is in place to match Northampton's ambitions.
> 
> ""This £10 million for the Castle Railway station is another step forward in Northampton's resurgence as a place where local communities thrive.""

Communities Minster Andrew Stunell added:

> ""Improving the transport links to this ambitious area will help Northampton to unleash its potential as a centre for local growth and innovation.
> 
> ""Turning Castle Station into a key transport hub at the heart of the Enterprise Zone is just one more reason for business to invest in this area and bring new jobs and homes that will benefit the whole community.""

Together with funding from Network Rail and Northamptonshire County Council the Government's contribution will go towards phase one of the redevelopment scheme which includes a new station building and access to the platforms, which will be a major improvement for residents and visitors to the area.

The West Northamptonshire Development Corporation, the agency driving regeneration in West Northamptonshire, can now look at how they can take forward subsequent phases of the redevelopment which will include a new larger car park and release of land for commercial opportunities close to the station.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/planningandbuilding/16102161,Support for powers to end 'garden grabbing',"'Garden grabbing' is currently keeping CLG Ministers' inboxes full as last week's announcement ignites a debate across the country.

Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark has received letters and e-mails from all over the country since announcing he would change the classification of garden land so councils and communities would no longer have their decisions constantly overruled.

Gardens will be taken out of the Brownfield category, where they currently sit alongside derelict factories and disused railway sidings, thus dramatically changing councils' ability to prevent unwanted development on gardens.

Amanda Lazar from Bournemouth wrote saying she was ""thrilled by the change"". She explained, ""I have been horrified to see house after house being bulldozed over the last eight or so years, and blocks of tiny flats put up in their places, with beautiful, mature gardens being tarmacked over to provide parking spaces"". She added that this risked ""a whole generation of children"" growing up without a garden.

Over the last decade, many councils have been left frustrated at being unable to prevent a dramatic increase in the number of new houses being built on previously residential land such as back gardens - up from one in ten to one in four between 1997 and 2008.

The move to reclassify gardens has received positive support for the move from councils and members of the public from across the country.

One Solihull resident wrote to his paper:

> ""This week's news…is music to my ears. Some sensible and sensitive schemes will be approved but it can only be hoped that the majority of terrible applications will now be prevented. And what is most important is that it is Solihull Council's planning committee that will be making decisions about Solihull - not a government.""

In St Albans a local residents' association that helped campaign to protect open space said:

> ""We have a lot of cases where exactly this has happened and there have been many back garden developments we are just not able to stop.""

In Bournemouth the Civic Society said:

> ""It's great that at last we've got something that's going to give the local authorities the tools to do the job that they want to do and protect those areas that are special.""

While in Stoke one campaigner said the plans were ""good news"", adding ""It's just putting things back into context. I'm not against a neighbour developing their property but it has to be in the same theme as the existing property"".

Campaigners in Derby added it would give the council more power to ""actually look at these developments objectively and give them the powers to refuse them if they don't meet the new guidelines.""

The Royal Horticultural Society have also welcomed the moved alongside the RSPB.

Greg Clark said:

> ""People across the country have been campaigning for years to protect their gardens and green space. Changing the classification of garden land so councils and communities no longer have their decisions constantly overruled will make a real difference to them.
> 
> ""This is just the start - we're committed to a planning system where local people are heard and councils, not Whitehall, are at the centre of decision-making for their community.""

Chief Planning Officer Steve Quartermain is today writing to all local authorities to ensure they are aware of the change.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/planningandbuilding/16225341,Positive planning for new free schools,"New planning principles for councils to consider when determining planning applications for school developments with local support were published ahead of the Royal Assent of the [Academies Bill](http://www.education.gov.uk/academies/bill) (external link) this week.

The changes will allow school promoters to be confident about progressing their proposals and for new free schools to be set up quickly in response to demand from local people. The Education Secretary has already stated Government is committed to making it easier to secure sites for new schools.

Free Schools are independent state schools run by teachers not bureaucrats or politicians and accountable to parents. Free Schools will enable excellent teachers to create new schools and improve standards for all children.

Local Planning Authorities and the Planning Inspectorate will be expected to take the [statement](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm100726/wmstext/100726m0001.htm#1007264000446) (external link) into account as a material consideration when determining all planning applications for school development. In determining planning applications, local authorities should:

  * attach very significant weight to the desirability of establishing new schools and to enabling local people to do so;
  * adopt a positive and constructive approach towards applications to create new schools, and seek to mitigate any negative impacts of development through the use of planning conditions or planning obligations, as appropriate; and
  * only refuse planning permission for a new school if the adverse planning impacts on the local area outweigh the desirability of establishing a school in that area.  Where a local authority refuses permission on this basis, the Government will ask the Planning Inspectorate to deal swiftly with any appeal that is lodged.

The Government will shortly be consulting on proposed changes to the Use Classes Order to reduce unnecessary regulation and make it easier for buildings currently used for other uses to be converted to schools.

### Key facts

1. The coalition programme for government states that: We will promote the reform of schools in order to ensure that new providers can enter the state school system in response to parental demand; that all schools have greater freedom over the curriculum; and that all schools are held properly to account.

2. The Education Secretary has stated the Government's commitment to making it easier to secure sites for new schools would include allowing a wider range of sites, including residential and commercial property, to be used as schools without the need for 'change of use' consent. There will also be an extension of powers to protect existing schools sites, to make sure they are kept available for use by new schools where there is demand.

The £500million Centenary Quay development is being built on the site of the former Vosper Thornycroft shipyard in Woolston. Alongside 1,600 new homes, of which more than 400 will be available to buy at an affordable price, the new site will also include a library, supermarket and a hotel, as well as bars and restaurants.  
   


> ""I am delighted to have laid the foundations for this exciting and extensive development on the Centenary Quay in Southampton.""

The project is expected to create more than 1,000 new jobs for the area.

Speaking at the site, Mr Pickles set out a comprehensive range of measures the Government has taken to get Britain building again.

The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government said:

> ""I am delighted to have laid the foundations for this exciting and extensive development on the Centenary Quay. The work started here will not only lead to more than 400 new affordable homes, it will also mean a new library, supermarket, bars and restaurants for Southampton residents.
> 
> ""But for every new development like this, there are communities across the country in desperate need of new and affordable housing in their area.

> ""That's why even though we are making efforts to cut the record budget deficit we have confirmed £1.25billion to guarantee most of the unfunded spending commitments made by the previous administration.
> 
> ""This alone will protect over 8,000 jobs, and will mean work can start on 9,500 new social homes and 3,000 homes for sale at affordable prices.""

### Government measures to boost housebuilding

Housebuilding is currently at its lowest level than for any peacetime year since 1924. Since May, the Government has set out a range of measures to boost this. These include:

  * Scrapping regional housing targets, with plans to introduce new homes bonuses to encourage councils to approve new developments in their area
  * Securing £1.25billion of the previous administration's £1.5billion Housing Pledge, despite the lack of sustainable funding and a massive government budget deficit
  * Outlining plans for a new Right to Build, which will enable rural communities to set up local housing trusts and grant themselves planning permission for small numbers of new homes - subject to overwhelming public support expressed in a local referendum.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/regeneration/1681360,More local homes means more rewards,"Local communities that build more local homes will be rewarded by getting more funding to use in their local area on things they consider to be a priority. Communities will be able to use their reward for going for growth on whatever they wish locally, such as council tax discounts for residents or facilities like playgrounds.

The New Homes Bonus, to be introduced early in the Spending Review period, will mean more homes built where they are needed and is intended to reverse the decline in the number of homes being built, currently languishing at its lowest peacetime level for 80 years.

The Minister confirmed that councils who take action now to give planning consent and support the construction of new homes where they are needed and wanted will receive direct and substantial benefit for their actions.

Mr Shapps urged councils to open up an honest and direct debate with the communities they serve about the benefits of building new homes in their area - how they can reap the benefits of development and not just the costs.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""We will not tell communities how or where they should grow. But the new Homes Bonus will ensure that those communities that go for growth reap the benefits of development, not just the costs.
> 
> ""With housebuilding at its lowest peacetime levels for over 80 years action is needed now to build the homes the country needs. That's why these new powerful incentives to build will be introduced early in the Spending Review period. And it's why I have confirmed that those councils who go for growth now will reap the rewards. So I urge councils to seize the moment and open up a debate with their communities now about the new homes they need and how they would use the new Bonus.""

The Government wants to hear the views of councils, communities and industry as it finalises the scheme. A consultation paper on the final scheme will be published following the spending review.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/regeneration/17377041,Thames Gateway remains open for business,"The Thames Gateway remains open for business, stated its Minister Bob Neill at the key regeneration conference for the Thames Gateway.

At the Thames Gateway Forum, speaking to an audience of business leaders and local partners in Councils and other delivery bodies, Bob Neill outlined the changing relationship with the people of Thames Gateway and said that talk of its demise was wrong.

The minister hailed achievements to date - new businesses like DP World, Ikea, Westfield and Southend Airport - all bringing skills and jobs into the area. He said that even in a time of financial restraint, it had been possible to maintain commitments to large scale projects like the ongoing £14.5 billion investment in Crossrail which will connect residents and businesses south of the river with the rest of London. And world class projects like the Sustainable Industries Park in Dagenham which provides the foundation for green technology to become the backbone of the Thames Gateway.

He announced a new Review of the Kent Thameside Strategic Transport Programme for North Kent.

He also announced he would formally be a partner in the leadership body of the Thames Gateway, simplifying the plethora of bodies into the new Thames Gateway Strategic Group.

Bob Neill said:

> ""Rumours of the Thames Gateway's demise are somewhat wide of the mark. In the future the government will play its part, being a full partner in making it a better place. We will work tirelessly on the Thames Gateway's behalf - promoting it at home and abroad, making a success of the Olympics and infrastructure schemes like Crossrail, and providing the people and places of the Thames Gateway with the tools they need to make it a success.
> 
> ""But it is your Thames Gateway: its future lies in your hands. Let's work together with the Thames Gateway Strategic Group and local people in the years ahead to continue its success. We're putting power back in the hands of local people and their representatives.""

He also spoke with pride of the Olympic and Paralympic Games being hosted in the Thames Gateway, providing the opportunity to showcase the Gateway as a place not just to play but in which to invest. He said:

> ""The Games themselves will be an inspiration, but the legacy they leave will be the measure of their success. That's why, despite the current economic climate, the government has secured in the spending review half a billion pounds to transform the games' venues and park into a whole new district of London as well as improvements to public space in the host Boroughs.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/regeneration/1930672,Bob Neill hails the Great British seaside at international coastal conference,"Communities Minister Bob Neill spoke about the enormous economic potential of the Great British seaside in a speech at the first ever international conference for coastal communities.

Held in the seaside setting of Clacton, the conference discussed how seaside towns can become economic hubs and shared success stories from as far a field as France, Italy, and Malta.

The event was hosted by Tendring District Council, Essex County Council and the Council of Europe.

Communities Minister Bob Neill said:

> ""Event's like this are an important way to highlight to unique role coastal areas and seaside towns play in Britain's history, culture and economy.
> 
> ""Come rain or shine we all have fond memories of trips to the Great British Seaside, but they are more than holiday destinations we also need to ensure they are great places to live and work. Many seaside towns are showing how they can become year round places of business given the opportunity.
> 
> ""The Government is committed to rebalancing local economies through local enterprise partnerships and small business tax breaks as well as by putting local people back in charge of their own economic growth through neighbourhood plans and community incentives like the New Homes Bonus.""

Neil Stock, Leader of Tendring District Council, said:

> ""Businesses are willing to invest if they get the right messages from the public sector. It is up us to create the right environment for them to operate and draw in the money which will lead to more jobs and regeneration in Tendring.""

### Communities back in control

Putting local authorities and communities back in charge and giving them the freedom to drive their own economic development and growth is a key priority for the Government:

  * Through the Localism Bill, the Government is devolving greater powers to councils and neighbourhoods, so local communities are able to shape their own future.

  * The Government has invited local business and local councils to come together and take charge of their local economy and establish local enterprise partnerships. The new network of 35 Local Enterprise partnerships covers 95 per cent of all businesses and 96 per cent of the population in England.

  * Kent, Greater Essex and East Sussex local enterprise partnerships, who attended the conference, are already working together and have set up a new group to look at some of the issues facing the coastal towns in their area.

  * To further encourage investment across the country the Government is creating 21 new Enterprise Zones to be developed within the local enterprise partnerships. Businesses in Enterprise Zones will benefit from superfast broadband, lower business tax rates, low levels of regulation and planning controls, and reduced business rates.
