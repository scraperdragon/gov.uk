Christianity in all its forms has shaped the heritage, morality and public life of Britain; and Christian belief continues to influence our society for the better. The fact that Britain has welcomed people of many other faiths to live among us over the centuries in no way detracts from this. Indeed, it is the Christian ethos that has made Britain so welcoming.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/articles/corporate/2245595,We must ease the bumps in business rates road for a smoother recovery,"* * *

Business rates are the third biggest outgoing for local firms after rent and staff costs. As a very direct and visible tax demand, unsurprisingly, such bills aren't that popular with business.

A revaluation at this point would be likely to result in sharp changes to business-rate bills in many parts of the country and in many sectors.

Business rates are tied to inflation, but every five years, the way bills are calculated are revised in a revaluation undertaken by professionals in the Valuation Office Agency.

Parliament will shortly debate a new Growth and Infrastructure Bill, and its provisions include postponing the next business rates revaluation in England to 2017.

This decision will avoid local firms and local shops facing unexpected hikes in their business-rates bills over the next five years. As business rates will remain linked to inflation, there will be no real-terms increase in rates over this period.

The last revaluation was based on April 2008 valuations and rents set at the height an unsustainable property boom during the last administration. Since then, the economy and property market have faced exceptional changes. A revaluation at this point would be likely to result in sharp changes to business-rate bills in many parts of the country and in many sectors.

Rents have fallen since that property boom. Some people assume falling business rents somehow equal falling business rates: everyone's a winner. That might happen in a perfect world, but not in the complex citadel of local government finance.

Business-rates bills are calculated by taking the rateable value of a property (roughly equivalent to their notional yearly rent), and applying a 'multiplier'. While aggregate rateable values have fallen, this would automatically be offset at the revaluation by a higher rating multiplier. Firms would just be required to pay a higher proportion of their rateable value. The Valuation Office Agency's best estimate of rateable value movements suggests there had been a 13 per cent drop in values in England since the last valuation.

Because revaluations are revenue neutral overall the tax take would have had to rise by 20 per cent to 56.9p in the pound following the 2015 revaluation. In essence, it works like a tax see-saw. Whether the value goes down on one side or up on the other, the taxman will demand the same overall tax take. Suspending the revaluation will not earn the Government a penny, but it does help us steady that see-saw.

Of course, with any revaluation, there will be some winners. There will be losers, too.

If a small number of high-value sectors and areas saw very sharp declines then the average fall could be very large indeed - meaning that many more businesses whose rents have fallen but by less than the national average would have seen tax increases from 2015. By definition, we have not undertaken a formal revaluation, so any figures will be rough estimates.

The Valuation Office Agency's best estimate of rental value movements across England, which ahead of carrying out the detailed work necessary for a revaluation is based on professional judgments informed by limited rental market evidence up to January 2012, illustrate that many businesses with reducing rateable values could expect to see increases in their actual rates bills.

Extrapolating from these early estimates suggests that 800,000 premises would see a real-terms rise in their rates bill, where only 300,000 premises would see their bill fall.

Smaller and medium firms are likely to be harder hit. Some in the retail sector have criticised the postponement of the revaluation: yet our estimates suggest that retail is one of the sectors which will face big hikes in bills because of the revaluation, alongside the likes of petrol stations, hotels and pubs.

Transitional relief may be able to compensate initially some of the losers by clawing back most of the gains from the smaller number of winners (so-called downward phasing).

However, we do not think that such immense volatility at this point in time would be in the wider public interest, particularly when we want to ensure the economy is growing.

The Government is committed to maintaining up-to-date rates bills through regular five-yearly revaluations in England, which will resume after 2017, once the economy has had a chance to recover fully from the financial and fiscal crisis this Government inherited.

The engines of economic growth aren't found in the corridors of Whitehall but in the foundries of great local British companies. The best thing Government can do to help such businesses is to provide them with a stable economic environment. This is why we want to protect local firms from soaring tax bills.

When the Prime Minister asked me to become the new housing minister I was both surprised and delighted.

I had enjoyed my role as business minister and I am proud of the work I have done, whether it be overseeing a record number of small business start-ups or the investment of £6billion into the UK automotive industry.

Yet as a constituency MP and as a chartered surveyor, I recognise that the state of housing in this country is an issue which affects everyone. So it's great to have the chance to help unlock the housing market, get homes built and see more families enjoy the security that comes from being able to step over their own threshold.

_Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version._

### Introduction

> ""India has an unparalleled desire, an unquenchable enthusiasm, an unshakeable belief in the future.""

It's a privilege to be here tonight and to follow such distinguished guest speakers.

Anyone who knows me will know I love India, from India's democracy - the largest in the history of the world - a pillar of stability in an unsettled region, to the music of Ravi Shankar that fills my iPod. Not to mention, of course, India's great cricketing heritage.

And standing here at the home of cricket magical memories of golden summers come flooding back: Kapil Dev striking four consecutive sixes to save the follow on; Rahul Dravid lifting his bat to celebrate a century, engraving his name on the honours board for all time. Like many neutrals I was sad to see India exit the TwentyTwenty World Cup at an early stage. As a long suffering England fan I certainly knew how Indian fans must be feeling.

### India's ambition

Yet there is something else about India that I admire. Something contained in its literature, its mathematics, its music, its films and its sport. Something that its great companies like George's Muthoot Group and golden peacock winners past and present display in abundance. And that is ambition.

India has an unparalleled desire, an unquenchable enthusiasm, an unshakeable belief in the future. It epitomises Gandhi's words to:

> ""Be the change you want to see in the world.""

I first came across that ambition as a youngster growing up in Bradford. I saw how the Indian community was a vibrant, galvanising, positive force that transformed local life.

> ""Britain is the place to be... a place where sustainable companies can strut their stuff.""

Today I see that ambition again in the way the wildfire of economic liberalisation has ignited the Indian economy, spreading growth from city to city, from the fantastic new airports in Bangalore and Hyderabad, to the Bandra-Worli Sea Link in Mumbai and to the metro to Delhi. And it is the tremendous driving force of India's ambition that has set it firmly on the path towards becoming an economic superpower.

### Britain is the land of opportunity

Now there's an old Hindi saying that I believe translates as:

> ""Gone abroad and come home a peacock.""

And for those with ambition Britain is the place to be. This is the land of opportunity - a place where sustainable companies can strut their stuff. We didn't just host an Olympic Games last month, we didn't just create an Olympic stadium - more sustainable than any of its predecessors, we didn't just run the most successful Paralympics ever - at which our very own golden Peacock (Jonnie Peacock) smashed the world 100 metres record. We founded an Olympic legacy.

You will find it ten miles to the east in the blossoming Olympic Park in Stratford. A once desolate wasteland  that now houses new sporting wonders of the world, that stand alongside Westfield - Europe's largest new shopping centre and next to a new tech city.

### Growth across the country

This picture of growth is being replicated right the way across the country, from the Thames Gateway to the Atlantic Gateway, from the Marches to Manchester, from the Solent to Sheffield.

We've taken a leaf out of India's Panchayati Raj system and recognised that we're better off when we take power out of the hands of senior elected representatives and let local communities take charge.

So we've now got Local Enterprise Partnerships - coalitions of local business and local authorities - forming natural economic alliances.

And creating Enterprise Zones - with relaxed planning rules, superfast broadband and generous business rates to fire up their local economies and attract eager inward investors.

Meanwhile, we've let our great cities like Birmingham Liverpool and Nottingham off the leash to renew their industrial might of old and conquer new frontiers in bioscience and advanced manufacturing.

### Building on a great relationship

Now we're proud of our relationship with India, proud that companies of the calibre of our winners today can come here. Proud that Tata's investment in steel production and car manufacture is safeguarding jobs from Teesside to Wolverhampton. Proud that 180 Indian firms invest in our IT sector. Together it's a relationship that brings in £16.8billion a year.

And as someone who loves India, you can only imagine my pleasure at becoming a member of a Government committed to strengthening an already powerful bond.

After all, when times are tough in the Eurozone and the world in general, supporting open markets and free enterprise becomes more important, not less. And supporting the trade, commerce and investment between our two countries is more essential, more valuable, than ever before. So that's why we are expanding our frontline diplomatic staff.

That's why the Prime Minister and Chancellor made a point of visiting within months of taking office, accompanied by many British CEOs. And it is why today you will find British businesses across the land eyeing up the opportunities India is offering. They know that India is looking to invest $1trillion in infrastructure in the years ahead. And having tested their mettle on the biggest infrastructure project in Europe, having worked on projects like Crossrail, they are champing at the bit to help a country whose destiny will be to remould our future.

### Conclusion

Now over in the Olympic Park you will find a great totem to Anglo-Indian ambition, the towering ArcelorMittal Orbit, 115 metres of steel proudly proclaiming that, when it comes to our friendship, the sky is the limit.

And it is my hope to visit India early in the new year, to do absolutely everything I can to realise the enormous promise of our relationship. To help British and Indian companies ruffle some feathers, grasp the burgeoning opportunities out there, and in the coming years bring a pride of golden peacocks home to roost.

_Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version._

In one week's time the Jewish community will be celebrating Rosh Hashanah. Both the Jewish New Year and a Day of Remembrance. But when it comes to the Holocaust the duty of remembrance falls on us all.

Remembrance is not to be confused with memory. Remembrance is the conscious effort: to step into somebody else's shoes; to light a candle for the generation that has gone before; to cast light on the millions of lives snuffed out; to illuminate the lost byways, the forgotten streets, the villages ransacked of life and laughter.

Remembrance fills the void statistics leaves behind. It tells us who was the mother, the father, the daughter, the son. It helps us imagine who might have lit up their community. Who might have become the next Einstein, or the next Ludgwig Guttman. The Jewish refugee from Nazism who founded the fantastic Paralympics.

And there is no better aid to remembrance than education. So I want to pay tribute to the Holocaust Educational Trust for your work. It makes me proud to think, almost a quarter of a century on from your founding by Lord Janner and the late Lord Rees, that you continue to shine a light into history's darkest recesses. To provide teaching resources to classrooms and campuses.To send out hugely impressive volunteers. Not just to speak of the unimaginable depths of human suffering. But - since some of those volunteers are also survivors - to bear witness to the illimitable strength of the human spirit.

And, of course, the Trust continues to send young people to witness despair's cul de sac at Auschwitz Birkenau. Having made that journey myself I know it never leaves you. Nor the chill of realising that destructive hate could strike, not in some medieval dark age, but in our modern world. In the cradle of our Western civilisation. In the birthplace of Durer, Kant and Shiller.

Now the man who pioneered these one day visits to Auschwitz was Rabbi Barry Marcus. And he has been a constant on every single visit over the past 13 years. In that time he has met some 17000 students and teachers. To each he poses the same searching question. Not - where was God in Auschwitz - but where was man? It is a profound challenge that forces us to confront Primo Levi's terrible truth that:

> ""It happened, therefore it can happen again"".

Because Holocaust remembrance is never just about the past, it is a shofar blast to us here today. A shofar blast against prejudice. A shofar blast against discrimination. A shofar blast that would deny hate any sanctuary, any refuge, any hiding place. So future generations might walk our streets without fear.

Recently one six former returning from a trip to Auschwitz said:

> ""This experience will affect me for the rest of my life, and I will try to use it to remind myself and others how extremely dangerous prejudices can be.""

That is why we continue supporting Holocaust remembrance and visits to Auschwitz. And why it is now my privilege and pleasure to present Rabbi Marcus - scion of Talmudic nobility - with an honour of his own. A small token of thanks for his immense contribution not just to the Jewish community but to our wider society.

_Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version._

Well, it's great to be here to today. Talking about pubs and beer. And I'm in exalted company.

![Pub sign](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2149202.jpg)George & Dragon pub

British historian A.J.P. Taylor thought; 

> ""most of the great men of the past were only there for the beer.""

He appears to have been right.

William Shakespeare said:

> ""A quart of ale is a dish for a king.""

Dr Johnson believed:

> ""There is nothing which has been yet contrived by man, by which so much happiness is produced as by a good tavern or inn.""

And when, in the July election of 1945, Times editor suggested to Winston Churchill that he retire gracefully soon after the campaign… the great man replied;

> ""Mr. Editor, I leave when the pub closes.""

All these patrons knew what we know. That what we drink and where we drink tells us who we are. And nothing says Britain more than our Great British pub and our Great British beer.

They are part of a tradition dating back to ancient times. Beer was drunk in the taverns of Roman England. In the Anglo-Saxon alehouse. In the inns of the Middle Age.

> ""The 'local' is the beating heart of our communities""

Before I came here today I did a bit of a pub crawl - online of course. It turns out that within a one mile radius of this building there are more than 400 pubs. And their names might as well be chapters from a history of Britain.

  * Boadicea
  * Shakespeare
  * George and the Dragon
  * Silver Cross
  * Battle of Trafalgar

And it's curious how history reflected in a pint glass, is history brought sharply into focus.

We can almost see Samuel Pepys witnessing the Great Fire of London in 1666 from ""a little alehouse on Bankside"".

Doctor Johnson penning his famous Dictionary at The Anchor in Southwark.

Dirty Den handing Anj the divorce papers on a Christmas night in the Queen Vic.

And Bet Lynch leaving the Rovers Return for the last time.

But while pubs are tied to our past they are equally an essential part of our present.

We call it the 'local' because it is the beating heart of our communities.

The place we gather.

> to socialise  
to celebrate  
to commiserate  
to champion and to cherish our way of life

But I'm not going to get all misty eyed today.

> ""Pubs and beer mean business.""

Pub and beer mean business. And a heady mix of the worlds best beer and the world's best brewers…

> …a potent cocktail of our famous beer companies  
…our industrious family brewers  
…our innovative microbreweries…  
...have made this industry a colossus.

The facts speak for themselves.

Individually, according to the British Beer and Pub Association, each pub contributes an estimated £80,000 to its local economy. Collectively, they contribute over £19 billion to the national economy. And in total they're sustaining nearly 900,000 jobs.

That's why for all their historical and cultural significance, our pubs must be a vital part of our economic future.

Now it's been a tough few years for your industry. But we're not abandoning the local to its fate.

We've made sure small business rate relief - which we've doubled until the end of March next year - and rural rate relief are available to our public houses.

We're distilled rules on weights and measures for intoxicating liquor into simplified form.

And we're canning sales of alcohol below cost-price by supermarkets. Most pubs should experience the benefit of this minimum unit price.

And we're even making it far easier for you to play live music at your venues. Taking away the usual licensing rules from performances where the audience numbers 200 or fewer. We want people to make a song and a dance. But, in the pub, not over the paperwork.

These reforms will, I hope be the fillip the industry needs as we look forward to a summer of royal and sporting celebration. A triple whammy of festivity. The Diamond Jubilee, Olympics, the European Championship. Events that will have punters across the world beating a path to your door.

Now I want to make sure I do everything I can to make sure you're in the shape of your life in the coming months.

But this isn't just about me. It's about you too.

It's an open secret that, over the past few years, pub companies and licensees haven't always seen eye to eye.

A fact reflected in the Government's Select Committee report on pub companies last year.

Now we take your concerns about regulation very seriously. And we've listened. That's why we've got self-regulation not central regulation.

But make no mistake. This is about you grasping the nettle.

I can see there have been a lot of improvements;

  * a strengthened industry code
  * greater transparency
  * a new arbitration and mediation service

All good work. But don't expect me to pat you on the back just yet.

Now's the time to make good on your promise. Go further. Go faster. Do what you need to do to convince the doubters things have changed.

You need to put your house in order. Otherwise you might find the dead hand of Whitehall feeling your collar.

Now I started out by saying pubs are at the heart of local communities. I'd like to finish with a nod to our work on community pubs.

In the past few years we've seen local people coming forward to save their local.

The Rookhope Inn in Weardale was rescued by Sunderland-based charity St Aidan's Community Trust.

When the town of Hesket Newmarket faced losing their local, they didn't get bitter, they got bolder.

Now they are running it themselves.

My Cabinet colleague William Hague is one of almost 200 members to have rescued the only pub in the small North Yorkshire village of Hudswell.

  * [Hudswell community pub - transcript](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/newsroom/word/1867361.doc)

MS Word, 25 kb, 2 pages

In my constituency a couple of pals didn't save a pub. They built a brewery.

The founders of the Brentwood Brewing Company said:

> ""We tasted a pint, thought that's not brilliant - we can do better than this!""

But Community Right to Bid means help is on tap. It requires local authorities to keep a record of their valuable community assets.

When they come up for sale, the community can call for a six month time out.

Prepare a bid.

Organise a whip round.

And save their pub from extinction.

But let's be honest. Saving a pub is one thing. Running it is something else.

The community spirited pub owner can often find themselves dealing less with a going concern. Than a growing concern. Once the scales fall from their eyes they find themselves facing more bureaucratic barriers than an Olympic hurdler.

Over the past couple of years we've had what we've called, in Government circles, the Red Tape Challenge.

This is starting to make headway in hacking through a forest of regulation, for example, in regard to the hospitality industry. Some of which will clearly have a bearing on you.

But in the coming months we will also be casting our eye over the community pub sector to see if there are other areas where we can wield the red tape axe.

We need to make sure folk with a bit of get up and go don't have all their enthusiasm watered down by a ministry of meddlers.

So we're taking action to help the pub industry. Helping those who run community pubs.

Acting because pubs and brewing play a unique role in our lives. They are part of the warp and woof of our country.

And we're determined to make sure they remain at the heart of our nation long into our future.

_Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version._

Thank you for, once again, inviting me to speak at your annual conference. So much has happened in the last twelve months and I am privileged to have the opportunity to update you today on what we have been doing.

## Creating markets to support the growth agenda

The waste industry plays an important role in promoting local - and green - growth. Last year, local authority waste management contributed around £3.3 billion. This is a significant sum of money and its impact on the British economy should not be underestimated.

But it is not just an important growth industry, it is a vital service. Millions of people rely on it to take away their daily build up household waste.

It is the one service people know they get for their £120 a month in council tax. We can't lose sight of that. The vast majority of people are grateful for that service.

Much of this is down to people in this room and I would like to thank you all for your contribution. Without it this country would be a lot less pleasant a place to live.

## Localism

Many of the changes we have brought about in the last year are evidence of localism in action. We are giving local authorities and their residents a greater say in how their rubbish and recycling services are delivered.

We have brought about a 360 degree turn in how waste collections are thought about. Instead of a crime and punishment approach we want a system that focuses on the best possible service. Where it is easier for the council and the householders to do the right thing.

Where councils promote rewards and incentives, new technology, more joint working and better procurement, to support weekly rubbish and recycling collections.

We are supporting that aim by consigning bin taxes to the dustbin of history.

Since the start of the year no council can charge families - the people they serve - for overfilling their bin or introduce extra tariffs for taking away household waste. Pay as you throw is not the right way to improve collections.

Fortnightly collections are unpopular and unhygienic.

It's the traditional weekly bin round that people want to see. We have got rid of the Audit Commission guidance that started the shift to fortnightly pick ups. Councils will no longer be marked down for offering that service.

To help with the transition back to weekly collections we have put £250 million on the table through our Weekly Collection Support Scheme so that councils can reinstate, or retain weekly waste collections, alongside improving environmental benefits like improved recycling rates or greater cost effectiveness.

Householders will no longer face the threat of a £1,000 fine or a criminal conviction for mistakenly putting a yogurt pot in the wrong bin or leaving it out a little too long.

This Government knows that bin fines were the wrong way to go. So they are being abolished. Step one was to reduce the level of the fine to an acceptable level. It was ridiculous that someone who made a simple mistake like putting something in the wrong bin could be fined more than a shoplifter.

Next we will introduce a 'harm to local amenity' test so appropriate action can be taken against fly-tippers and consistent offenders, but not ordinary householders.

Localism is integral to boosting recycling and improving waste management, because it is about strengthened local accountability.

At the heart of our agenda, is the wish to see citizens able to hold their councils to account, for the services that they receive.

The Localism Act supports investment in infrastructure and recognises the pivotal role planning contributes to delivering and maintaining appropriate and effective waste facilities. We have made it easier for citizens to engage with and shape the impact of planning decisions in their local area.

This will help them engage more constructively on where to locate waste facilities.

## Weekly Collection Support Scheme

We launched our Weekly Collection Support Scheme in February this year.

The bids we have received show that there is significant scope for councils to increase recycling rates and improve a frontline service without cutting the frequency of collections.

As you know outline bids had to be sent in by last month and I am pleased to say that we received 166 bids. More than many people expected. There are a range of proposals including infrastructure projects and incentive schemes.

We are getting ready to give those bidders bespoke feedback later this month.

This will help local authorities as they seek to finalise and improve their bids in time for the final bids deadline of 17 August 2012.

In so many areas local authorities have ignored their residents' needs and chosen to cut bin collections; this Scheme encourages local authorities to keep householder interests at the heart of their waste collection service, where they belong.

Any savings must also lead to service improvements otherwise councils are just getting paid to provide a worse service. It will let councils make decisions for their people not their budgets. This is the principle at the heart of localism. Serve the people, rather than the Government.

Sutton Borough Council get this. They are listening. They consulted their local people through open houses and an online forum on the quality, frequency, and costs of bin collections as part of a drive to save a million pounds, or 25 per cent of their waste budget.

As a result Sutton is renewing its commitment to weekly collections of household waste. They found the savings by using new technology to improve collection routes that allowed them more flexible shift patterns.

Local authorities and their residents deserve to choose the service that they receive.

Councils have chosen to bid and I am delighted that so many have taken up the offer.

We have not prescribed how councils go about delivering a weekly collection service, but will favour councils being innovative or tailoring their services to local needs. There is no 'one size fits all' solution to a good, high quality waste collection service. They need to be bespoke. To fit each specific circumstance.

We are also making the money easily available: successful bidders can choose a 'one off payment' or spread it over (up to) three years.

Innovative councils will also embrace this opportunity to invest in more sustainable waste management options - such as increased recycling and smarter procurement deals.

For example, Sandwell has kept a weekly bin collection service and, at the same time, taken huge steps to boost recycling. Their partnership with Serco means that by 2020 Sandwell will be recycling or composting at least 60 per cent of household rubbish. The majority of the remainder will be turned into renewable energy leaving less than five per cent going to expensive landfill.

Thanks to increased recycling, an estimated £300 million savings will be made over 25 years.

And Portsmouth City Council are working with Biffa Waste Services to deliver weekly pick ups to over 200,000 residents in the city.

They'll save £1 million per year, reduce CO2 emissions and have new software technology.

Other local authorities should learn from this and use the Scheme to develop new, better, ways of working.

## Partnership Proposals

Lord Taylor spoke about the importance of partnership working yesterday and I would like to reiterate that message and highlight the importance of public-private partnerships.

The close co-operation of local authorities and industry with local communities will help find the right solution for each place that puts the householder at the centre of the service while meeting our recycling targets and providing even greater value for money for the council tax payer.

## Planning

I've already touched briefly on planning. It goes hand in hand with localism. Planning plays a pivotal role in delivering new waste management facilities that improve services and help move waste up the waste hierarchy. But, as I said, they can be very unpopular neighbours.

As you will know, we did not think that the previous planning system was working. It was too adversarial and too complex. And too few plans were coming forward. That is why we are reforming the planning system.

It is important local people see the direct benefits of the facilities needed to provide the waste services that they want. So that rather than having to go through the courts trying to impose on them, as was done before, communities will welcome them.

Together the Localism Act and the National Planning Policy Framework are reinforcing our localist approach. Decisions are being taken by those who know their areas best. It firmly places communities at the heart of decision making. It decentralises the power and responsibility to shape places out of Whitehall.

It also enshrines the Local Plan and confirms that planning should focus on local needs, empowering local people to shape their surroundings, setting out a positive vision for the future of their area.

And whilst there is a transition period of 12 months for those local authorities that have recently adopted a Local Plan, my advice to all councils is to press ahead and ensure they have an up-to-date plan in place at the earliest opportunity.

## Influencing behaviours

We want to see more householders recycling. We don't want them to live in fear of being caught accidentally doing the wrong thing or feeling like they have been coerced into recycling. We want to enable residents to make well-informed decisions and choose to recycle. We want them to understand the benefits that recycling brings - both environmental and economic.

Reward schemes like Recyclebank and Local Green Points are already being successfully used to encourage residents to increase recycling rates and reduce the amount of waste householders send to landfill.

For years many of you in the waste industry have been trying to shift the attitudes of the rest of us; to try to get people to see waste as a resource, something valuable, not just something to be thrown away. These schemes are getting that message through to people in a far more tangible way than we've seen before.

They bring a real benefit to householders who participate in local recycling schemes. Finally, residents are beginning to cotton on to the value of what they are putting into their bin.

When people see a price tag they are going to stop and think about which bin they are going to use.

These schemes not only educate people, they enable them to make an informed decision to recycle as much as possible. Given the right promotion these incentive schemes can bring householders along with you, rather than leaving them lagging behind. We need to see more of them.

## Conclusion

Localism, the planning system and waste management can work hand in hand to put householders at the centre of waste collection services. The Government is dedicated to promoting these things.

We are doing our bit to help reshape the playing field around the principle of better service. Councils can once again think about how to offer a good weekly collection, improve recycling rates and reduce the amount of waste they send to landfill.

People will instinctively choose to do the right thing and recycle more if we make it a positive experience for them.

Let's keep working together to make that happen and give them the best possible waste service.

_Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version._

I would like to say how delighted I am to be invited to speak to this Summit - an event that grows in importance every year.

I am particularly pleased that the Summit brings together all parts of the fire industry - not only those who deliver the fire and rescue service at the sharp end, but all those who, often behind the scenes, do so much to ensure the buildings we live in and the products we use on a daily basis, are safe.

### A success story

And in terms of fires you should all congratulate yourselves on a considerable success story. In England, fire fatalities and non-fatal casualties fell by 34 per cent and 54 per cent respectively between 2001-02 and 2011-12, and the average area of fire damage fell by 20 per cent in dwellings and around 10 per cent in other buildings during the same period. Last year, total fires fell by 6 per cent to 227,000. I very much hope that these trends continue way into the future.

As part of Government's commitment to maintaining a high profile focus on prevention activity, the Fire Kills campaign is currently running its hugely successful national advertising campaign. As with last year, we are encouraging everyone to test their smoke alarms when they change their clocks this weekend as you are four times more likely to die in a fire if you do not have a working smoke alarm. I would ask that in order to extend the reach and breadth of the campaign, you use your own websites to disseminate this important message. By working together we have the opportunity to really drive home the importance of fire safe behaviour and maintain the downward trend on fire deaths.

The interaction between the fire industry and fire and rescue is a complex one - and for that reason I am delighted that the Fire Sector Federation is playing an increasingly important role in pulling all parts of the fire industry together, into a forum where ideas and knowledge can be exchanged. And I would particularly like to thank Brian Robinson, the Chairman of the Federation, for his hard work and perseverance in bringing the Federation to life.

### The importance of co-operation

Growth is a top priority for this Government. Supporting business growth for both new and existing companies is fundamental to our approach. And encouraging the creation of new businesses and sectors is crucial to this country's future. These new businesses will help to create the necessary wealth and growth, and much needed jobs. But we need also to ensure that both new and existing businesses are strong and resilient, including safeguarding and protecting them from the devastating effects of a fire.

All of you here today will know, a fire can result in a business loss both in terms of its employees, its contribution to the local economy, and ability to recover and trade again in the aftermath of an incident.

I urge the fire sector to go out and proactively engage with representative bodies for industry and commerce and make the case for effective and proportionate fire protection - passive and active interventions - in all areas of business in England.

### False alarms

The industry also has a vitally important role to play in ensuring that we make the best use of innovative technology. You will know better than me, the scope for technology to improve resilience to fire - but one area where more can be done is in limiting the number of false alarms. Last year there were 249,000 fire false alarms.

London Fire Brigade says that despite a reduction of 23 per cent in false alarms in the last five years, a fire engine is still called to a false alarm every 12 minutes in the capital, costing an estimated £34 million every year. More importantly, these unnecessary calls impact on the Brigade's ability to attend real incidents, deliver training and carry out vital community safety work.

I believe that technology can address this issue. To that end I have asked Brian Robinson to see what the industry itself can do to drive down false alarms through improved technology. Brian has asked a Fire Sector Federation working group under Martin Harvey to look into this issue - and I very much look forward to hearing their findings.

### Workforce development

Another area where I see significant improvement is in relation to workforce development in fire and rescue services. Here collaborative working between the Sector Skills Council - Skills for Fire and Rescue, and the Chief Fire Officers Association amongst others, is starting to produce tangible results, especially in the risk critical areas of intervention activity. Such work helps underpin Integrated Risk Management Plans, interoperability, national resilience and common working. Much energy is being devoted to this work. I would like to thank Max Hood, the chair of the National Occupational Committee for his efforts in leading this work.

### Public procurement

I know that many of you have an interest in public procurement and accessing new markets. This is an area where Government is keen to help. As you may know, the Government has put in place the Contracts Finder website, aimed at making it easier for suppliers to find and apply for public sector contracts. It is the main source of government opportunities worth more than £10,000.

My Department has already approached certain fire and rescue authorities to help populate pipelines and is very grateful for the assistance given to date. We are now asking all fire and rescue authorities for help to get as much information on future procurements in the pipeline - this should not be difficult as fire and rescue authorities should already be publishing this information existing contracts and tenders under the Local Government Transparency Code. The information on future procurements will help strengthen the UK Supply Chain by identifying current gaps between supply and demand and giving industry the confidence to invest for the future.

The Government is also committed to devolving power away from Whitehall so that fire and rescue authorities can decide how they can deliver services in a way that best meets their communities' needs. I hope that the fire sector can join together to develop new ways of working and further innovation that can stimulate growth for all.

### Youth employment

I want to speak a little about youth employment. In response to the challenge of youth unemployment, year the Deputy Prime Minister has launched a £1billion Youth Contract to help unemployed people get a job. The Youth Contract will provide a number of new opportunities for young people, including apprenticeships and work experience placements. Many of you will be aware of the The Prince's Trust Fire Industry Scheme, and some have supported it. I wish to thank you for that, and encourage others to get involved if they can.

I know a number of fire and rescue authorities have started training apprentices. I was particularly impressed to hear that in Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service 12 young people have started a community safety apprenticeship.

The apprentices are young people who have already had some contact with Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service, for example through the Prince's Trust courses, cadets and Fire Fly following a targeted recruitment campaign.

To support them through the application process, they put on a 10-day pre-recruitment course - run by Salford City College - to give candidates an understanding of working with people in the communities they would serve, as well as meeting a Community Safety Adviser who is already in the job, so they know exactly what the role entails.

I would like to commend Greater Manchester for this valuable initiative, and wish the new entrants every possible success in their apprenticeship, and future careers.

### Retained duty system firefighters

And finally, the one area where industry and the fire and rescue service co-operate on a daily, if not hourly basis, is in the retained duty system. There is no doubt that the retained duty system is the backbone of the fire and rescue response in large swathes of the United Kingdom. We must as leaders in the fire sector, where ever possible, bring to people's attention the valuable work done by retained duty firefighters, and encourage employers and members of the public to offer their services to this essential service.

Thank you.

_Transcript of the speech as delivered._

#### Introduction - working together

Thank you for that introduction.

Tonight I should like to speak briefly and specifically about how we can increase the supply of homes.

I do so, in one sense as the most dangerous type of Ministers (my civil servants will take that view!), namely someone who has a little knowledge of what he is talking about!

As a Chartered Surveyor, I feel I have some understanding of the housing and the construction markets. But I come to this role knowing that frankly I still have much to learn, particularly about the social housing sector.

So let me start by saying that I want to listen. The expertise when I look gathered here around the room is one I intend not to ignore. Indeed it's experience which I value. There will be times when we won't always agree, but if we work together, we can make a real difference.

#### Government's role

As a Government we are already setting the direction.

Last November, we established the Housing Strategy as our long term framework for future action.

In the Spring, we introduced a series of key policies, including for example New Buy, which has the capability of helping up to 100,000 people.

And just two weeks ago, a day after I was in post, we set out a comprehensive set of measures to accelerate progress. Those measures include:

  * Building up to another 15,000 new affordable homes and bringing an extra 5,000 empty homes back into use;
  * Putting an additional £280 million into FirstBuy - so around 27,000 will now be able to buy their first home; and
  * Confirming Government Guarantees of up to £10 billion, for the development of many more new rented homes.

Now, these guarantees in particular have the potential to galvanise the sector. And it shows that, despite inheriting an enormous deficit, this Government is absolutely committed to providing the policies and resources needed to build the homes people want.

These new measures build on the £1.3 billion that is already working to unlock stalled housing schemes, and the Affordable Homes Programme of £19.5 billion, which we are confident, will deliver up to 170,000 new affordable homes.

Taken together with our reforms to the planning system and the rented sectors, these policies represent the best way to improve our housing provision in both the short and longer term.

#### Challenge

But, tonight, if I may, I would also like to issue a challenge.

I said earlier that I value your collected expertise and capability. Many of the organisations represented here provide a wide range of innovative social housing, and good services to existing tenants.   But I think you can do more.

There's a great opportunity to use your experience to develop more homes and serving a much wider group of people.

Housing associations are after all good at tailoring services that respect very different housing needs. Affordable home ownership is a good example.

I've seen the work of London and Quadrant on the former Olympic Park where they are already developing affordable homes for both rent and purchase.

And just last week Thames Valley launched their Fizzy Living scheme to prospective private tenants.

So what I'd like to challenge you all to think about is how you can develop homes for a much wider group of people, in different ways, and perhaps in different tenures.

We will help, not least through our newly announced housing guarantees; and the £200 million equity finance fund, so take it from me that we want you to be bold.

#### Clarity and stability for sector

As a former businessman I do, however, understand that for you to be innovative, you need longer term certainty about the market you work in and the direction of government policy.

This is especially true when it comes to the future of finance for affordable homes and the specific direction of policy on rents and policy reaching beyond the current spending review period.

Now on this, my ninth working day in the job, I can't set out for you the full detail for the next three years. But let me be clear:

  * I understand why you need that certainty;
  * I intend to address this longer term framework;
  * I want to do so working with you and others so we get it right.

#### True value of social housing

As a former Business Minister, I also know about the economic value of your sector: the ability to drive local growth.

Most people understand the social role of housing, whether owned, or rented, whether private or public.

And I strongly believe that housing is not merely about bricks and mortar. All of us need a home, somewhere we can call our own, somewhere that families can be secure and where children can grow.

And I shall want to address those social issues, whether it is the scourge of neighbours from hell, or the plight of the homeless.

However, increasing the housing supply, especially of affordable homes, also has an important economic purpose. One in which you and the organisations you represent have a vital role.

Building affordable homes, when you look at the bare statistics, is a great economic multiplier - and your buying power can help sustain local businesses.

You also provide jobs and help tackle worklessness. Thousands of young people have benefited from apprenticeships with construction companies on affordable housing projects.

And let me also to say to you that it doesn't matter how small your organisation is.  Indeed many of the smaller organisations are at the cutting edge of community activism, successfully using the new community rights that this Government has introduced.

It's about giving local people a say as to what goes on in their community - whether that's deciding where new homes are built, or how affordable housing is managed, this role is really important.   

So, while the issue of building new affordable homes is clearly front and centre - I also want to say that I recognise the vital role you play in helping to protect the homeless, the vulnerable and the marginalised in society.

#### Conclusion

So, Ladies and Gentlemen, we're putting in place a comprehensive set of measures to help this sector adapt and grow.

Of course, there are significant challenges, but as a Government we are determined to work with you to address both the short term symptoms and the long term causes.

That's why we're:

  * Providing our multi billion pound guarantees to help lever in new investment;
  * Removing the planning and financial barriers that are holding back the housing market; and
  * Developing a clear direction to help increase the supply of all forms of housing, owned or rented, public or private.

I think the package really has the opportunity to make a real difference and I am looking forward to working with you.

Overcoming the problems before us won't be easy.  But then, nothing worthwhile ever is.

Thank you.

_Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version._

Those who know me will know I love India, a country I have visited many times. A country that inspires in me the same sort of awe that impelled a spellbound Mark Twain to write of:

> ""...that cradle of the human race, birthplace of human speech, mother of history, grandmother of legend, great-grandmother of traditions…
> 
> ""...the one land that all men desire to see, and having seen once, by even a glimpse, would not give that glimpse for the shows of all the rest of the world combined.""

But it is not merely India's great ancient spirit that captivates me. A spirit that has shaped the religious, literary and intellectual lives. Of billions of people, generation after generation. What beguiles me about India is its extraordinary vitality, its youthful exuberance. Unshackled by the past. Unwilling to build its future on the shifting sands of yesterday. It has eyes only for the future.

Indira Ghandi once said:

> ""There are two kinds of people. Those who do the work and those who take the credit.""

India has only ever been interested in being the former category. Only ever interested in listening to the drumbeat of ideas. The drumbeat of education. The drumbeat of innovation.

And everywhere you look in modern India today you will see new totems of progress. The airports in Bangalore and in Hyderabad. The Bandra-Worli Sea link in Mumbai. The metro in Delhi.

In Britain we are firmly set on the self-same sea of progress. Not far from here in East London the world is gripped by another sporting extravaganza. Wheelchairs revving. Blades buzzing. Paralympians like India's Girisha [Hosanagara Nagarajegowda], reaching Olympian heights and grabbing medals.

Yet a few years back there were no new sporting wonders of the world. No pristine park to entertain sporting royalty. Just 300 acres of deserted wasteland. It took British skill, British expertise, British ambition, to turn Stratford into a place fit to host the Olympian spirit.

And we're pressing on. Pushing progress as far as it will go. From the Thames estuary to the Atlantic gateway. Our Local Enterprise Partnerships now span England, creating new zones of economic influence, offering ever more internationally competitive technological readiness and business sophistication. Freezing business rates and relaxing planning rules to attract the investor's wandering eye.

So Britain and India are fellow travellers. Sharing the same desire to progress. The same entrepreneurial drive. The same ambition. And that's why we want to see our relationship blossom. Currently our trade relationship is worth £16.8billion a year. Fine for a partnership of economic convenience, but not for those of us who desire a marriage of ambition.

And were the genie to offer me two wishes, I would wish firstly to see more Indian businesses, more companies like Tata, coming over here to take advantage of one of the best business climates in the world. Making the most of the brands, the creativity and technology that only Britain has to offer

And secondly I would wish to see more Indian companies turning to British expertise to help feed that economic tiger. Turning Indian plans for $1trillion of investment in infrastructure into concrete reality.

Already our relationship is maturing. Exports to India were up 40 per cent last year, while UK companies announced £9billion of investment in India.

But forget those figures for a moment. For evidence of what our two great nations can achieve together you need only shift your gaze across the London skyline to the Olympic Park. Where a brave new steel sculpture soars above our grand new sporting amphitheatres. Those modern day wonders of the world.

At 377 feet, the ArcelorMittal Orbit is Britain's tallest sculpture. But it is also much more - designed by Anish Kapoor, funded by Lakshmi Mittal - it is a structure celebrating Anglo-Indian ingenuity. A symbol proudly proclaiming Britain and India's determination to reach for the stars. And a sign, above all, of marvellous things to come for our two great countries.

_Transcript of the speech as delivered._

### Introduction

I'm a great fan of local government. It is the quickest, fastest most adaptable part of our constitution.

We do live in challenging times. Our country has been left an unsustainable budget deficit and we're facing the shocks everyday of our dear friends in the Eurozone.

> ""Local government is the quickest most adaptable part of our constitution.""

Yet, at every stage, councils have shown their ability to adapt to changing conditions and to just simply get the job done.

This was true for the riots last summer - where councils played a pivotal role helping families and businesses rebuild their lives.

The same is true for the recent flash floods in the Pennines. Local services worked through the night to clear debris, monitor river levels and operate flood defences at numerous locations. But just let one community speak for all of them. In Crawshawbooth, in the centre of the Pennines, residents coming out in the early morning to clean the way so the Olympic Torch could pass with pride 12 hours later.

This civic pride was true for councils taking steps to help hard-working families and pensioners with the cost of living.

Local councils overwhelmingly took up the offer of a second council tax freeze this year, delivering real terms cuts for family bills.

It was also true for troubled families.

You're taking the responsibility to turn around the lives of 120,000 troubled families in double-quick time.

We now have every principal authority across England ready to run programmes in their areas. And that is three or four months in advance of what people thought was possible.

It will help get more kids off the streets and into schools, cut youth crime, as well as putting parents on a path back to work.

So local government has shown its capacity and capability to respond when the situation demands. And in recent days we've had a further example with the response to the tragic explosion in Oldham.

And I know there is a fantastic demand and an ambition to do more, particularly in the field of economic development and pooling of public budgets.

### Powers and freedoms for councils

Last year we passed the Localism Act.

Royal Assent was just the beginning of the process not the end.

> ""The next stage of localism demands that local government takes the lead and grabs power. So don't wait for permission...""

The challenge is implementing the new policies and new powers, and working with communities to help them use these new rights and responsibilities.

The Act's general power of competence is already being used up and down the country every day of the week.

Yet the power of competence gives you the power to innovate and transform.

We scrapped a lot of the mindless bureaucracy, the excessive form-fillings, the clip board culture, that really blighted your lives.

  * Comprehensive Area Assessment - gone
  * Local Area Agreements - gone
  * and we will continue via the Single Data List to scale back Whitehall's unrelenting and unreasonable data reporting demands

We practice what we preach in cutting unnecessary tiers of bureaucracy.

Across my own Department, we are cutting our running costs by 42 per cent.

We've abolished a range of quangos - the likes of the Government Offices for the Regions, to the Tenants Services Authority have now all closed their doors.

And we localised a number more - such as returning Development Corporations back to local government, and handing fire procurement back to the sector.

On Sunday, we finally wave goodbye to the Standards Board regime.

A regime which harmed the reputation of local government. That suppressed freedom of speech and was ineffectual by any measure.

In its place, at its heart, will be local transparency, backed up by criminal sanctions to tackle the genuinely rare cases of corruption in local government.

I can announce today that the transparency regime will include councillors being asked to declare their donations and payments in kind from trade unions.

There is legitimate public concern that if councils are bankrolling trade union pilgrims, they've a right to know who's bankrolling the councillors.

The Standards Board won't be missed.

Neither will the Audit Commission.

When I spoke to you a while ago, I said scrapping the Commission would save £50million a year.

I'm sorry.

I got it completely wrong.

It will actually not save anything like it.

It will actually save £650million over the next five years - with local government keeping the bulk of those savings.

Now it's not just in local governance that we're cutting red tape.

The planning reform is part of that process of reducing unnecessary bureaucracy and devolving power.

It's also a vital driver for growth.

The national planning guidance is now 50 pages, not 1,000 as it previously was.

We are going to do more - such as scaling back thousands more pages of underlying guidance, and implementing the Penfold Review to remove duplicate consent regimes.

This is fundamentally empowering for local councillors - no longer should the process be the preserve of the planning lawyer or NGOs.

Our reforms place a far a greater importance on councils drawing up their Local Plans.

Of course that will be a challenge.

It will mean choices, balancing business growth and the need for more housing, and at the same time, protecting the environment.

In due course, our aim is there won't be Regional Spatial Strategies to hide behind and blame.

But this will be a great opportunity to do what you came into local government to do. To shape, to improve your community.

However, we can't tackle red tape without taking on the bureaucrats from Brussels.

Previous governments have used Brussels directives to piggy-back their pet projects and pretend they've come from over the water.

We need to take out EU gold-plating, from the Kafkaesque procurement regulations to the ERDF regulations which are more obsessed with flying the EU flag than offering value for money.

We live in a fiscal environment where it's all about delivering more for less. We've gone well beyond the need for better value for money.

### Money

Local government accounts for a quarter of all public spending.

Councils have been at the forefront in the last two years in delivering sensible savings whilst protecting the frontline. And you deserve enormous credit for that.

Many central government departments and quangos are now delivering their part of those savings.

To the Siren voices who think we should continue to borrow and spend without restraint, just look at nations on the rocks - nations such as Greece or Italy.

Their failure to tackle their deficits and command the confidence of the markets has resulted in bigger spending cuts being required - much bigger spending cuts in their local government sectors.

By contrast, in Britain, we have already reduced the nation borrowing by more than a quarter of the nation's budget deficit, and interest rates are at a record low, keeping mortgage payments down and helping families with their cost of living.

Local government still spent £118billion in year to April.

New figures today show that capital spending on construction hit a record £14.8billion - the highest level ever.

Of course, eyes are rightly turning to the next Spending Review, as the Local Government Association highlighted earlier this week.

The LGA's message on social care pressures was a powerful one.

I'm sure it strikes a chord with many of us because the decisions we're about to take on social care are probably among the biggest ones you and I are going to take in our lives.

And it's right that it should be at the centre of the Spending Review.

The LGA also highlighted the rising cost of waste.

Waste collection is a perfect example of the dilemmas that councils face in trying to make savings, whilst still providing quality services to their residents.

But it is also a case study in how savings can be made through better procurement, more joint working, incentives and new technology.

Now the last Government actively encouraged councils to make cuts to collections, issue heavy-handed fines and impose new taxes on families.

My department's Weekly Collection Support Scheme is showing there is a different way, whilst still being consistent with the principles of localism.

Last Friday, marked the end of the Outline Bidding Stage. And we have received 166 different bids, in total £430million of funding (for a quarter of a billion pound scheme).

I think it proves my point - that there is massive enthusiasm for better ways of working. For focusing on the service to the customer: the local taxpayer.

### Sensible savings

Now as part of the LGA's response, I looked endlessly at the 'Graph of Doom' analysis that assumes in 20 years we'll be in a difficult position.

A Malthusian crisis in local government.

Yet councils are not passive players. They've already shown this capability of adapting.

Whether it's by collaborating and sharing resources, to reduce in-house management and overhead costs. Or by using technology to improve your services.

The Tri-borough initiative in London is on track to save £40million a year by combining services and management costs. If other authorities simply copied this example, councils could potentially save up to a further £2billion.

I want to know what central government can do to remove obstacles to more joint working and pooling of staff and resources.

For example, I'm already looking into representations made by local government colleagues into what we can do to make it easier to remove chief executive posts, without having to hand out massive payoffs.

But I can't wait to hear the reports of our 14 Community Budget pilots - from Cheshire to Essex on Whole Place and from Bradford Trident to Haverhill on neighbourhoods - pioneering new ways of delivering efficient services and greater local control by joining up funding streams.

Early research shows that a saving of as little as a two per cent equates to over £1billion. This could well be the model for the future.

As John Cridland said to you yesterday, there is still more we can do to improve procurement and share services. This is true for Whitehall and town halls.

Councils are spending £60billion a year procuring goods and services.

The LGA's own programme on collaborative procurement has identified savings of up to 20 per cent in some service areas.

Now my own Department is sharing estates, audit, security and moving other organisations into our head office.

My department's Capital and Asset Pathfinder shows a cross-public sector approach that can lead to savings again of up to 20 per cent.

Now the sheer act of publishing property asset registers online has been an enormous wake up call for many of us in the public sector.

There is no better way of securing our essential services and guaranteeing their quality than transparency.

Indeed, since my department started publishing every single penny of Government Procurement Card spending online, we've been able to cut spending on these corporate credit cards by three-quarters.

The over-use of these flexible friends represents a most massive reputational risk to the public sector.

The sunlight of transparency is the way forward.

Transparency and better procurement complement each other - initiatives like ContractFinder allow you to open up your tenders to a wider audience, especially small firms, and drive down costs at the same time.

I believe the nation's fiscal challenge present us with real opportunities for those with quite a bit of imagination.

Now this week, the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead announced they are to give Nectar points to residents signing up to paying their council tax bills electronically by direct debit.

Something which councils have been trying to encourage for years. Yet innovation and technology can save money for both taxpayer and the council.

My department will be doing our bit, by amending the regulations which hinder electronic billing.

The National Fraud Authority has estimated that councils lose £2 billion a year which could be reduced by cracking down on fraud and improving their prevention, detection and recovery of fraud. So the Local Government Finance Bill is going to increase Councils' incentives to tackle fraud.

### Go for growth

That Local Government Finance Bill is decentralisation, enterprise and promoting economic growth.

> ""Local government remains the friend of progress.""

We know the existing system which prevented councils from retaining their business rates encouraged a begging bowl mentality. So many town halls tried to accentuate the negative, eliminate the positive and definitely messed with Mr In-between.

It was frustrating to see places, many in the North, growing faster than the national average without any reward.

The Bill represents the biggest shake-up to town hall finance in a generation.

By enabling councils to keep 50 per cent of their business rate growth, it will create a new incentive for local government across England to support growth by making your own decisions about local firms and local jobs.

What's more, by having a steady income stream the new rates enable you to borrow against future growth so you can spend more on vital public infrastructure.

We estimate these reforms could boost the economy by £10billion.

I anticipate there will be a massive demand in local government for more. So we will have to balance the need to pay off the nation's budget deficit and also to support deprived and vulnerable councils.

So we're allowing you to keep the proceeds of growth but we're also making sure we give local people the means to create business and jobs. Government can't create jobs from the centre.

You are far better placed to help drive that growth in your local areas. So we've helped you to get on with it through local planning, unringfencing billions of pounds of government grant and through our City Deals - transferring powers to our urban areas. And we will be announcing a full package of City Deals very shortly.

Tax Increment Financing will help lever in new infrastructure, more jobs and more new homes.

Once again you've delivered. We've now got 39 Local Enterprise Partnerships with local businesses covering the whole country.

The South East Local Enterprise Partnership has already identified over 10 projects to receive £38million of Growing Places Fund to create 26,000 jobs and 17,000 new homes.

While Coventry and Warwickshire's Partnership pledged to create 100 apprenticeships in 100 days. And they exceeded their target.

These Partnerships are complemented by our 24 Enterprise Zones.

Now up and running, they are beginning to bring in the business.

Whether it's in Tees Valley - where Omega Plastics and Propipe Limited have moved into units at Hartlepool's Queens Meadow Business Park.

Or in Daresbury - where technology companies are joining their high tech counterparts by moving into Vanguard House, the first Enterprise Zone development at the campus.

These local starts are quickly gaining international recognition.

The Japanese logistics firm Vantec, a subsidiary of Nissan, became the first overseas company to invest £24million in an Enterprise Zone - taking advantage of Sunderland's Enhanced Capital Allowances.

Diamond firm Elements Six is pumping millions into the world's largest synthetic super-materials research and development facility in Science Vale Harwell in Oxfordshire's Enterprise Zone.

And, in the Liverpool area, on the site of the International Trade Centre at Wirral Waters, they've just secured £200million of Chinese investment.

### Conclusion

So this year, since the last LGA conference, has been a year of delivery.

You've adapted.

You're starting to use the new powers and freedoms you now have.

And you've delivered on the ground.

And that's really the point.

Localism relies on local people and local action.

So be bold, be brave, be pushy.

The next stage of localism demands that local government takes the lead and grabs power.

So don't wait for permission - if you do it will almost certainly be too late.

Push until we try to stop you.

Local government remains the friend of progress.

It's the quickest most adaptable part of our constitution.

You, my friends, can deliver for the nation.

In four days time we'll be handing the Olympic flame onto Brazil. But when it leaves, the flame of opportunity, the flame of capability and the flame of progress will remain in the UK. And will continue to burn brightly in this magnificent city of London.

![iframe: ](https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XUawrRfqw_I?start=74;rel=0;showinfo=0)

Over in the Olympic Park are seven new arenas. Seven venues that are cause for wonder - cause for celebration. Not just because they were completed on time and under budget. But because they will enjoy a new lease of life once the Games is over. Either as a sporting venue here or - taken down and reassembled - in another corner of the globe.

And there is an eighth wonder too - the Olympic Park itself. A once barren wasteland brought to full bloom. A place thousands will soon call home. Close by Europe's largest shopping centre. Near the site of a new tech city that will rival Silicon Valley. Crisscrossed by new bridges bringing communities together, and intersected by railway lines linking major business districts to more local people.

Now the spark that lit up the Olympic park has ignited a wildfire of creativity. Spreading eastwards. Illuminating the Thames Gateway. From the new development at South End Airport to the high speed manufacturing plant in Dagenham. From the Enterprise Zone in the fertile heart of the Royal Docks to the revitalised towns of Strand East, Canning Town and Woolwich Central.

It's a transformation that calls to mind a verse from John Dryden, the greatest poet of his day, who more than 300 years ago watched a different London rise like a Phoenix from the embers of a Great Fire that had laid waste to his precious city. And inspired wrote:

> ""Already from this chymic flame
> 
> ""I see a city of more precious mould,
> 
> ""Rich as the town which gives the Indies name,
> 
> ""With silver paved and all divine with gold.""

So there is massive opportunity here to grasp the torch of investment, and to, in the words of John (Armitt not Dryden):

> ""Stretch the moment.""

And, for would be backers, Britain is an investors dream:

  * the easiest place to do business anywhere in Europe;
  * the lowest business tax rates available anywhere in any advanced country;
  * home to the world's best universities;
  * birthplace of the language of business - English.

And it's not like the old days when London was the only town in the game. Growth is spreading its wings right across the country.

We've Local Enterprise Partnerships - local business and local authorities - competing to be the best areas for inward investment.

And we've Enterprise Zones - relaxing planning rules, offering reduced business rates to encourage new investment.

Above all we've got brilliant British construction companies you can partner with. And, if the Olympic Park is a monument to anything it is a monument to their fantastic endeavour.

More than 1600 firms from up and down the land, the cream of our national construction, engineering, architectural and design talent, built 98 per cent of the Park.

They brought us the technical wonder of the Olympic Stadium, with a third of the steel of Beijing's 'Bird's Nest'.

They produced an Olympic Village with the largest grouping of sustainable quality homes anywhere in the country.

They created the remarkable Energy Centre at the Olympic park - a renovated Edwardian sweet factory - whose innovative biomass boilers not only heat every single venue and build in the park at a radically reduced cost to the environment, but will, long after the Games, power new buildings and new communities.

And this well-spring of construction talent is unlikely to run dry any time soon, because to get the Park and village built we trained an army. Of the 46,000 people to have worked on the Olympic Park and Olympic Village, 10 per cent were previously unemployed. We gave them the skills they needed to complete Europe's largest construction project.  
   
And soon the Olympic Park will play host to new universities and new technical institutions so that our British production line will be fed by an inexhaustible tributary of talent far into the future.

Now we're mightily proud of every single one of the construction companies who poured their talent and their time into making these such a fantastic Games. They are true Olympic heroes. And once the Games are over we'll be looking for every opportunity for them to blow their own trumpets.

So these are great days to get in on the British shop floor. Days when we might say as Dryden once said:

> ""The venturous merchant who designed more far,
> 
> ""And touches on our hospitable shore,
> 
> ""Charmed with the splendour of this northern star
> 
> ""Shall here unlade him and depart no more.""

And our would-be investors have still to feast on the possibilities of what's to come

  * Crossrail - Uniting the commercial might of West London with the growing power in the East of the city; and
  * High Speed 2 - The most ambitious national rail project this country has ever seen. Bringing the rest of the country closer than ever to the capital, and to our European and international gateways.

But this isn't just about what you can do for us. It's about what we can do for you. As the Chief Executive* of one large construction company remarked not so long ago:

> ""The Olympics is a fantastic global shop window for British management expertise, design and construction skills, and that expertise can be exported to make other games equally impressive.""

He's spot on.

The one-time owner of our splendid venue today, The Duke of Sutherland, was known as the 'Leviathan of wealth'. And today in our British construction industry there is a new Leviathan; of know-how, of talent, of confidence. Undaunted by the most enormous of tasks, in the shape of its life, charged up and ready to deliver. Any place, any time, anywhere.

So we're looking ahead to see how we can pass the flame of our experience onto Sochi, host city of the next Winter Olympic Games. Onto Brazil, and beyond that onto Korea and Qatar.

And four days from now, when the curtain comes down on the greatest Games ever hosted, we won't feel sad. We will feel excited for there are great days ahead for Great Britain.

_Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version._

### Introduction

I am delighted to be here today in my second full week in my new job. I'd like congratulate Vij (Randeniya) on his election as the new CFOA President and thank Lee (Howell) for all his work as part of the presidential team.

I would like to put on record my thanks to fire and rescue authorities for the important role they played in torch relays across the United Kingdom and during the Olympic and Paralympics Games.

Although the role that fire and rescue authorities played has gone almost unnoticed in the public eye, the effort and resources which were put in place were greatly appreciated across Government. I am pleased that a number of fire and rescue authority staff who made a significant contribution in delivery of services will be receiving recognition in the form of a commemorative medallion.

I'd also like to play tribute to Bob Neill, who I know had a deep understanding of the issues you face, a huge knowledge of the sector, and who worked closely with you on resetting the relationship between central and local government, devolving power and responsibility to the front line professionals, to communities and their local elected representatives - where it rightly sits.

I am very pleased to have been given this brief and I look forward to working with you and your elected members in the coming weeks, months and, hopefully, years. I'm particularly pleased to say that my new brief maintains the link between fire and rescue and local government. Alongside my fire responsibilities I am also local government Minister. This is particularly important to me as I am a keen proponent of local determination on service delivery, on prioritisation and on spending decisions. Keeping the fire and local government link is vital in this and I am sure you will be pleased to hear that I intend to continue Bob's good work here, embedding localism, continuing the integration of funding via the business rates system, and more importantly, getting out of the way to let you do what you do best.

### Fire Prevention

We will of course, continue to support you where it is appropriate. Thankfully, the number of fires and associated fatalities and injuries continue to fall. The latest statistics show fire deaths in the home have more than halved in the last twenty years - and fell 12 per cent last year.

This is a fantastic achievement and the Fire Kills campaign is a great example of how effective a partnership between Government and local fire and rescue authorities can be. The campaign's annual report for 2011/12 was published last week. It clearly demonstrates the range and impact of fire prevention activity being delivered by both the Department through its media campaign, and by its partners. The outstanding success of this campaign is, as you know, in large part due to the sterling, and often innovative, work undertaken at the local level to embed its fire safety messages with both the general public, and with those who may be especially vulnerable to the risks from fire.

Ultimately, the commitment of you and your local partners to the prevention agenda saves lives and resources. It ensures that our communities are safer places, less exposed to the destruction and devastation caused by fire.

The challenge must now be to maintain that clear focus on fire prevention, community safety and resilience. Working together allows us to deliver consistent safety messages, tailoring and targeting the campaign to maximise its effectiveness at the local level.

Next month, the Fire Kills campaign will again be running the hugely successful national advertising campaign to encourage everyone to test that their smoke alarms are working when changing their clocks. I'm sure you'll already be considering how best to support this at the local level.

By working together we have the opportunity to really drive home the importance of fire safe behaviour and maintain the downward trend on fire deaths. Given its impact, I am committed to maintaining a high profile focus on community fire prevention and safety activity.

### Resilience

Prevention activity doesn't just relate to improving fire safety. We have a model for civil contingency delivery that fits with our views of localism: planning and action at local level based on local risks and with partners having local accountability to make your localities more resilient places.

I know fire and rescue authorities are increasingly providing strategic leadership to local multi-agency emergency planning activity, with Chief Fire Officers chairing four of England's 38 local resilience forums.

This means fire and rescue authorities working with partners locally to better identify and mitigate complex resilience risks that could disrupt everyday life; including flooding, severe winter weather, disruption to fuel supplies or security threats. I hope, as I'm sure you do, that your role in responding to these types of emergencies is not called upon. But in my role as Minister for fire, resilience and emergencies I am keen to hear more about the good examples of the role of fire and rescue authorities in local multi-agency planning that strengthens our ability to quickly respond and recover from disruptive events.

### A clear vision for local delivery - The National Framework

At the very heart of the Government's ambition is putting power back where it belongs - in communities and with the locally elected councilors who represent them.

Fire and rescue authorities have been empowered with greater freedoms and flexibilities. You now have general powers of competence and an equivalent general power along with the ability to consult locally to allow charging for additional activities including the option for charging for persistent false reports. These are good examples of central Government stepping back and letting you get on with your job.

The Fire and Rescue National Framework is currently proceeding through parliament, and will be fully in force in October this year. I've come to it new. But I like what I see. For me, it embodies the right approach; setting high level principles instead of detailed requirements - it's 'what' not 'how'. I am pleased to hear that CFOA has welcomed this document. I would also like to thank you for the support and advice I understand you gave to officials as part of the working group. I think we should all be proud of the Framework, one that moves away from prescription to empowerment, and one that clearly sets out three bold priorities for fire and rescue authorities to:

  * identify and assess the full range of foreseeable fire and rescue related risks their areas face, make provision for prevention and protection activities and respond to incidents appropriately
  * work in partnership with their communities and a wide range of partners locally and nationally to deliver their service; and
  * be accountable to communities for the service they provide.

It goes without saying that this includes the business community. I firmly believe that businesses have the right to expect that those enforcing regulatory compliance do so in accordance with the fundamental principles of better regulation. I know that CFOA are keen to address shortcomings in this area and to lead work at the local level to develop fire safety audit and enforcement responsibilities to reflect more closely the aspirations that businesses have. Essentially, this means for helpful, proportionate and consistent advice on compliance.

Given that economic growth and business support is our number one priority, I commend you for your approach and look forward to a positive progression of this significant tranche of work.

Our national resilience to major fire and rescue related risks remains a priority for government. But we can only do this together, through true partnership, working across all local and national responders.

That is why we have put in place the Fire and Rescue Strategic Resilience Board, and it is already bringing key partners together to consider national resilience issues. Of course, government will continue to set the strategic direction, but our approach to national resilience must be based on and drawn from local capability alongside your professional expertise.

We can only prepare effectively if we have an approach to resilience based on local expertise and knowledge. Communities rightly expect their local fire and rescue authorities to play their part in keeping the country safe; every major emergency originates as a local emergency and being able to plan effectively for all incidents and emergencies, irrespective of whether they are of a local, cross-border or national nature, is essential.   
In delivering for your communities, you need to engage them - give them a real understanding of the risks being faced and the full range of what you are doing so they can better understand why you make the decisions you do.

We all know there are some increasingly tough decisions to be made on how best to allocate prevention, protection and operational resources locally - this needs to be done in a way that meets community aspirations in an open and consultative way.

By giving communities a voice, you give them a choice:

  * choice to make their views known on whether their priorities are the same as yours
  * choice to come up with new ideas on service provision; and
  * choice to challenge you on these issues.

Going further, we are today launching a  consultation on assurance statements, a mechanism for showing the public how the services they provide are run by their authorities. I know that some of you have mixed feelings on such statements. But for me this is about demonstrating a commitment to greater openness, showing the taxpayer how their money (including council tax) is spent, enabling communities to hold their authorities to account over how they spend the public's money and for the decisions that they make. And some of you are already doing it very well. Every aspect of council business - including the decisions they make for the delivery of fire and rescue - should be open to public scrutiny including senior pay, councillor expenses and local services.

### Economic context

I am of course mindful of the financial backdrop we all face. We have taken tough decisions necessary to reduce the budget deficit that we inherited from the last administration. Every bit of the public sector needs to do its bit to help, and local government accounts for a quarter of the public sector.

I value the incredibly important service that fire and rescue authorities deliver for local communities, and the part they play in national resilience. Despite the need to cut the national deficit, fire and rescue, as a frontline emergency service, has been given funding protection with reductions back-loaded to give more time for sensible savings to be made and reductions applied to fire and rescue authorities have been less than those applied to local authorities in general.

You will know that we are currently consulting upon plans for 2013-15 funding as part of the business rates retention scheme - this consultation is due to close on the 24th of September and I know that many of you have already engaged in the process. I would urge those whose voices have not yet been heard to ensure they make their views known.

I know that you are anxious to see what funding might look like from 2013, but I'm sure you will appreciate that I cannot pre-empt the consultation, nor can I pre-empt the announcements on funding for 2013/14, which I expect to be made in December in the usual way.

Despite the challenges, or maybe because of them, I know that you as the professional leaders for the fire and rescue sector are making great strides in efficiency. You have well established processes in place to use integrated risk management plans to make strategic and operational decisions on the siting of fire stations, the staffing and equipping of such stations, and hours of operation of each station. You are looking at your own service configuration to delivering services in a new environment. Some of you are looking at how you use your estate, I know for example that Merseyside are working with the police to share headquarters, that partners in the North West and partners in the South are sharing control rooms.   
Just last week I visited my local constituency fire and rescue authority, Norfolk, who updated me on their Combined fire and rescue, police and ambulance station in Sheringham which officially opened in January this year.

Sharing buildings is also bringing collaboration on other matters, and I am sure that all of you are looking outside your own sector to see how the country's national emergency services estate could be better used - sharing facilities and back office services. I know that you are increasingly working with the Ambulance Service and that inter-agency collaborations and interoperability are becoming increasingly important. I'm sure there are ways that we can work and share with the Ambulance Service and other partners and not only improve the services we deliver but also become more efficient.

### Engagement

Well, in two weeks, you can imagine that I am only just scratching the surface of what your issues are. I have already met with Cllr Kay Hammond, who as you know is the new Chair of the Fire Services Management Committee. I outlined to Cllr Hammond that I want to strengthen my engagement with your elected politicians, and I have made clear that as well as having a more regular engagement with the FSMC, I will want to meet chairs and members of fire and rescue authorities. I know that as the professional leadership of the sector you will want to support your councilors in meetings with me.

I also want to broaden my engagement with CFOA as the representative body for senior professionals. I will be meeting with your president, vice-president and vice-president elect. After this I want my engagement to be with the Board and the Council - I want to hear a broad range of views, and I will make time to engage with you on a regular basis and intend to get out and about visiting as many of your areas as possible.

### CFRA

The National Framework specifically embeds the key role of the post of the Chief Fire and Rescue Adviser who provides professional, independent advice both to senior officials and Ministers. The post was first created in 2007 with Sir Ken Knight filling the position since that time. However, earlier this year Ken indicated that, having completed five years, and with the Olympics behind us it was the right time to move on.

Having served in Fire and Rescue for over 40 years, including positions as Chief Fire Officer of County, Combined and Metropolitan Fire Authorities as well as the Fire Commissioner for London, Ken has provided consistent and professional advice to my predecessors as he continues to give me. I have hugely valued his input in my first weeks.

The Secretary of State and I recognise the value and importance of professional advice within the Department and therefore we will shortly be advertising for Ken's successor whilst I am delighted that Ken has agreed to remain in post until the appointment is made. I hope that senior professionals will take an interest in the post, seeing it as an opportunity to utilise their knowledge and experience to support officials and Ministers.

We will also be continue to provide opportunities for secondments from the sector to contribute professional views to the development of government policy and give individuals a chance to develop and to experience the workings of government. I hope you will see DCLG as a good place to send your brightest officers as a key part of their career progression.

There will be other opportunities to say thank you to Ken but I wanted to place on record the Government's appreciation for the support and advice he has given through the last challenging five years, and of course the previous 41 years in fire and rescue.

### Conclusion

I hope that I have given you a clear indication of where my priorities lie. I recognise that there are tough times ahead but I believe fire and rescue authorities and Chief Fire Officers can provide the leadership needed to continue to deliver a trusted and excellent public service. A new and more collaborative national-local relationship provides an opportunity for fire and rescue authorities, and organisations like CFOA, to play an ever stronger part in setting the agenda and in keeping our communities and our nation safe. I look forward to working with you all. Fire and rescue services are hugely respected in the UK and have the ability to reach high.

Thank you.

_Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version._

In one week's time the Jewish community will be celebrating Rosh Hashanah. Both the Jewish New Year and a Day of Remembrance. But when it comes to the Holocaust the duty of remembrance falls on us all.

Remembrance is not to be confused with memory. Remembrance is the conscious effort: to step into somebody else's shoes; to light a candle for the generation that has gone before; to cast light on the millions of lives snuffed out; to illuminate the lost byways, the forgotten streets, the villages ransacked of life and laughter.

Remembrance fills the void statistics leaves behind. It tells us who was the mother, the father, the daughter, the son. It helps us imagine who might have lit up their community. Who might have become the next Einstein, or the next Ludgwig Guttman. The Jewish refugee from Nazism who founded the fantastic Paralympics.

And there is no better aid to remembrance than education. So I want to pay tribute to the Holocaust Educational Trust for your work. It makes me proud to think, almost a quarter of a century on from your founding by Lord Janner and the late Lord Rees, that you continue to shine a light into history's darkest recesses. To provide teaching resources to classrooms and campuses.To send out hugely impressive volunteers. Not just to speak of the unimaginable depths of human suffering. But - since some of those volunteers are also survivors - to bear witness to the illimitable strength of the human spirit.

And, of course, the Trust continues to send young people to witness despair's cul de sac at Auschwitz Birkenau. Having made that journey myself I know it never leaves you. Nor the chill of realising that destructive hate could strike, not in some medieval dark age, but in our modern world. In the cradle of our Western civilisation. In the birthplace of Durer, Kant and Shiller.

Now the man who pioneered these one day visits to Auschwitz was Rabbi Barry Marcus. And he has been a constant on every single visit over the past 13 years. In that time he has met some 17000 students and teachers. To each he poses the same searching question. Not - where was God in Auschwitz - but where was man? It is a profound challenge that forces us to confront Primo Levi's terrible truth that:

> ""It happened, therefore it can happen again"".

Because Holocaust remembrance is never just about the past, it is a shofar blast to us here today. A shofar blast against prejudice. A shofar blast against discrimination. A shofar blast that would deny hate any sanctuary, any refuge, any hiding place. So future generations might walk our streets without fear.

Recently one six former returning from a trip to Auschwitz said:

> ""This experience will affect me for the rest of my life, and I will try to use it to remind myself and others how extremely dangerous prejudices can be.""

That is why we continue supporting Holocaust remembrance and visits to Auschwitz. And why it is now my privilege and pleasure to present Rabbi Marcus - scion of Talmudic nobility - with an honour of his own. A small token of thanks for his immense contribution not just to the Jewish community but to our wider society.

_Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version._

Well, it's great to be here to today. Talking about pubs and beer. And I'm in exalted company.

![Pub sign](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2149202.jpg)George & Dragon pub

British historian A.J.P. Taylor thought; 

> ""most of the great men of the past were only there for the beer.""

He appears to have been right.

William Shakespeare said:

> ""A quart of ale is a dish for a king.""

Dr Johnson believed:

> ""There is nothing which has been yet contrived by man, by which so much happiness is produced as by a good tavern or inn.""

And when, in the July election of 1945, Times editor suggested to Winston Churchill that he retire gracefully soon after the campaign… the great man replied;

> ""Mr. Editor, I leave when the pub closes.""

All these patrons knew what we know. That what we drink and where we drink tells us who we are. And nothing says Britain more than our Great British pub and our Great British beer.

They are part of a tradition dating back to ancient times. Beer was drunk in the taverns of Roman England. In the Anglo-Saxon alehouse. In the inns of the Middle Age.

> ""The 'local' is the beating heart of our communities""

Before I came here today I did a bit of a pub crawl - online of course. It turns out that within a one mile radius of this building there are more than 400 pubs. And their names might as well be chapters from a history of Britain.

  * Boadicea
  * Shakespeare
  * George and the Dragon
  * Silver Cross
  * Battle of Trafalgar

And it's curious how history reflected in a pint glass, is history brought sharply into focus.

We can almost see Samuel Pepys witnessing the Great Fire of London in 1666 from ""a little alehouse on Bankside"".

Doctor Johnson penning his famous Dictionary at The Anchor in Southwark.

Dirty Den handing Anj the divorce papers on a Christmas night in the Queen Vic.

And Bet Lynch leaving the Rovers Return for the last time.

But while pubs are tied to our past they are equally an essential part of our present.

We call it the 'local' because it is the beating heart of our communities.

The place we gather.

> to socialise  
to celebrate  
to commiserate  
to champion and to cherish our way of life

But I'm not going to get all misty eyed today.

> ""Pubs and beer mean business.""

Pub and beer mean business. And a heady mix of the worlds best beer and the world's best brewers…

> …a potent cocktail of our famous beer companies  
…our industrious family brewers  
…our innovative microbreweries…  
...have made this industry a colossus.

The facts speak for themselves.

Individually, according to the British Beer and Pub Association, each pub contributes an estimated £80,000 to its local economy. Collectively, they contribute over £19 billion to the national economy. And in total they're sustaining nearly 900,000 jobs.

That's why for all their historical and cultural significance, our pubs must be a vital part of our economic future.

Now it's been a tough few years for your industry. But we're not abandoning the local to its fate.

We've made sure small business rate relief - which we've doubled until the end of March next year - and rural rate relief are available to our public houses.

We're distilled rules on weights and measures for intoxicating liquor into simplified form.

And we're canning sales of alcohol below cost-price by supermarkets. Most pubs should experience the benefit of this minimum unit price.

And we're even making it far easier for you to play live music at your venues. Taking away the usual licensing rules from performances where the audience numbers 200 or fewer. We want people to make a song and a dance. But, in the pub, not over the paperwork.

These reforms will, I hope be the fillip the industry needs as we look forward to a summer of royal and sporting celebration. A triple whammy of festivity. The Diamond Jubilee, Olympics, the European Championship. Events that will have punters across the world beating a path to your door.

Now I want to make sure I do everything I can to make sure you're in the shape of your life in the coming months.

But this isn't just about me. It's about you too.

It's an open secret that, over the past few years, pub companies and licensees haven't always seen eye to eye.

A fact reflected in the Government's Select Committee report on pub companies last year.

Now we take your concerns about regulation very seriously. And we've listened. That's why we've got self-regulation not central regulation.

But make no mistake. This is about you grasping the nettle.

I can see there have been a lot of improvements;

  * a strengthened industry code
  * greater transparency
  * a new arbitration and mediation service

All good work. But don't expect me to pat you on the back just yet.

Now's the time to make good on your promise. Go further. Go faster. Do what you need to do to convince the doubters things have changed.

You need to put your house in order. Otherwise you might find the dead hand of Whitehall feeling your collar.

Now I started out by saying pubs are at the heart of local communities. I'd like to finish with a nod to our work on community pubs.

In the past few years we've seen local people coming forward to save their local.

The Rookhope Inn in Weardale was rescued by Sunderland-based charity St Aidan's Community Trust.

When the town of Hesket Newmarket faced losing their local, they didn't get bitter, they got bolder.

Now they are running it themselves.

My Cabinet colleague William Hague is one of almost 200 members to have rescued the only pub in the small North Yorkshire village of Hudswell.

![embed: ](https://www.youtube.com/v/rVYk7KCiFjw?version=3&hl=en_GB&rel=0)

  * [Hudswell community pub - transcript](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/newsroom/word/1867361.doc)

MS Word, 25 kb, 2 pages

In my constituency a couple of pals didn't save a pub. They built a brewery.

The founders of the Brentwood Brewing Company said:

> ""We tasted a pint, thought that's not brilliant - we can do better than this!""

But Community Right to Bid means help is on tap. It requires local authorities to keep a record of their valuable community assets.

When they come up for sale, the community can call for a six month time out.

Prepare a bid.

Organise a whip round.

And save their pub from extinction.

But let's be honest. Saving a pub is one thing. Running it is something else.

The community spirited pub owner can often find themselves dealing less with a going concern. Than a growing concern. Once the scales fall from their eyes they find themselves facing more bureaucratic barriers than an Olympic hurdler.

Over the past couple of years we've had what we've called, in Government circles, the Red Tape Challenge.

This is starting to make headway in hacking through a forest of regulation, for example, in regard to the hospitality industry. Some of which will clearly have a bearing on you.

But in the coming months we will also be casting our eye over the community pub sector to see if there are other areas where we can wield the red tape axe.

We need to make sure folk with a bit of get up and go don't have all their enthusiasm watered down by a ministry of meddlers.

So we're taking action to help the pub industry. Helping those who run community pubs.

Acting because pubs and brewing play a unique role in our lives. They are part of the warp and woof of our country.

And we're determined to make sure they remain at the heart of our nation long into our future.

### Introduction

> ""India has an unparalleled desire, an unquenchable enthusiasm, an unshakeable belief in the future.""

It's a privilege to be here tonight and to follow such distinguished guest speakers.

Anyone who knows me will know I love India, from India's democracy - the largest in the history of the world - a pillar of stability in an unsettled region, to the music of Ravi Shankar that fills my iPod. Not to mention, of course, India's great cricketing heritage.

And standing here at the home of cricket magical memories of golden summers come flooding back: Kapil Dev striking four consecutive sixes to save the follow on; Rahul Dravid lifting his bat to celebrate a century, engraving his name on the honours board for all time. Like many neutrals I was sad to see India exit the TwentyTwenty World Cup at an early stage. As a long suffering England fan I certainly knew how Indian fans must be feeling.

### India's ambition

Yet there is something else about India that I admire. Something contained in its literature, its mathematics, its music, its films and its sport. Something that its great companies like George's Muthoot Group and golden peacock winners past and present display in abundance. And that is ambition.

India has an unparalleled desire, an unquenchable enthusiasm, an unshakeable belief in the future. It epitomises Gandhi's words to:

> ""Be the change you want to see in the world.""

I first came across that ambition as a youngster growing up in Bradford. I saw how the Indian community was a vibrant, galvanising, positive force that transformed local life.

> ""Britain is the place to be... a place where sustainable companies can strut their stuff.""

Today I see that ambition again in the way the wildfire of economic liberalisation has ignited the Indian economy, spreading growth from city to city, from the fantastic new airports in Bangalore and Hyderabad, to the Bandra-Worli Sea Link in Mumbai and to the metro to Delhi. And it is the tremendous driving force of India's ambition that has set it firmly on the path towards becoming an economic superpower.

### Britain is the land of opportunity

Now there's an old Hindi saying that I believe translates as:

> ""Gone abroad and come home a peacock.""

And for those with ambition Britain is the place to be. This is the land of opportunity - a place where sustainable companies can strut their stuff. We didn't just host an Olympic Games last month, we didn't just create an Olympic stadium - more sustainable than any of its predecessors, we didn't just run the most successful Paralympics ever - at which our very own golden Peacock (Jonnie Peacock) smashed the world 100 metres record. We founded an Olympic legacy.

You will find it ten miles to the east in the blossoming Olympic Park in Stratford. A once desolate wasteland  that now houses new sporting wonders of the world, that stand alongside Westfield - Europe's largest new shopping centre and next to a new tech city.

### Growth across the country

This picture of growth is being replicated right the way across the country, from the Thames Gateway to the Atlantic Gateway, from the Marches to Manchester, from the Solent to Sheffield.

We've taken a leaf out of India's Panchayati Raj system and recognised that we're better off when we take power out of the hands of senior elected representatives and let local communities take charge.

So we've now got Local Enterprise Partnerships - coalitions of local business and local authorities - forming natural economic alliances.

And creating Enterprise Zones - with relaxed planning rules, superfast broadband and generous business rates to fire up their local economies and attract eager inward investors.

Meanwhile, we've let our great cities like Birmingham Liverpool and Nottingham off the leash to renew their industrial might of old and conquer new frontiers in bioscience and advanced manufacturing.

### Building on a great relationship

Now we're proud of our relationship with India, proud that companies of the calibre of our winners today can come here. Proud that Tata's investment in steel production and car manufacture is safeguarding jobs from Teesside to Wolverhampton. Proud that 180 Indian firms invest in our IT sector. Together it's a relationship that brings in £16.8billion a year.

And as someone who loves India, you can only imagine my pleasure at becoming a member of a Government committed to strengthening an already powerful bond.

After all, when times are tough in the Eurozone and the world in general, supporting open markets and free enterprise becomes more important, not less. And supporting the trade, commerce and investment between our two countries is more essential, more valuable, than ever before. So that's why we are expanding our frontline diplomatic staff.

That's why the Prime Minister and Chancellor made a point of visiting within months of taking office, accompanied by many British CEOs. And it is why today you will find British businesses across the land eyeing up the opportunities India is offering. They know that India is looking to invest $1trillion in infrastructure in the years ahead. And having tested their mettle on the biggest infrastructure project in Europe, having worked on projects like Crossrail, they are champing at the bit to help a country whose destiny will be to remould our future.

### Conclusion

Now over in the Olympic Park you will find a great totem to Anglo-Indian ambition, the towering ArcelorMittal Orbit, 115 metres of steel proudly proclaiming that, when it comes to our friendship, the sky is the limit.

And it is my hope to visit India early in the new year, to do absolutely everything I can to realise the enormous promise of our relationship. To help British and Indian companies ruffle some feathers, grasp the burgeoning opportunities out there, and in the coming years bring a pride of golden peacocks home to roost.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/speeches/fire/firesummit2012,Fire Sector Summit 2012,"* * *

_Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version._

I would like to say how delighted I am to be invited to speak to this Summit - an event that grows in importance every year.

I am particularly pleased that the Summit brings together all parts of the fire industry - not only those who deliver the fire and rescue service at the sharp end, but all those who, often behind the scenes, do so much to ensure the buildings we live in and the products we use on a daily basis, are safe.

### A success story

And in terms of fires you should all congratulate yourselves on a considerable success story. In England, fire fatalities and non-fatal casualties fell by 34 per cent and 54 per cent respectively between 2001-02 and 2011-12, and the average area of fire damage fell by 20 per cent in dwellings and around 10 per cent in other buildings during the same period. Last year, total fires fell by 6 per cent to 227,000. I very much hope that these trends continue way into the future.

As part of Government's commitment to maintaining a high profile focus on prevention activity, the Fire Kills campaign is currently running its hugely successful national advertising campaign. As with last year, we are encouraging everyone to test their smoke alarms when they change their clocks this weekend as you are four times more likely to die in a fire if you do not have a working smoke alarm. I would ask that in order to extend the reach and breadth of the campaign, you use your own websites to disseminate this important message. By working together we have the opportunity to really drive home the importance of fire safe behaviour and maintain the downward trend on fire deaths.

The interaction between the fire industry and fire and rescue is a complex one - and for that reason I am delighted that the Fire Sector Federation is playing an increasingly important role in pulling all parts of the fire industry together, into a forum where ideas and knowledge can be exchanged. And I would particularly like to thank Brian Robinson, the Chairman of the Federation, for his hard work and perseverance in bringing the Federation to life.

### The importance of co-operation

Growth is a top priority for this Government. Supporting business growth for both new and existing companies is fundamental to our approach. And encouraging the creation of new businesses and sectors is crucial to this country's future. These new businesses will help to create the necessary wealth and growth, and much needed jobs. But we need also to ensure that both new and existing businesses are strong and resilient, including safeguarding and protecting them from the devastating effects of a fire.

All of you here today will know, a fire can result in a business loss both in terms of its employees, its contribution to the local economy, and ability to recover and trade again in the aftermath of an incident.

I urge the fire sector to go out and proactively engage with representative bodies for industry and commerce and make the case for effective and proportionate fire protection - passive and active interventions - in all areas of business in England.

### False alarms

The industry also has a vitally important role to play in ensuring that we make the best use of innovative technology. You will know better than me, the scope for technology to improve resilience to fire - but one area where more can be done is in limiting the number of false alarms. Last year there were 249,000 fire false alarms.

London Fire Brigade says that despite a reduction of 23 per cent in false alarms in the last five years, a fire engine is still called to a false alarm every 12 minutes in the capital, costing an estimated £34 million every year. More importantly, these unnecessary calls impact on the Brigade's ability to attend real incidents, deliver training and carry out vital community safety work.

I believe that technology can address this issue. To that end I have asked Brian Robinson to see what the industry itself can do to drive down false alarms through improved technology. Brian has asked a Fire Sector Federation working group under Martin Harvey to look into this issue - and I very much look forward to hearing their findings.

### Workforce development

Another area where I see significant improvement is in relation to workforce development in fire and rescue services. Here collaborative working between the Sector Skills Council - Skills for Fire and Rescue, and the Chief Fire Officers Association amongst others, is starting to produce tangible results, especially in the risk critical areas of intervention activity. Such work helps underpin Integrated Risk Management Plans, interoperability, national resilience and common working. Much energy is being devoted to this work. I would like to thank Max Hood, the chair of the National Occupational Committee for his efforts in leading this work.

### Public procurement

I know that many of you have an interest in public procurement and accessing new markets. This is an area where Government is keen to help. As you may know, the Government has put in place the Contracts Finder website, aimed at making it easier for suppliers to find and apply for public sector contracts. It is the main source of government opportunities worth more than £10,000.

My Department has already approached certain fire and rescue authorities to help populate pipelines and is very grateful for the assistance given to date. We are now asking all fire and rescue authorities for help to get as much information on future procurements in the pipeline - this should not be difficult as fire and rescue authorities should already be publishing this information existing contracts and tenders under the Local Government Transparency Code. The information on future procurements will help strengthen the UK Supply Chain by identifying current gaps between supply and demand and giving industry the confidence to invest for the future.

The Government is also committed to devolving power away from Whitehall so that fire and rescue authorities can decide how they can deliver services in a way that best meets their communities' needs. I hope that the fire sector can join together to develop new ways of working and further innovation that can stimulate growth for all.

### Youth employment

I want to speak a little about youth employment. In response to the challenge of youth unemployment, year the Deputy Prime Minister has launched a £1billion Youth Contract to help unemployed people get a job. The Youth Contract will provide a number of new opportunities for young people, including apprenticeships and work experience placements. Many of you will be aware of the The Prince's Trust Fire Industry Scheme, and some have supported it. I wish to thank you for that, and encourage others to get involved if they can.

I know a number of fire and rescue authorities have started training apprentices. I was particularly impressed to hear that in Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service 12 young people have started a community safety apprenticeship.

The apprentices are young people who have already had some contact with Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service, for example through the Prince's Trust courses, cadets and Fire Fly following a targeted recruitment campaign.

To support them through the application process, they put on a 10-day pre-recruitment course - run by Salford City College - to give candidates an understanding of working with people in the communities they would serve, as well as meeting a Community Safety Adviser who is already in the job, so they know exactly what the role entails.

I would like to commend Greater Manchester for this valuable initiative, and wish the new entrants every possible success in their apprenticeship, and future careers.

### Retained duty system firefighters

And finally, the one area where industry and the fire and rescue service co-operate on a daily, if not hourly basis, is in the retained duty system. There is no doubt that the retained duty system is the backbone of the fire and rescue response in large swathes of the United Kingdom. We must as leaders in the fire sector, where ever possible, bring to people's attention the valuable work done by retained duty firefighters, and encourage employers and members of the public to offer their services to this essential service.

Thank you.

### Introduction

I am delighted to be here today in my second full week in my new job. I'd like congratulate Vij (Randeniya) on his election as the new CFOA President and thank Lee (Howell) for all his work as part of the presidential team.

I would like to put on record my thanks to fire and rescue authorities for the important role they played in torch relays across the United Kingdom and during the Olympic and Paralympics Games.

Although the role that fire and rescue authorities played has gone almost unnoticed in the public eye, the effort and resources which were put in place were greatly appreciated across Government. I am pleased that a number of fire and rescue authority staff who made a significant contribution in delivery of services will be receiving recognition in the form of a commemorative medallion.

I'd also like to play tribute to Bob Neill, who I know had a deep understanding of the issues you face, a huge knowledge of the sector, and who worked closely with you on resetting the relationship between central and local government, devolving power and responsibility to the front line professionals, to communities and their local elected representatives - where it rightly sits.

I am very pleased to have been given this brief and I look forward to working with you and your elected members in the coming weeks, months and, hopefully, years. I'm particularly pleased to say that my new brief maintains the link between fire and rescue and local government. Alongside my fire responsibilities I am also local government Minister. This is particularly important to me as I am a keen proponent of local determination on service delivery, on prioritisation and on spending decisions. Keeping the fire and local government link is vital in this and I am sure you will be pleased to hear that I intend to continue Bob's good work here, embedding localism, continuing the integration of funding via the business rates system, and more importantly, getting out of the way to let you do what you do best.

### Fire Prevention

We will of course, continue to support you where it is appropriate. Thankfully, the number of fires and associated fatalities and injuries continue to fall. The latest statistics show fire deaths in the home have more than halved in the last twenty years - and fell 12 per cent last year.

This is a fantastic achievement and the Fire Kills campaign is a great example of how effective a partnership between Government and local fire and rescue authorities can be. The campaign's annual report for 2011/12 was published last week. It clearly demonstrates the range and impact of fire prevention activity being delivered by both the Department through its media campaign, and by its partners. The outstanding success of this campaign is, as you know, in large part due to the sterling, and often innovative, work undertaken at the local level to embed its fire safety messages with both the general public, and with those who may be especially vulnerable to the risks from fire.

Ultimately, the commitment of you and your local partners to the prevention agenda saves lives and resources. It ensures that our communities are safer places, less exposed to the destruction and devastation caused by fire.

The challenge must now be to maintain that clear focus on fire prevention, community safety and resilience. Working together allows us to deliver consistent safety messages, tailoring and targeting the campaign to maximise its effectiveness at the local level.

Next month, the Fire Kills campaign will again be running the hugely successful national advertising campaign to encourage everyone to test that their smoke alarms are working when changing their clocks. I'm sure you'll already be considering how best to support this at the local level.

By working together we have the opportunity to really drive home the importance of fire safe behaviour and maintain the downward trend on fire deaths. Given its impact, I am committed to maintaining a high profile focus on community fire prevention and safety activity.

### Resilience

Prevention activity doesn't just relate to improving fire safety. We have a model for civil contingency delivery that fits with our views of localism: planning and action at local level based on local risks and with partners having local accountability to make your localities more resilient places.

I know fire and rescue authorities are increasingly providing strategic leadership to local multi-agency emergency planning activity, with Chief Fire Officers chairing four of England's 38 local resilience forums.

This means fire and rescue authorities working with partners locally to better identify and mitigate complex resilience risks that could disrupt everyday life; including flooding, severe winter weather, disruption to fuel supplies or security threats. I hope, as I'm sure you do, that your role in responding to these types of emergencies is not called upon. But in my role as Minister for fire, resilience and emergencies I am keen to hear more about the good examples of the role of fire and rescue authorities in local multi-agency planning that strengthens our ability to quickly respond and recover from disruptive events.

### A clear vision for local delivery - The National Framework

At the very heart of the Government's ambition is putting power back where it belongs - in communities and with the locally elected councilors who represent them.

Fire and rescue authorities have been empowered with greater freedoms and flexibilities. You now have general powers of competence and an equivalent general power along with the ability to consult locally to allow charging for additional activities including the option for charging for persistent false reports. These are good examples of central Government stepping back and letting you get on with your job.

The Fire and Rescue National Framework is currently proceeding through parliament, and will be fully in force in October this year. I've come to it new. But I like what I see. For me, it embodies the right approach; setting high level principles instead of detailed requirements - it's 'what' not 'how'. I am pleased to hear that CFOA has welcomed this document. I would also like to thank you for the support and advice I understand you gave to officials as part of the working group. I think we should all be proud of the Framework, one that moves away from prescription to empowerment, and one that clearly sets out three bold priorities for fire and rescue authorities to:

  * identify and assess the full range of foreseeable fire and rescue related risks their areas face, make provision for prevention and protection activities and respond to incidents appropriately
  * work in partnership with their communities and a wide range of partners locally and nationally to deliver their service; and
  * be accountable to communities for the service they provide.

It goes without saying that this includes the business community. I firmly believe that businesses have the right to expect that those enforcing regulatory compliance do so in accordance with the fundamental principles of better regulation. I know that CFOA are keen to address shortcomings in this area and to lead work at the local level to develop fire safety audit and enforcement responsibilities to reflect more closely the aspirations that businesses have. Essentially, this means for helpful, proportionate and consistent advice on compliance.

Given that economic growth and business support is our number one priority, I commend you for your approach and look forward to a positive progression of this significant tranche of work.

Our national resilience to major fire and rescue related risks remains a priority for government. But we can only do this together, through true partnership, working across all local and national responders.

That is why we have put in place the Fire and Rescue Strategic Resilience Board, and it is already bringing key partners together to consider national resilience issues. Of course, government will continue to set the strategic direction, but our approach to national resilience must be based on and drawn from local capability alongside your professional expertise.

We can only prepare effectively if we have an approach to resilience based on local expertise and knowledge. Communities rightly expect their local fire and rescue authorities to play their part in keeping the country safe; every major emergency originates as a local emergency and being able to plan effectively for all incidents and emergencies, irrespective of whether they are of a local, cross-border or national nature, is essential.   
In delivering for your communities, you need to engage them - give them a real understanding of the risks being faced and the full range of what you are doing so they can better understand why you make the decisions you do.

We all know there are some increasingly tough decisions to be made on how best to allocate prevention, protection and operational resources locally - this needs to be done in a way that meets community aspirations in an open and consultative way.

By giving communities a voice, you give them a choice:

  * choice to make their views known on whether their priorities are the same as yours
  * choice to come up with new ideas on service provision; and
  * choice to challenge you on these issues.

Going further, we are today launching a  consultation on assurance statements, a mechanism for showing the public how the services they provide are run by their authorities. I know that some of you have mixed feelings on such statements. But for me this is about demonstrating a commitment to greater openness, showing the taxpayer how their money (including council tax) is spent, enabling communities to hold their authorities to account over how they spend the public's money and for the decisions that they make. And some of you are already doing it very well. Every aspect of council business - including the decisions they make for the delivery of fire and rescue - should be open to public scrutiny including senior pay, councillor expenses and local services.

### Economic context

I am of course mindful of the financial backdrop we all face. We have taken tough decisions necessary to reduce the budget deficit that we inherited from the last administration. Every bit of the public sector needs to do its bit to help, and local government accounts for a quarter of the public sector.

I value the incredibly important service that fire and rescue authorities deliver for local communities, and the part they play in national resilience. Despite the need to cut the national deficit, fire and rescue, as a frontline emergency service, has been given funding protection with reductions back-loaded to give more time for sensible savings to be made and reductions applied to fire and rescue authorities have been less than those applied to local authorities in general.

You will know that we are currently consulting upon plans for 2013-15 funding as part of the business rates retention scheme - this consultation is due to close on the 24th of September and I know that many of you have already engaged in the process. I would urge those whose voices have not yet been heard to ensure they make their views known.

I know that you are anxious to see what funding might look like from 2013, but I'm sure you will appreciate that I cannot pre-empt the consultation, nor can I pre-empt the announcements on funding for 2013/14, which I expect to be made in December in the usual way.

Despite the challenges, or maybe because of them, I know that you as the professional leaders for the fire and rescue sector are making great strides in efficiency. You have well established processes in place to use integrated risk management plans to make strategic and operational decisions on the siting of fire stations, the staffing and equipping of such stations, and hours of operation of each station. You are looking at your own service configuration to delivering services in a new environment. Some of you are looking at how you use your estate, I know for example that Merseyside are working with the police to share headquarters, that partners in the North West and partners in the South are sharing control rooms.   
Just last week I visited my local constituency fire and rescue authority, Norfolk, who updated me on their Combined fire and rescue, police and ambulance station in Sheringham which officially opened in January this year.

Sharing buildings is also bringing collaboration on other matters, and I am sure that all of you are looking outside your own sector to see how the country's national emergency services estate could be better used - sharing facilities and back office services. I know that you are increasingly working with the Ambulance Service and that inter-agency collaborations and interoperability are becoming increasingly important. I'm sure there are ways that we can work and share with the Ambulance Service and other partners and not only improve the services we deliver but also become more efficient.

### Engagement

Well, in two weeks, you can imagine that I am only just scratching the surface of what your issues are. I have already met with Cllr Kay Hammond, who as you know is the new Chair of the Fire Services Management Committee. I outlined to Cllr Hammond that I want to strengthen my engagement with your elected politicians, and I have made clear that as well as having a more regular engagement with the FSMC, I will want to meet chairs and members of fire and rescue authorities. I know that as the professional leadership of the sector you will want to support your councilors in meetings with me.

I also want to broaden my engagement with CFOA as the representative body for senior professionals. I will be meeting with your president, vice-president and vice-president elect. After this I want my engagement to be with the Board and the Council - I want to hear a broad range of views, and I will make time to engage with you on a regular basis and intend to get out and about visiting as many of your areas as possible.

### CFRA

The National Framework specifically embeds the key role of the post of the Chief Fire and Rescue Adviser who provides professional, independent advice both to senior officials and Ministers. The post was first created in 2007 with Sir Ken Knight filling the position since that time. However, earlier this year Ken indicated that, having completed five years, and with the Olympics behind us it was the right time to move on.

Having served in Fire and Rescue for over 40 years, including positions as Chief Fire Officer of County, Combined and Metropolitan Fire Authorities as well as the Fire Commissioner for London, Ken has provided consistent and professional advice to my predecessors as he continues to give me. I have hugely valued his input in my first weeks.

The Secretary of State and I recognise the value and importance of professional advice within the Department and therefore we will shortly be advertising for Ken's successor whilst I am delighted that Ken has agreed to remain in post until the appointment is made. I hope that senior professionals will take an interest in the post, seeing it as an opportunity to utilise their knowledge and experience to support officials and Ministers.

We will also be continue to provide opportunities for secondments from the sector to contribute professional views to the development of government policy and give individuals a chance to develop and to experience the workings of government. I hope you will see DCLG as a good place to send your brightest officers as a key part of their career progression.

There will be other opportunities to say thank you to Ken but I wanted to place on record the Government's appreciation for the support and advice he has given through the last challenging five years, and of course the previous 41 years in fire and rescue.

### Conclusion

I hope that I have given you a clear indication of where my priorities lie. I recognise that there are tough times ahead but I believe fire and rescue authorities and Chief Fire Officers can provide the leadership needed to continue to deliver a trusted and excellent public service. A new and more collaborative national-local relationship provides an opportunity for fire and rescue authorities, and organisations like CFOA, to play an ever stronger part in setting the agenda and in keeping our communities and our nation safe. I look forward to working with you all. Fire and rescue services are hugely respected in the UK and have the ability to reach high.

Thank you.

_Transcript of the speech as delivered._

#### Introduction - working together

Thank you for that introduction.

Tonight I should like to speak briefly and specifically about how we can increase the supply of homes.

I do so, in one sense as the most dangerous type of Ministers (my civil servants will take that view!), namely someone who has a little knowledge of what he is talking about!

As a Chartered Surveyor, I feel I have some understanding of the housing and the construction markets. But I come to this role knowing that frankly I still have much to learn, particularly about the social housing sector.

So let me start by saying that I want to listen. The expertise when I look gathered here around the room is one I intend not to ignore. Indeed it's experience which I value. There will be times when we won't always agree, but if we work together, we can make a real difference.

#### Government's role

As a Government we are already setting the direction.

Last November, we established the Housing Strategy as our long term framework for future action.

In the Spring, we introduced a series of key policies, including for example New Buy, which has the capability of helping up to 100,000 people.

And just two weeks ago, a day after I was in post, we set out a comprehensive set of measures to accelerate progress. Those measures include:

  * Building up to another 15,000 new affordable homes and bringing an extra 5,000 empty homes back into use;
  * Putting an additional £280 million into FirstBuy - so around 27,000 will now be able to buy their first home; and
  * Confirming Government Guarantees of up to £10 billion, for the development of many more new rented homes.

Now, these guarantees in particular have the potential to galvanise the sector. And it shows that, despite inheriting an enormous deficit, this Government is absolutely committed to providing the policies and resources needed to build the homes people want.

These new measures build on the £1.3 billion that is already working to unlock stalled housing schemes, and the Affordable Homes Programme of £19.5 billion, which we are confident, will deliver up to 170,000 new affordable homes.

Taken together with our reforms to the planning system and the rented sectors, these policies represent the best way to improve our housing provision in both the short and longer term.

#### Challenge

But, tonight, if I may, I would also like to issue a challenge.

I said earlier that I value your collected expertise and capability. Many of the organisations represented here provide a wide range of innovative social housing, and good services to existing tenants.   But I think you can do more.

There's a great opportunity to use your experience to develop more homes and serving a much wider group of people.

Housing associations are after all good at tailoring services that respect very different housing needs. Affordable home ownership is a good example.

I've seen the work of London and Quadrant on the former Olympic Park where they are already developing affordable homes for both rent and purchase.

And just last week Thames Valley launched their Fizzy Living scheme to prospective private tenants.

So what I'd like to challenge you all to think about is how you can develop homes for a much wider group of people, in different ways, and perhaps in different tenures.

We will help, not least through our newly announced housing guarantees; and the £200 million equity finance fund, so take it from me that we want you to be bold.

#### Clarity and stability for sector

As a former businessman I do, however, understand that for you to be innovative, you need longer term certainty about the market you work in and the direction of government policy.

This is especially true when it comes to the future of finance for affordable homes and the specific direction of policy on rents and policy reaching beyond the current spending review period.

Now on this, my ninth working day in the job, I can't set out for you the full detail for the next three years. But let me be clear:

  * I understand why you need that certainty;
  * I intend to address this longer term framework;
  * I want to do so working with you and others so we get it right.

#### True value of social housing

As a former Business Minister, I also know about the economic value of your sector: the ability to drive local growth.

Most people understand the social role of housing, whether owned, or rented, whether private or public.

And I strongly believe that housing is not merely about bricks and mortar. All of us need a home, somewhere we can call our own, somewhere that families can be secure and where children can grow.

And I shall want to address those social issues, whether it is the scourge of neighbours from hell, or the plight of the homeless.

However, increasing the housing supply, especially of affordable homes, also has an important economic purpose. One in which you and the organisations you represent have a vital role.

Building affordable homes, when you look at the bare statistics, is a great economic multiplier - and your buying power can help sustain local businesses.

You also provide jobs and help tackle worklessness. Thousands of young people have benefited from apprenticeships with construction companies on affordable housing projects.

And let me also to say to you that it doesn't matter how small your organisation is.  Indeed many of the smaller organisations are at the cutting edge of community activism, successfully using the new community rights that this Government has introduced.

It's about giving local people a say as to what goes on in their community - whether that's deciding where new homes are built, or how affordable housing is managed, this role is really important.   

So, while the issue of building new affordable homes is clearly front and centre - I also want to say that I recognise the vital role you play in helping to protect the homeless, the vulnerable and the marginalised in society.

#### Conclusion

So, Ladies and Gentlemen, we're putting in place a comprehensive set of measures to help this sector adapt and grow.

Of course, there are significant challenges, but as a Government we are determined to work with you to address both the short term symptoms and the long term causes.

That's why we're:

  * Providing our multi billion pound guarantees to help lever in new investment;
  * Removing the planning and financial barriers that are holding back the housing market; and
  * Developing a clear direction to help increase the supply of all forms of housing, owned or rented, public or private.

I think the package really has the opportunity to make a real difference and I am looking forward to working with you.

Overcoming the problems before us won't be easy.  But then, nothing worthwhile ever is.

Thank you.

_Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version._

Thank you for, once again, inviting me to speak at your annual conference. So much has happened in the last twelve months and I am privileged to have the opportunity to update you today on what we have been doing.

## Creating markets to support the growth agenda

The waste industry plays an important role in promoting local - and green - growth. Last year, local authority waste management contributed around £3.3 billion. This is a significant sum of money and its impact on the British economy should not be underestimated.

But it is not just an important growth industry, it is a vital service. Millions of people rely on it to take away their daily build up household waste.

It is the one service people know they get for their £120 a month in council tax. We can't lose sight of that. The vast majority of people are grateful for that service.

Much of this is down to people in this room and I would like to thank you all for your contribution. Without it this country would be a lot less pleasant a place to live.

## Localism

Many of the changes we have brought about in the last year are evidence of localism in action. We are giving local authorities and their residents a greater say in how their rubbish and recycling services are delivered.

We have brought about a 360 degree turn in how waste collections are thought about. Instead of a crime and punishment approach we want a system that focuses on the best possible service. Where it is easier for the council and the householders to do the right thing.

Where councils promote rewards and incentives, new technology, more joint working and better procurement, to support weekly rubbish and recycling collections.

We are supporting that aim by consigning bin taxes to the dustbin of history.

Since the start of the year no council can charge families - the people they serve - for overfilling their bin or introduce extra tariffs for taking away household waste. Pay as you throw is not the right way to improve collections.

Fortnightly collections are unpopular and unhygienic.

It's the traditional weekly bin round that people want to see. We have got rid of the Audit Commission guidance that started the shift to fortnightly pick ups. Councils will no longer be marked down for offering that service.

To help with the transition back to weekly collections we have put £250 million on the table through our Weekly Collection Support Scheme so that councils can reinstate, or retain weekly waste collections, alongside improving environmental benefits like improved recycling rates or greater cost effectiveness.

Householders will no longer face the threat of a £1,000 fine or a criminal conviction for mistakenly putting a yogurt pot in the wrong bin or leaving it out a little too long.

This Government knows that bin fines were the wrong way to go. So they are being abolished. Step one was to reduce the level of the fine to an acceptable level. It was ridiculous that someone who made a simple mistake like putting something in the wrong bin could be fined more than a shoplifter.

Next we will introduce a 'harm to local amenity' test so appropriate action can be taken against fly-tippers and consistent offenders, but not ordinary householders.

Localism is integral to boosting recycling and improving waste management, because it is about strengthened local accountability.

At the heart of our agenda, is the wish to see citizens able to hold their councils to account, for the services that they receive.

The Localism Act supports investment in infrastructure and recognises the pivotal role planning contributes to delivering and maintaining appropriate and effective waste facilities. We have made it easier for citizens to engage with and shape the impact of planning decisions in their local area.

This will help them engage more constructively on where to locate waste facilities.

## Weekly Collection Support Scheme

We launched our Weekly Collection Support Scheme in February this year.

The bids we have received show that there is significant scope for councils to increase recycling rates and improve a frontline service without cutting the frequency of collections.

As you know outline bids had to be sent in by last month and I am pleased to say that we received 166 bids. More than many people expected. There are a range of proposals including infrastructure projects and incentive schemes.

We are getting ready to give those bidders bespoke feedback later this month.

This will help local authorities as they seek to finalise and improve their bids in time for the final bids deadline of 17 August 2012.

In so many areas local authorities have ignored their residents' needs and chosen to cut bin collections; this Scheme encourages local authorities to keep householder interests at the heart of their waste collection service, where they belong.

Any savings must also lead to service improvements otherwise councils are just getting paid to provide a worse service. It will let councils make decisions for their people not their budgets. This is the principle at the heart of localism. Serve the people, rather than the Government.

Sutton Borough Council get this. They are listening. They consulted their local people through open houses and an online forum on the quality, frequency, and costs of bin collections as part of a drive to save a million pounds, or 25 per cent of their waste budget.

As a result Sutton is renewing its commitment to weekly collections of household waste. They found the savings by using new technology to improve collection routes that allowed them more flexible shift patterns.

Local authorities and their residents deserve to choose the service that they receive.

Councils have chosen to bid and I am delighted that so many have taken up the offer.

We have not prescribed how councils go about delivering a weekly collection service, but will favour councils being innovative or tailoring their services to local needs. There is no 'one size fits all' solution to a good, high quality waste collection service. They need to be bespoke. To fit each specific circumstance.

We are also making the money easily available: successful bidders can choose a 'one off payment' or spread it over (up to) three years.

Innovative councils will also embrace this opportunity to invest in more sustainable waste management options - such as increased recycling and smarter procurement deals.

For example, Sandwell has kept a weekly bin collection service and, at the same time, taken huge steps to boost recycling. Their partnership with Serco means that by 2020 Sandwell will be recycling or composting at least 60 per cent of household rubbish. The majority of the remainder will be turned into renewable energy leaving less than five per cent going to expensive landfill.

Thanks to increased recycling, an estimated £300 million savings will be made over 25 years.

And Portsmouth City Council are working with Biffa Waste Services to deliver weekly pick ups to over 200,000 residents in the city.

They'll save £1 million per year, reduce CO2 emissions and have new software technology.

Other local authorities should learn from this and use the Scheme to develop new, better, ways of working.

## Partnership Proposals

Lord Taylor spoke about the importance of partnership working yesterday and I would like to reiterate that message and highlight the importance of public-private partnerships.

The close co-operation of local authorities and industry with local communities will help find the right solution for each place that puts the householder at the centre of the service while meeting our recycling targets and providing even greater value for money for the council tax payer.

## Planning

I've already touched briefly on planning. It goes hand in hand with localism. Planning plays a pivotal role in delivering new waste management facilities that improve services and help move waste up the waste hierarchy. But, as I said, they can be very unpopular neighbours.

As you will know, we did not think that the previous planning system was working. It was too adversarial and too complex. And too few plans were coming forward. That is why we are reforming the planning system.

It is important local people see the direct benefits of the facilities needed to provide the waste services that they want. So that rather than having to go through the courts trying to impose on them, as was done before, communities will welcome them.

Together the Localism Act and the National Planning Policy Framework are reinforcing our localist approach. Decisions are being taken by those who know their areas best. It firmly places communities at the heart of decision making. It decentralises the power and responsibility to shape places out of Whitehall.

It also enshrines the Local Plan and confirms that planning should focus on local needs, empowering local people to shape their surroundings, setting out a positive vision for the future of their area.

And whilst there is a transition period of 12 months for those local authorities that have recently adopted a Local Plan, my advice to all councils is to press ahead and ensure they have an up-to-date plan in place at the earliest opportunity.

## Influencing behaviours

We want to see more householders recycling. We don't want them to live in fear of being caught accidentally doing the wrong thing or feeling like they have been coerced into recycling. We want to enable residents to make well-informed decisions and choose to recycle. We want them to understand the benefits that recycling brings - both environmental and economic.

Reward schemes like Recyclebank and Local Green Points are already being successfully used to encourage residents to increase recycling rates and reduce the amount of waste householders send to landfill.

For years many of you in the waste industry have been trying to shift the attitudes of the rest of us; to try to get people to see waste as a resource, something valuable, not just something to be thrown away. These schemes are getting that message through to people in a far more tangible way than we've seen before.

They bring a real benefit to householders who participate in local recycling schemes. Finally, residents are beginning to cotton on to the value of what they are putting into their bin.

When people see a price tag they are going to stop and think about which bin they are going to use.

These schemes not only educate people, they enable them to make an informed decision to recycle as much as possible. Given the right promotion these incentive schemes can bring householders along with you, rather than leaving them lagging behind. We need to see more of them.

## Conclusion

Localism, the planning system and waste management can work hand in hand to put householders at the centre of waste collection services. The Government is dedicated to promoting these things.

We are doing our bit to help reshape the playing field around the principle of better service. Councils can once again think about how to offer a good weekly collection, improve recycling rates and reduce the amount of waste they send to landfill.

People will instinctively choose to do the right thing and recycle more if we make it a positive experience for them.

Let's keep working together to make that happen and give them the best possible waste service.

_Transcript of the speech as delivered._

### Introduction

I'm a great fan of local government. It is the quickest, fastest most adaptable part of our constitution.

We do live in challenging times. Our country has been left an unsustainable budget deficit and we're facing the shocks everyday of our dear friends in the Eurozone.

> ""Local government is the quickest most adaptable part of our constitution.""

Yet, at every stage, councils have shown their ability to adapt to changing conditions and to just simply get the job done.

This was true for the riots last summer - where councils played a pivotal role helping families and businesses rebuild their lives.

The same is true for the recent flash floods in the Pennines. Local services worked through the night to clear debris, monitor river levels and operate flood defences at numerous locations. But just let one community speak for all of them. In Crawshawbooth, in the centre of the Pennines, residents coming out in the early morning to clean the way so the Olympic Torch could pass with pride 12 hours later.

This civic pride was true for councils taking steps to help hard-working families and pensioners with the cost of living.

Local councils overwhelmingly took up the offer of a second council tax freeze this year, delivering real terms cuts for family bills.

It was also true for troubled families.

You're taking the responsibility to turn around the lives of 120,000 troubled families in double-quick time.

We now have every principal authority across England ready to run programmes in their areas. And that is three or four months in advance of what people thought was possible.

It will help get more kids off the streets and into schools, cut youth crime, as well as putting parents on a path back to work.

So local government has shown its capacity and capability to respond when the situation demands. And in recent days we've had a further example with the response to the tragic explosion in Oldham.

And I know there is a fantastic demand and an ambition to do more, particularly in the field of economic development and pooling of public budgets.

### Powers and freedoms for councils

Last year we passed the Localism Act.

Royal Assent was just the beginning of the process not the end.

> ""The next stage of localism demands that local government takes the lead and grabs power. So don't wait for permission...""

The challenge is implementing the new policies and new powers, and working with communities to help them use these new rights and responsibilities.

The Act's general power of competence is already being used up and down the country every day of the week.

Yet the power of competence gives you the power to innovate and transform.

We scrapped a lot of the mindless bureaucracy, the excessive form-fillings, the clip board culture, that really blighted your lives.

  * Comprehensive Area Assessment - gone
  * Local Area Agreements - gone
  * and we will continue via the Single Data List to scale back Whitehall's unrelenting and unreasonable data reporting demands

We practice what we preach in cutting unnecessary tiers of bureaucracy.

Across my own Department, we are cutting our running costs by 42 per cent.

We've abolished a range of quangos - the likes of the Government Offices for the Regions, to the Tenants Services Authority have now all closed their doors.

And we localised a number more - such as returning Development Corporations back to local government, and handing fire procurement back to the sector.

On Sunday, we finally wave goodbye to the Standards Board regime.

A regime which harmed the reputation of local government. That suppressed freedom of speech and was ineffectual by any measure.

In its place, at its heart, will be local transparency, backed up by criminal sanctions to tackle the genuinely rare cases of corruption in local government.

I can announce today that the transparency regime will include councillors being asked to declare their donations and payments in kind from trade unions.

There is legitimate public concern that if councils are bankrolling trade union pilgrims, they've a right to know who's bankrolling the councillors.

The Standards Board won't be missed.

Neither will the Audit Commission.

When I spoke to you a while ago, I said scrapping the Commission would save £50million a year.

I'm sorry.

I got it completely wrong.

It will actually not save anything like it.

It will actually save £650million over the next five years - with local government keeping the bulk of those savings.

Now it's not just in local governance that we're cutting red tape.

The planning reform is part of that process of reducing unnecessary bureaucracy and devolving power.

It's also a vital driver for growth.

The national planning guidance is now 50 pages, not 1,000 as it previously was.

We are going to do more - such as scaling back thousands more pages of underlying guidance, and implementing the Penfold Review to remove duplicate consent regimes.

This is fundamentally empowering for local councillors - no longer should the process be the preserve of the planning lawyer or NGOs.

Our reforms place a far a greater importance on councils drawing up their Local Plans.

Of course that will be a challenge.

It will mean choices, balancing business growth and the need for more housing, and at the same time, protecting the environment.

In due course, our aim is there won't be Regional Spatial Strategies to hide behind and blame.

But this will be a great opportunity to do what you came into local government to do. To shape, to improve your community.

However, we can't tackle red tape without taking on the bureaucrats from Brussels.

Previous governments have used Brussels directives to piggy-back their pet projects and pretend they've come from over the water.

We need to take out EU gold-plating, from the Kafkaesque procurement regulations to the ERDF regulations which are more obsessed with flying the EU flag than offering value for money.

We live in a fiscal environment where it's all about delivering more for less. We've gone well beyond the need for better value for money.

### Money

Local government accounts for a quarter of all public spending.

Councils have been at the forefront in the last two years in delivering sensible savings whilst protecting the frontline. And you deserve enormous credit for that.

Many central government departments and quangos are now delivering their part of those savings.

To the Siren voices who think we should continue to borrow and spend without restraint, just look at nations on the rocks - nations such as Greece or Italy.

Their failure to tackle their deficits and command the confidence of the markets has resulted in bigger spending cuts being required - much bigger spending cuts in their local government sectors.

By contrast, in Britain, we have already reduced the nation borrowing by more than a quarter of the nation's budget deficit, and interest rates are at a record low, keeping mortgage payments down and helping families with their cost of living.

Local government still spent £118billion in year to April.

New figures today show that capital spending on construction hit a record £14.8billion - the highest level ever.

Of course, eyes are rightly turning to the next Spending Review, as the Local Government Association highlighted earlier this week.

The LGA's message on social care pressures was a powerful one.

I'm sure it strikes a chord with many of us because the decisions we're about to take on social care are probably among the biggest ones you and I are going to take in our lives.

And it's right that it should be at the centre of the Spending Review.

The LGA also highlighted the rising cost of waste.

Waste collection is a perfect example of the dilemmas that councils face in trying to make savings, whilst still providing quality services to their residents.

But it is also a case study in how savings can be made through better procurement, more joint working, incentives and new technology.

Now the last Government actively encouraged councils to make cuts to collections, issue heavy-handed fines and impose new taxes on families.

My department's Weekly Collection Support Scheme is showing there is a different way, whilst still being consistent with the principles of localism.

Last Friday, marked the end of the Outline Bidding Stage. And we have received 166 different bids, in total £430million of funding (for a quarter of a billion pound scheme).

I think it proves my point - that there is massive enthusiasm for better ways of working. For focusing on the service to the customer: the local taxpayer.

### Sensible savings

Now as part of the LGA's response, I looked endlessly at the 'Graph of Doom' analysis that assumes in 20 years we'll be in a difficult position.

A Malthusian crisis in local government.

Yet councils are not passive players. They've already shown this capability of adapting.

Whether it's by collaborating and sharing resources, to reduce in-house management and overhead costs. Or by using technology to improve your services.

The Tri-borough initiative in London is on track to save £40million a year by combining services and management costs. If other authorities simply copied this example, councils could potentially save up to a further £2billion.

I want to know what central government can do to remove obstacles to more joint working and pooling of staff and resources.

For example, I'm already looking into representations made by local government colleagues into what we can do to make it easier to remove chief executive posts, without having to hand out massive payoffs.

But I can't wait to hear the reports of our 14 Community Budget pilots - from Cheshire to Essex on Whole Place and from Bradford Trident to Haverhill on neighbourhoods - pioneering new ways of delivering efficient services and greater local control by joining up funding streams.

Early research shows that a saving of as little as a two per cent equates to over £1billion. This could well be the model for the future.

As John Cridland said to you yesterday, there is still more we can do to improve procurement and share services. This is true for Whitehall and town halls.

Councils are spending £60billion a year procuring goods and services.

The LGA's own programme on collaborative procurement has identified savings of up to 20 per cent in some service areas.

Now my own Department is sharing estates, audit, security and moving other organisations into our head office.

My department's Capital and Asset Pathfinder shows a cross-public sector approach that can lead to savings again of up to 20 per cent.

Now the sheer act of publishing property asset registers online has been an enormous wake up call for many of us in the public sector.

There is no better way of securing our essential services and guaranteeing their quality than transparency.

Indeed, since my department started publishing every single penny of Government Procurement Card spending online, we've been able to cut spending on these corporate credit cards by three-quarters.

The over-use of these flexible friends represents a most massive reputational risk to the public sector.

The sunlight of transparency is the way forward.

Transparency and better procurement complement each other - initiatives like ContractFinder allow you to open up your tenders to a wider audience, especially small firms, and drive down costs at the same time.

I believe the nation's fiscal challenge present us with real opportunities for those with quite a bit of imagination.

Now this week, the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead announced they are to give Nectar points to residents signing up to paying their council tax bills electronically by direct debit.

Something which councils have been trying to encourage for years. Yet innovation and technology can save money for both taxpayer and the council.

My department will be doing our bit, by amending the regulations which hinder electronic billing.

The National Fraud Authority has estimated that councils lose £2 billion a year which could be reduced by cracking down on fraud and improving their prevention, detection and recovery of fraud. So the Local Government Finance Bill is going to increase Councils' incentives to tackle fraud.

### Go for growth

That Local Government Finance Bill is decentralisation, enterprise and promoting economic growth.

> ""Local government remains the friend of progress.""

We know the existing system which prevented councils from retaining their business rates encouraged a begging bowl mentality. So many town halls tried to accentuate the negative, eliminate the positive and definitely messed with Mr In-between.

It was frustrating to see places, many in the North, growing faster than the national average without any reward.

The Bill represents the biggest shake-up to town hall finance in a generation.

By enabling councils to keep 50 per cent of their business rate growth, it will create a new incentive for local government across England to support growth by making your own decisions about local firms and local jobs.

What's more, by having a steady income stream the new rates enable you to borrow against future growth so you can spend more on vital public infrastructure.

We estimate these reforms could boost the economy by £10billion.

I anticipate there will be a massive demand in local government for more. So we will have to balance the need to pay off the nation's budget deficit and also to support deprived and vulnerable councils.

So we're allowing you to keep the proceeds of growth but we're also making sure we give local people the means to create business and jobs. Government can't create jobs from the centre.

You are far better placed to help drive that growth in your local areas. So we've helped you to get on with it through local planning, unringfencing billions of pounds of government grant and through our City Deals - transferring powers to our urban areas. And we will be announcing a full package of City Deals very shortly.

Tax Increment Financing will help lever in new infrastructure, more jobs and more new homes.

Once again you've delivered. We've now got 39 Local Enterprise Partnerships with local businesses covering the whole country.

The South East Local Enterprise Partnership has already identified over 10 projects to receive £38million of Growing Places Fund to create 26,000 jobs and 17,000 new homes.

While Coventry and Warwickshire's Partnership pledged to create 100 apprenticeships in 100 days. And they exceeded their target.

These Partnerships are complemented by our 24 Enterprise Zones.

Now up and running, they are beginning to bring in the business.

Whether it's in Tees Valley - where Omega Plastics and Propipe Limited have moved into units at Hartlepool's Queens Meadow Business Park.

Or in Daresbury - where technology companies are joining their high tech counterparts by moving into Vanguard House, the first Enterprise Zone development at the campus.

These local starts are quickly gaining international recognition.

The Japanese logistics firm Vantec, a subsidiary of Nissan, became the first overseas company to invest £24million in an Enterprise Zone - taking advantage of Sunderland's Enhanced Capital Allowances.

Diamond firm Elements Six is pumping millions into the world's largest synthetic super-materials research and development facility in Science Vale Harwell in Oxfordshire's Enterprise Zone.

And, in the Liverpool area, on the site of the International Trade Centre at Wirral Waters, they've just secured £200million of Chinese investment.

### Conclusion

So this year, since the last LGA conference, has been a year of delivery.

You've adapted.

You're starting to use the new powers and freedoms you now have.

And you've delivered on the ground.

And that's really the point.

Localism relies on local people and local action.

So be bold, be brave, be pushy.

The next stage of localism demands that local government takes the lead and grabs power.

So don't wait for permission - if you do it will almost certainly be too late.

Push until we try to stop you.

Local government remains the friend of progress.

It's the quickest most adaptable part of our constitution.

You, my friends, can deliver for the nation.

### Introduction

> ""India has an unparalleled desire, an unquenchable enthusiasm, an unshakeable belief in the future.""

It's a privilege to be here tonight and to follow such distinguished guest speakers.

Anyone who knows me will know I love India, from India's democracy - the largest in the history of the world - a pillar of stability in an unsettled region, to the music of Ravi Shankar that fills my iPod. Not to mention, of course, India's great cricketing heritage.

And standing here at the home of cricket magical memories of golden summers come flooding back: Kapil Dev striking four consecutive sixes to save the follow on; Rahul Dravid lifting his bat to celebrate a century, engraving his name on the honours board for all time. Like many neutrals I was sad to see India exit the TwentyTwenty World Cup at an early stage. As a long suffering England fan I certainly knew how Indian fans must be feeling.

### India's ambition

Yet there is something else about India that I admire. Something contained in its literature, its mathematics, its music, its films and its sport. Something that its great companies like George's Muthoot Group and golden peacock winners past and present display in abundance. And that is ambition.

India has an unparalleled desire, an unquenchable enthusiasm, an unshakeable belief in the future. It epitomises Gandhi's words to:

> ""Be the change you want to see in the world.""

I first came across that ambition as a youngster growing up in Bradford. I saw how the Indian community was a vibrant, galvanising, positive force that transformed local life.

> ""Britain is the place to be... a place where sustainable companies can strut their stuff.""

Today I see that ambition again in the way the wildfire of economic liberalisation has ignited the Indian economy, spreading growth from city to city, from the fantastic new airports in Bangalore and Hyderabad, to the Bandra-Worli Sea Link in Mumbai and to the metro to Delhi. And it is the tremendous driving force of India's ambition that has set it firmly on the path towards becoming an economic superpower.

### Britain is the land of opportunity

Now there's an old Hindi saying that I believe translates as:

> ""Gone abroad and come home a peacock.""

And for those with ambition Britain is the place to be. This is the land of opportunity - a place where sustainable companies can strut their stuff. We didn't just host an Olympic Games last month, we didn't just create an Olympic stadium - more sustainable than any of its predecessors, we didn't just run the most successful Paralympics ever - at which our very own golden Peacock (Jonnie Peacock) smashed the world 100 metres record. We founded an Olympic legacy.

You will find it ten miles to the east in the blossoming Olympic Park in Stratford. A once desolate wasteland  that now houses new sporting wonders of the world, that stand alongside Westfield - Europe's largest new shopping centre and next to a new tech city.

### Growth across the country

This picture of growth is being replicated right the way across the country, from the Thames Gateway to the Atlantic Gateway, from the Marches to Manchester, from the Solent to Sheffield.

We've taken a leaf out of India's Panchayati Raj system and recognised that we're better off when we take power out of the hands of senior elected representatives and let local communities take charge.

So we've now got Local Enterprise Partnerships - coalitions of local business and local authorities - forming natural economic alliances.

And creating Enterprise Zones - with relaxed planning rules, superfast broadband and generous business rates to fire up their local economies and attract eager inward investors.

Meanwhile, we've let our great cities like Birmingham Liverpool and Nottingham off the leash to renew their industrial might of old and conquer new frontiers in bioscience and advanced manufacturing.

### Building on a great relationship

Now we're proud of our relationship with India, proud that companies of the calibre of our winners today can come here. Proud that Tata's investment in steel production and car manufacture is safeguarding jobs from Teesside to Wolverhampton. Proud that 180 Indian firms invest in our IT sector. Together it's a relationship that brings in £16.8billion a year.

And as someone who loves India, you can only imagine my pleasure at becoming a member of a Government committed to strengthening an already powerful bond.

After all, when times are tough in the Eurozone and the world in general, supporting open markets and free enterprise becomes more important, not less. And supporting the trade, commerce and investment between our two countries is more essential, more valuable, than ever before. So that's why we are expanding our frontline diplomatic staff.

That's why the Prime Minister and Chancellor made a point of visiting within months of taking office, accompanied by many British CEOs. And it is why today you will find British businesses across the land eyeing up the opportunities India is offering. They know that India is looking to invest $1trillion in infrastructure in the years ahead. And having tested their mettle on the biggest infrastructure project in Europe, having worked on projects like Crossrail, they are champing at the bit to help a country whose destiny will be to remould our future.

### Conclusion

Now over in the Olympic Park you will find a great totem to Anglo-Indian ambition, the towering ArcelorMittal Orbit, 115 metres of steel proudly proclaiming that, when it comes to our friendship, the sky is the limit.

And it is my hope to visit India early in the new year, to do absolutely everything I can to realise the enormous promise of our relationship. To help British and Indian companies ruffle some feathers, grasp the burgeoning opportunities out there, and in the coming years bring a pride of golden peacocks home to roost.

_Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version._

In four days time we'll be handing the Olympic flame onto Brazil. But when it leaves, the flame of opportunity, the flame of capability and the flame of progress will remain in the UK. And will continue to burn brightly in this magnificent city of London.

![iframe: ](https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XUawrRfqw_I?start=74;rel=0;showinfo=0)

Over in the Olympic Park are seven new arenas. Seven venues that are cause for wonder - cause for celebration. Not just because they were completed on time and under budget. But because they will enjoy a new lease of life once the Games is over. Either as a sporting venue here or - taken down and reassembled - in another corner of the globe.

And there is an eighth wonder too - the Olympic Park itself. A once barren wasteland brought to full bloom. A place thousands will soon call home. Close by Europe's largest shopping centre. Near the site of a new tech city that will rival Silicon Valley. Crisscrossed by new bridges bringing communities together, and intersected by railway lines linking major business districts to more local people.

Now the spark that lit up the Olympic park has ignited a wildfire of creativity. Spreading eastwards. Illuminating the Thames Gateway. From the new development at South End Airport to the high speed manufacturing plant in Dagenham. From the Enterprise Zone in the fertile heart of the Royal Docks to the revitalised towns of Strand East, Canning Town and Woolwich Central.

It's a transformation that calls to mind a verse from John Dryden, the greatest poet of his day, who more than 300 years ago watched a different London rise like a Phoenix from the embers of a Great Fire that had laid waste to his precious city. And inspired wrote:

> ""Already from this chymic flame
> 
> ""I see a city of more precious mould,
> 
> ""Rich as the town which gives the Indies name,
> 
> ""With silver paved and all divine with gold.""

So there is massive opportunity here to grasp the torch of investment, and to, in the words of John (Armitt not Dryden):

> ""Stretch the moment.""

And, for would be backers, Britain is an investors dream:

  * the easiest place to do business anywhere in Europe;
  * the lowest business tax rates available anywhere in any advanced country;
  * home to the world's best universities;
  * birthplace of the language of business - English.

And it's not like the old days when London was the only town in the game. Growth is spreading its wings right across the country.

We've Local Enterprise Partnerships - local business and local authorities - competing to be the best areas for inward investment.

And we've Enterprise Zones - relaxing planning rules, offering reduced business rates to encourage new investment.

Above all we've got brilliant British construction companies you can partner with. And, if the Olympic Park is a monument to anything it is a monument to their fantastic endeavour.

More than 1600 firms from up and down the land, the cream of our national construction, engineering, architectural and design talent, built 98 per cent of the Park.

They brought us the technical wonder of the Olympic Stadium, with a third of the steel of Beijing's 'Bird's Nest'.

They produced an Olympic Village with the largest grouping of sustainable quality homes anywhere in the country.

They created the remarkable Energy Centre at the Olympic park - a renovated Edwardian sweet factory - whose innovative biomass boilers not only heat every single venue and build in the park at a radically reduced cost to the environment, but will, long after the Games, power new buildings and new communities.

And this well-spring of construction talent is unlikely to run dry any time soon, because to get the Park and village built we trained an army. Of the 46,000 people to have worked on the Olympic Park and Olympic Village, 10 per cent were previously unemployed. We gave them the skills they needed to complete Europe's largest construction project.  
   
And soon the Olympic Park will play host to new universities and new technical institutions so that our British production line will be fed by an inexhaustible tributary of talent far into the future.

Now we're mightily proud of every single one of the construction companies who poured their talent and their time into making these such a fantastic Games. They are true Olympic heroes. And once the Games are over we'll be looking for every opportunity for them to blow their own trumpets.

So these are great days to get in on the British shop floor. Days when we might say as Dryden once said:

> ""The venturous merchant who designed more far,
> 
> ""And touches on our hospitable shore,
> 
> ""Charmed with the splendour of this northern star
> 
> ""Shall here unlade him and depart no more.""

And our would-be investors have still to feast on the possibilities of what's to come

  * Crossrail - Uniting the commercial might of West London with the growing power in the East of the city; and
  * High Speed 2 - The most ambitious national rail project this country has ever seen. Bringing the rest of the country closer than ever to the capital, and to our European and international gateways.

But this isn't just about what you can do for us. It's about what we can do for you. As the Chief Executive* of one large construction company remarked not so long ago:

> ""The Olympics is a fantastic global shop window for British management expertise, design and construction skills, and that expertise can be exported to make other games equally impressive.""

He's spot on.

The one-time owner of our splendid venue today, The Duke of Sutherland, was known as the 'Leviathan of wealth'. And today in our British construction industry there is a new Leviathan; of know-how, of talent, of confidence. Undaunted by the most enormous of tasks, in the shape of its life, charged up and ready to deliver. Any place, any time, anywhere.

So we're looking ahead to see how we can pass the flame of our experience onto Sochi, host city of the next Winter Olympic Games. Onto Brazil, and beyond that onto Korea and Qatar.

And four days from now, when the curtain comes down on the greatest Games ever hosted, we won't feel sad. We will feel excited for there are great days ahead for Great Britain.

Well, it's great to be here to today. Talking about pubs and beer. And I'm in exalted company.

![Pub sign](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2149202.jpg)George & Dragon pub

British historian A.J.P. Taylor thought; 

> ""most of the great men of the past were only there for the beer.""

He appears to have been right.

William Shakespeare said:

> ""A quart of ale is a dish for a king.""

Dr Johnson believed:

> ""There is nothing which has been yet contrived by man, by which so much happiness is produced as by a good tavern or inn.""

And when, in the July election of 1945, Times editor suggested to Winston Churchill that he retire gracefully soon after the campaign… the great man replied;

> ""Mr. Editor, I leave when the pub closes.""

All these patrons knew what we know. That what we drink and where we drink tells us who we are. And nothing says Britain more than our Great British pub and our Great British beer.

They are part of a tradition dating back to ancient times. Beer was drunk in the taverns of Roman England. In the Anglo-Saxon alehouse. In the inns of the Middle Age.

> ""The 'local' is the beating heart of our communities""

Before I came here today I did a bit of a pub crawl - online of course. It turns out that within a one mile radius of this building there are more than 400 pubs. And their names might as well be chapters from a history of Britain.

  * Boadicea
  * Shakespeare
  * George and the Dragon
  * Silver Cross
  * Battle of Trafalgar

And it's curious how history reflected in a pint glass, is history brought sharply into focus.

We can almost see Samuel Pepys witnessing the Great Fire of London in 1666 from ""a little alehouse on Bankside"".

Doctor Johnson penning his famous Dictionary at The Anchor in Southwark.

Dirty Den handing Anj the divorce papers on a Christmas night in the Queen Vic.

And Bet Lynch leaving the Rovers Return for the last time.

But while pubs are tied to our past they are equally an essential part of our present.

We call it the 'local' because it is the beating heart of our communities.

The place we gather.

> to socialise  
to celebrate  
to commiserate  
to champion and to cherish our way of life

But I'm not going to get all misty eyed today.

> ""Pubs and beer mean business.""

Pub and beer mean business. And a heady mix of the worlds best beer and the world's best brewers…

> …a potent cocktail of our famous beer companies  
…our industrious family brewers  
…our innovative microbreweries…  
...have made this industry a colossus.

The facts speak for themselves.

Individually, according to the British Beer and Pub Association, each pub contributes an estimated £80,000 to its local economy. Collectively, they contribute over £19 billion to the national economy. And in total they're sustaining nearly 900,000 jobs.

That's why for all their historical and cultural significance, our pubs must be a vital part of our economic future.

Now it's been a tough few years for your industry. But we're not abandoning the local to its fate.

We've made sure small business rate relief - which we've doubled until the end of March next year - and rural rate relief are available to our public houses.

We're distilled rules on weights and measures for intoxicating liquor into simplified form.

And we're canning sales of alcohol below cost-price by supermarkets. Most pubs should experience the benefit of this minimum unit price.

And we're even making it far easier for you to play live music at your venues. Taking away the usual licensing rules from performances where the audience numbers 200 or fewer. We want people to make a song and a dance. But, in the pub, not over the paperwork.

These reforms will, I hope be the fillip the industry needs as we look forward to a summer of royal and sporting celebration. A triple whammy of festivity. The Diamond Jubilee, Olympics, the European Championship. Events that will have punters across the world beating a path to your door.

Now I want to make sure I do everything I can to make sure you're in the shape of your life in the coming months.

But this isn't just about me. It's about you too.

It's an open secret that, over the past few years, pub companies and licensees haven't always seen eye to eye.

A fact reflected in the Government's Select Committee report on pub companies last year.

Now we take your concerns about regulation very seriously. And we've listened. That's why we've got self-regulation not central regulation.

But make no mistake. This is about you grasping the nettle.

I can see there have been a lot of improvements;

  * a strengthened industry code
  * greater transparency
  * a new arbitration and mediation service

All good work. But don't expect me to pat you on the back just yet.

Now's the time to make good on your promise. Go further. Go faster. Do what you need to do to convince the doubters things have changed.

You need to put your house in order. Otherwise you might find the dead hand of Whitehall feeling your collar.

Now I started out by saying pubs are at the heart of local communities. I'd like to finish with a nod to our work on community pubs.

In the past few years we've seen local people coming forward to save their local.

The Rookhope Inn in Weardale was rescued by Sunderland-based charity St Aidan's Community Trust.

When the town of Hesket Newmarket faced losing their local, they didn't get bitter, they got bolder.

Now they are running it themselves.

My Cabinet colleague William Hague is one of almost 200 members to have rescued the only pub in the small North Yorkshire village of Hudswell.

  * [Hudswell community pub - transcript](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/newsroom/word/1867361.doc)

MS Word, 25 kb, 2 pages

In my constituency a couple of pals didn't save a pub. They built a brewery.

The founders of the Brentwood Brewing Company said:

> ""We tasted a pint, thought that's not brilliant - we can do better than this!""

But Community Right to Bid means help is on tap. It requires local authorities to keep a record of their valuable community assets.

When they come up for sale, the community can call for a six month time out.

Prepare a bid.

Organise a whip round.

And save their pub from extinction.

But let's be honest. Saving a pub is one thing. Running it is something else.

The community spirited pub owner can often find themselves dealing less with a going concern. Than a growing concern. Once the scales fall from their eyes they find themselves facing more bureaucratic barriers than an Olympic hurdler.

Over the past couple of years we've had what we've called, in Government circles, the Red Tape Challenge.

This is starting to make headway in hacking through a forest of regulation, for example, in regard to the hospitality industry. Some of which will clearly have a bearing on you.

But in the coming months we will also be casting our eye over the community pub sector to see if there are other areas where we can wield the red tape axe.

We need to make sure folk with a bit of get up and go don't have all their enthusiasm watered down by a ministry of meddlers.

So we're taking action to help the pub industry. Helping those who run community pubs.

Acting because pubs and brewing play a unique role in our lives. They are part of the warp and woof of our country.

And we're determined to make sure they remain at the heart of our nation long into our future.

_Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version._

Those who know me will know I love India, a country I have visited many times. A country that inspires in me the same sort of awe that impelled a spellbound Mark Twain to write of:

> ""...that cradle of the human race, birthplace of human speech, mother of history, grandmother of legend, great-grandmother of traditions…
> 
> ""...the one land that all men desire to see, and having seen once, by even a glimpse, would not give that glimpse for the shows of all the rest of the world combined.""

But it is not merely India's great ancient spirit that captivates me. A spirit that has shaped the religious, literary and intellectual lives. Of billions of people, generation after generation. What beguiles me about India is its extraordinary vitality, its youthful exuberance. Unshackled by the past. Unwilling to build its future on the shifting sands of yesterday. It has eyes only for the future.

Indira Ghandi once said:

> ""There are two kinds of people. Those who do the work and those who take the credit.""

India has only ever been interested in being the former category. Only ever interested in listening to the drumbeat of ideas. The drumbeat of education. The drumbeat of innovation.

And everywhere you look in modern India today you will see new totems of progress. The airports in Bangalore and in Hyderabad. The Bandra-Worli Sea link in Mumbai. The metro in Delhi.

In Britain we are firmly set on the self-same sea of progress. Not far from here in East London the world is gripped by another sporting extravaganza. Wheelchairs revving. Blades buzzing. Paralympians like India's Girisha [Hosanagara Nagarajegowda], reaching Olympian heights and grabbing medals.

Yet a few years back there were no new sporting wonders of the world. No pristine park to entertain sporting royalty. Just 300 acres of deserted wasteland. It took British skill, British expertise, British ambition, to turn Stratford into a place fit to host the Olympian spirit.

And we're pressing on. Pushing progress as far as it will go. From the Thames estuary to the Atlantic gateway. Our Local Enterprise Partnerships now span England, creating new zones of economic influence, offering ever more internationally competitive technological readiness and business sophistication. Freezing business rates and relaxing planning rules to attract the investor's wandering eye.

So Britain and India are fellow travellers. Sharing the same desire to progress. The same entrepreneurial drive. The same ambition. And that's why we want to see our relationship blossom. Currently our trade relationship is worth £16.8billion a year. Fine for a partnership of economic convenience, but not for those of us who desire a marriage of ambition.

And were the genie to offer me two wishes, I would wish firstly to see more Indian businesses, more companies like Tata, coming over here to take advantage of one of the best business climates in the world. Making the most of the brands, the creativity and technology that only Britain has to offer

And secondly I would wish to see more Indian companies turning to British expertise to help feed that economic tiger. Turning Indian plans for $1trillion of investment in infrastructure into concrete reality.

Already our relationship is maturing. Exports to India were up 40 per cent last year, while UK companies announced £9billion of investment in India.

But forget those figures for a moment. For evidence of what our two great nations can achieve together you need only shift your gaze across the London skyline to the Olympic Park. Where a brave new steel sculpture soars above our grand new sporting amphitheatres. Those modern day wonders of the world.

At 377 feet, the ArcelorMittal Orbit is Britain's tallest sculpture. But it is also much more - designed by Anish Kapoor, funded by Lakshmi Mittal - it is a structure celebrating Anglo-Indian ingenuity. A symbol proudly proclaiming Britain and India's determination to reach for the stars. And a sign, above all, of marvellous things to come for our two great countries.

_Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version._

Thank you for, once again, inviting me to speak at your annual conference. So much has happened in the last twelve months and I am privileged to have the opportunity to update you today on what we have been doing.

## Creating markets to support the growth agenda

The waste industry plays an important role in promoting local - and green - growth. Last year, local authority waste management contributed around £3.3 billion. This is a significant sum of money and its impact on the British economy should not be underestimated.

But it is not just an important growth industry, it is a vital service. Millions of people rely on it to take away their daily build up household waste.

It is the one service people know they get for their £120 a month in council tax. We can't lose sight of that. The vast majority of people are grateful for that service.

Much of this is down to people in this room and I would like to thank you all for your contribution. Without it this country would be a lot less pleasant a place to live.

## Localism

Many of the changes we have brought about in the last year are evidence of localism in action. We are giving local authorities and their residents a greater say in how their rubbish and recycling services are delivered.

We have brought about a 360 degree turn in how waste collections are thought about. Instead of a crime and punishment approach we want a system that focuses on the best possible service. Where it is easier for the council and the householders to do the right thing.

Where councils promote rewards and incentives, new technology, more joint working and better procurement, to support weekly rubbish and recycling collections.

We are supporting that aim by consigning bin taxes to the dustbin of history.

Since the start of the year no council can charge families - the people they serve - for overfilling their bin or introduce extra tariffs for taking away household waste. Pay as you throw is not the right way to improve collections.

Fortnightly collections are unpopular and unhygienic.

It's the traditional weekly bin round that people want to see. We have got rid of the Audit Commission guidance that started the shift to fortnightly pick ups. Councils will no longer be marked down for offering that service.

To help with the transition back to weekly collections we have put £250 million on the table through our Weekly Collection Support Scheme so that councils can reinstate, or retain weekly waste collections, alongside improving environmental benefits like improved recycling rates or greater cost effectiveness.

Householders will no longer face the threat of a £1,000 fine or a criminal conviction for mistakenly putting a yogurt pot in the wrong bin or leaving it out a little too long.

This Government knows that bin fines were the wrong way to go. So they are being abolished. Step one was to reduce the level of the fine to an acceptable level. It was ridiculous that someone who made a simple mistake like putting something in the wrong bin could be fined more than a shoplifter.

Next we will introduce a 'harm to local amenity' test so appropriate action can be taken against fly-tippers and consistent offenders, but not ordinary householders.

Localism is integral to boosting recycling and improving waste management, because it is about strengthened local accountability.

At the heart of our agenda, is the wish to see citizens able to hold their councils to account, for the services that they receive.

The Localism Act supports investment in infrastructure and recognises the pivotal role planning contributes to delivering and maintaining appropriate and effective waste facilities. We have made it easier for citizens to engage with and shape the impact of planning decisions in their local area.

This will help them engage more constructively on where to locate waste facilities.

## Weekly Collection Support Scheme

We launched our Weekly Collection Support Scheme in February this year.

The bids we have received show that there is significant scope for councils to increase recycling rates and improve a frontline service without cutting the frequency of collections.

As you know outline bids had to be sent in by last month and I am pleased to say that we received 166 bids. More than many people expected. There are a range of proposals including infrastructure projects and incentive schemes.

We are getting ready to give those bidders bespoke feedback later this month.

This will help local authorities as they seek to finalise and improve their bids in time for the final bids deadline of 17 August 2012.

In so many areas local authorities have ignored their residents' needs and chosen to cut bin collections; this Scheme encourages local authorities to keep householder interests at the heart of their waste collection service, where they belong.

Any savings must also lead to service improvements otherwise councils are just getting paid to provide a worse service. It will let councils make decisions for their people not their budgets. This is the principle at the heart of localism. Serve the people, rather than the Government.

Sutton Borough Council get this. They are listening. They consulted their local people through open houses and an online forum on the quality, frequency, and costs of bin collections as part of a drive to save a million pounds, or 25 per cent of their waste budget.

As a result Sutton is renewing its commitment to weekly collections of household waste. They found the savings by using new technology to improve collection routes that allowed them more flexible shift patterns.

Local authorities and their residents deserve to choose the service that they receive.

Councils have chosen to bid and I am delighted that so many have taken up the offer.

We have not prescribed how councils go about delivering a weekly collection service, but will favour councils being innovative or tailoring their services to local needs. There is no 'one size fits all' solution to a good, high quality waste collection service. They need to be bespoke. To fit each specific circumstance.

We are also making the money easily available: successful bidders can choose a 'one off payment' or spread it over (up to) three years.

Innovative councils will also embrace this opportunity to invest in more sustainable waste management options - such as increased recycling and smarter procurement deals.

For example, Sandwell has kept a weekly bin collection service and, at the same time, taken huge steps to boost recycling. Their partnership with Serco means that by 2020 Sandwell will be recycling or composting at least 60 per cent of household rubbish. The majority of the remainder will be turned into renewable energy leaving less than five per cent going to expensive landfill.

Thanks to increased recycling, an estimated £300 million savings will be made over 25 years.

And Portsmouth City Council are working with Biffa Waste Services to deliver weekly pick ups to over 200,000 residents in the city.

They'll save £1 million per year, reduce CO2 emissions and have new software technology.

Other local authorities should learn from this and use the Scheme to develop new, better, ways of working.

## Partnership Proposals

Lord Taylor spoke about the importance of partnership working yesterday and I would like to reiterate that message and highlight the importance of public-private partnerships.

The close co-operation of local authorities and industry with local communities will help find the right solution for each place that puts the householder at the centre of the service while meeting our recycling targets and providing even greater value for money for the council tax payer.

## Planning

I've already touched briefly on planning. It goes hand in hand with localism. Planning plays a pivotal role in delivering new waste management facilities that improve services and help move waste up the waste hierarchy. But, as I said, they can be very unpopular neighbours.

As you will know, we did not think that the previous planning system was working. It was too adversarial and too complex. And too few plans were coming forward. That is why we are reforming the planning system.

It is important local people see the direct benefits of the facilities needed to provide the waste services that they want. So that rather than having to go through the courts trying to impose on them, as was done before, communities will welcome them.

Together the Localism Act and the National Planning Policy Framework are reinforcing our localist approach. Decisions are being taken by those who know their areas best. It firmly places communities at the heart of decision making. It decentralises the power and responsibility to shape places out of Whitehall.

It also enshrines the Local Plan and confirms that planning should focus on local needs, empowering local people to shape their surroundings, setting out a positive vision for the future of their area.

And whilst there is a transition period of 12 months for those local authorities that have recently adopted a Local Plan, my advice to all councils is to press ahead and ensure they have an up-to-date plan in place at the earliest opportunity.

## Influencing behaviours

We want to see more householders recycling. We don't want them to live in fear of being caught accidentally doing the wrong thing or feeling like they have been coerced into recycling. We want to enable residents to make well-informed decisions and choose to recycle. We want them to understand the benefits that recycling brings - both environmental and economic.

Reward schemes like Recyclebank and Local Green Points are already being successfully used to encourage residents to increase recycling rates and reduce the amount of waste householders send to landfill.

For years many of you in the waste industry have been trying to shift the attitudes of the rest of us; to try to get people to see waste as a resource, something valuable, not just something to be thrown away. These schemes are getting that message through to people in a far more tangible way than we've seen before.

They bring a real benefit to householders who participate in local recycling schemes. Finally, residents are beginning to cotton on to the value of what they are putting into their bin.

When people see a price tag they are going to stop and think about which bin they are going to use.

These schemes not only educate people, they enable them to make an informed decision to recycle as much as possible. Given the right promotion these incentive schemes can bring householders along with you, rather than leaving them lagging behind. We need to see more of them.

## Conclusion

Localism, the planning system and waste management can work hand in hand to put householders at the centre of waste collection services. The Government is dedicated to promoting these things.

We are doing our bit to help reshape the playing field around the principle of better service. Councils can once again think about how to offer a good weekly collection, improve recycling rates and reduce the amount of waste they send to landfill.

People will instinctively choose to do the right thing and recycle more if we make it a positive experience for them.

Let's keep working together to make that happen and give them the best possible waste service.

_Transcript of the speech as delivered._

### Introduction

I'm a great fan of local government. It is the quickest, fastest most adaptable part of our constitution.

We do live in challenging times. Our country has been left an unsustainable budget deficit and we're facing the shocks everyday of our dear friends in the Eurozone.

> ""Local government is the quickest most adaptable part of our constitution.""

Yet, at every stage, councils have shown their ability to adapt to changing conditions and to just simply get the job done.

This was true for the riots last summer - where councils played a pivotal role helping families and businesses rebuild their lives.

The same is true for the recent flash floods in the Pennines. Local services worked through the night to clear debris, monitor river levels and operate flood defences at numerous locations. But just let one community speak for all of them. In Crawshawbooth, in the centre of the Pennines, residents coming out in the early morning to clean the way so the Olympic Torch could pass with pride 12 hours later.

This civic pride was true for councils taking steps to help hard-working families and pensioners with the cost of living.

Local councils overwhelmingly took up the offer of a second council tax freeze this year, delivering real terms cuts for family bills.

It was also true for troubled families.

You're taking the responsibility to turn around the lives of 120,000 troubled families in double-quick time.

We now have every principal authority across England ready to run programmes in their areas. And that is three or four months in advance of what people thought was possible.

It will help get more kids off the streets and into schools, cut youth crime, as well as putting parents on a path back to work.

So local government has shown its capacity and capability to respond when the situation demands. And in recent days we've had a further example with the response to the tragic explosion in Oldham.

And I know there is a fantastic demand and an ambition to do more, particularly in the field of economic development and pooling of public budgets.

### Powers and freedoms for councils

Last year we passed the Localism Act.

Royal Assent was just the beginning of the process not the end.

> ""The next stage of localism demands that local government takes the lead and grabs power. So don't wait for permission...""

The challenge is implementing the new policies and new powers, and working with communities to help them use these new rights and responsibilities.

The Act's general power of competence is already being used up and down the country every day of the week.

Yet the power of competence gives you the power to innovate and transform.

We scrapped a lot of the mindless bureaucracy, the excessive form-fillings, the clip board culture, that really blighted your lives.

  * Comprehensive Area Assessment - gone
  * Local Area Agreements - gone
  * and we will continue via the Single Data List to scale back Whitehall's unrelenting and unreasonable data reporting demands

We practice what we preach in cutting unnecessary tiers of bureaucracy.

Across my own Department, we are cutting our running costs by 42 per cent.

We've abolished a range of quangos - the likes of the Government Offices for the Regions, to the Tenants Services Authority have now all closed their doors.

And we localised a number more - such as returning Development Corporations back to local government, and handing fire procurement back to the sector.

On Sunday, we finally wave goodbye to the Standards Board regime.

A regime which harmed the reputation of local government. That suppressed freedom of speech and was ineffectual by any measure.

In its place, at its heart, will be local transparency, backed up by criminal sanctions to tackle the genuinely rare cases of corruption in local government.

I can announce today that the transparency regime will include councillors being asked to declare their donations and payments in kind from trade unions.

There is legitimate public concern that if councils are bankrolling trade union pilgrims, they've a right to know who's bankrolling the councillors.

The Standards Board won't be missed.

Neither will the Audit Commission.

When I spoke to you a while ago, I said scrapping the Commission would save £50million a year.

I'm sorry.

I got it completely wrong.

It will actually not save anything like it.

It will actually save £650million over the next five years - with local government keeping the bulk of those savings.

Now it's not just in local governance that we're cutting red tape.

The planning reform is part of that process of reducing unnecessary bureaucracy and devolving power.

It's also a vital driver for growth.

The national planning guidance is now 50 pages, not 1,000 as it previously was.

We are going to do more - such as scaling back thousands more pages of underlying guidance, and implementing the Penfold Review to remove duplicate consent regimes.

This is fundamentally empowering for local councillors - no longer should the process be the preserve of the planning lawyer or NGOs.

Our reforms place a far a greater importance on councils drawing up their Local Plans.

Of course that will be a challenge.

It will mean choices, balancing business growth and the need for more housing, and at the same time, protecting the environment.

In due course, our aim is there won't be Regional Spatial Strategies to hide behind and blame.

But this will be a great opportunity to do what you came into local government to do. To shape, to improve your community.

However, we can't tackle red tape without taking on the bureaucrats from Brussels.

Previous governments have used Brussels directives to piggy-back their pet projects and pretend they've come from over the water.

We need to take out EU gold-plating, from the Kafkaesque procurement regulations to the ERDF regulations which are more obsessed with flying the EU flag than offering value for money.

We live in a fiscal environment where it's all about delivering more for less. We've gone well beyond the need for better value for money.

### Money

Local government accounts for a quarter of all public spending.

Councils have been at the forefront in the last two years in delivering sensible savings whilst protecting the frontline. And you deserve enormous credit for that.

Many central government departments and quangos are now delivering their part of those savings.

To the Siren voices who think we should continue to borrow and spend without restraint, just look at nations on the rocks - nations such as Greece or Italy.

Their failure to tackle their deficits and command the confidence of the markets has resulted in bigger spending cuts being required - much bigger spending cuts in their local government sectors.

By contrast, in Britain, we have already reduced the nation borrowing by more than a quarter of the nation's budget deficit, and interest rates are at a record low, keeping mortgage payments down and helping families with their cost of living.

Local government still spent £118billion in year to April.

New figures today show that capital spending on construction hit a record £14.8billion - the highest level ever.

Of course, eyes are rightly turning to the next Spending Review, as the Local Government Association highlighted earlier this week.

The LGA's message on social care pressures was a powerful one.

I'm sure it strikes a chord with many of us because the decisions we're about to take on social care are probably among the biggest ones you and I are going to take in our lives.

And it's right that it should be at the centre of the Spending Review.

The LGA also highlighted the rising cost of waste.

Waste collection is a perfect example of the dilemmas that councils face in trying to make savings, whilst still providing quality services to their residents.

But it is also a case study in how savings can be made through better procurement, more joint working, incentives and new technology.

Now the last Government actively encouraged councils to make cuts to collections, issue heavy-handed fines and impose new taxes on families.

My department's Weekly Collection Support Scheme is showing there is a different way, whilst still being consistent with the principles of localism.

Last Friday, marked the end of the Outline Bidding Stage. And we have received 166 different bids, in total £430million of funding (for a quarter of a billion pound scheme).

I think it proves my point - that there is massive enthusiasm for better ways of working. For focusing on the service to the customer: the local taxpayer.

### Sensible savings

Now as part of the LGA's response, I looked endlessly at the 'Graph of Doom' analysis that assumes in 20 years we'll be in a difficult position.

A Malthusian crisis in local government.

Yet councils are not passive players. They've already shown this capability of adapting.

Whether it's by collaborating and sharing resources, to reduce in-house management and overhead costs. Or by using technology to improve your services.

The Tri-borough initiative in London is on track to save £40million a year by combining services and management costs. If other authorities simply copied this example, councils could potentially save up to a further £2billion.

I want to know what central government can do to remove obstacles to more joint working and pooling of staff and resources.

For example, I'm already looking into representations made by local government colleagues into what we can do to make it easier to remove chief executive posts, without having to hand out massive payoffs.

But I can't wait to hear the reports of our 14 Community Budget pilots - from Cheshire to Essex on Whole Place and from Bradford Trident to Haverhill on neighbourhoods - pioneering new ways of delivering efficient services and greater local control by joining up funding streams.

Early research shows that a saving of as little as a two per cent equates to over £1billion. This could well be the model for the future.

As John Cridland said to you yesterday, there is still more we can do to improve procurement and share services. This is true for Whitehall and town halls.

Councils are spending £60billion a year procuring goods and services.

The LGA's own programme on collaborative procurement has identified savings of up to 20 per cent in some service areas.

Now my own Department is sharing estates, audit, security and moving other organisations into our head office.

My department's Capital and Asset Pathfinder shows a cross-public sector approach that can lead to savings again of up to 20 per cent.

Now the sheer act of publishing property asset registers online has been an enormous wake up call for many of us in the public sector.

There is no better way of securing our essential services and guaranteeing their quality than transparency.

Indeed, since my department started publishing every single penny of Government Procurement Card spending online, we've been able to cut spending on these corporate credit cards by three-quarters.

The over-use of these flexible friends represents a most massive reputational risk to the public sector.

The sunlight of transparency is the way forward.

Transparency and better procurement complement each other - initiatives like ContractFinder allow you to open up your tenders to a wider audience, especially small firms, and drive down costs at the same time.

I believe the nation's fiscal challenge present us with real opportunities for those with quite a bit of imagination.

Now this week, the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead announced they are to give Nectar points to residents signing up to paying their council tax bills electronically by direct debit.

Something which councils have been trying to encourage for years. Yet innovation and technology can save money for both taxpayer and the council.

My department will be doing our bit, by amending the regulations which hinder electronic billing.

The National Fraud Authority has estimated that councils lose £2 billion a year which could be reduced by cracking down on fraud and improving their prevention, detection and recovery of fraud. So the Local Government Finance Bill is going to increase Councils' incentives to tackle fraud.

### Go for growth

That Local Government Finance Bill is decentralisation, enterprise and promoting economic growth.

> ""Local government remains the friend of progress.""

We know the existing system which prevented councils from retaining their business rates encouraged a begging bowl mentality. So many town halls tried to accentuate the negative, eliminate the positive and definitely messed with Mr In-between.

It was frustrating to see places, many in the North, growing faster than the national average without any reward.

The Bill represents the biggest shake-up to town hall finance in a generation.

By enabling councils to keep 50 per cent of their business rate growth, it will create a new incentive for local government across England to support growth by making your own decisions about local firms and local jobs.

What's more, by having a steady income stream the new rates enable you to borrow against future growth so you can spend more on vital public infrastructure.

We estimate these reforms could boost the economy by £10billion.

I anticipate there will be a massive demand in local government for more. So we will have to balance the need to pay off the nation's budget deficit and also to support deprived and vulnerable councils.

So we're allowing you to keep the proceeds of growth but we're also making sure we give local people the means to create business and jobs. Government can't create jobs from the centre.

You are far better placed to help drive that growth in your local areas. So we've helped you to get on with it through local planning, unringfencing billions of pounds of government grant and through our City Deals - transferring powers to our urban areas. And we will be announcing a full package of City Deals very shortly.

Tax Increment Financing will help lever in new infrastructure, more jobs and more new homes.

Once again you've delivered. We've now got 39 Local Enterprise Partnerships with local businesses covering the whole country.

The South East Local Enterprise Partnership has already identified over 10 projects to receive £38million of Growing Places Fund to create 26,000 jobs and 17,000 new homes.

While Coventry and Warwickshire's Partnership pledged to create 100 apprenticeships in 100 days. And they exceeded their target.

These Partnerships are complemented by our 24 Enterprise Zones.

Now up and running, they are beginning to bring in the business.

Whether it's in Tees Valley - where Omega Plastics and Propipe Limited have moved into units at Hartlepool's Queens Meadow Business Park.

Or in Daresbury - where technology companies are joining their high tech counterparts by moving into Vanguard House, the first Enterprise Zone development at the campus.

These local starts are quickly gaining international recognition.

The Japanese logistics firm Vantec, a subsidiary of Nissan, became the first overseas company to invest £24million in an Enterprise Zone - taking advantage of Sunderland's Enhanced Capital Allowances.

Diamond firm Elements Six is pumping millions into the world's largest synthetic super-materials research and development facility in Science Vale Harwell in Oxfordshire's Enterprise Zone.

And, in the Liverpool area, on the site of the International Trade Centre at Wirral Waters, they've just secured £200million of Chinese investment.

### Conclusion

So this year, since the last LGA conference, has been a year of delivery.

You've adapted.

You're starting to use the new powers and freedoms you now have.

And you've delivered on the ground.

And that's really the point.

Localism relies on local people and local action.

So be bold, be brave, be pushy.

The next stage of localism demands that local government takes the lead and grabs power.

So don't wait for permission - if you do it will almost certainly be too late.

Push until we try to stop you.

Local government remains the friend of progress.

It's the quickest most adaptable part of our constitution.

You, my friends, can deliver for the nation.

_Transcript of the speech as delivered._

#### Introduction - working together

Thank you for that introduction.

Tonight I should like to speak briefly and specifically about how we can increase the supply of homes.

I do so, in one sense as the most dangerous type of Ministers (my civil servants will take that view!), namely someone who has a little knowledge of what he is talking about!

As a Chartered Surveyor, I feel I have some understanding of the housing and the construction markets. But I come to this role knowing that frankly I still have much to learn, particularly about the social housing sector.

So let me start by saying that I want to listen. The expertise when I look gathered here around the room is one I intend not to ignore. Indeed it's experience which I value. There will be times when we won't always agree, but if we work together, we can make a real difference.

#### Government's role

As a Government we are already setting the direction.

Last November, we established the Housing Strategy as our long term framework for future action.

In the Spring, we introduced a series of key policies, including for example New Buy, which has the capability of helping up to 100,000 people.

And just two weeks ago, a day after I was in post, we set out a comprehensive set of measures to accelerate progress. Those measures include:

  * Building up to another 15,000 new affordable homes and bringing an extra 5,000 empty homes back into use;
  * Putting an additional £280 million into FirstBuy - so around 27,000 will now be able to buy their first home; and
  * Confirming Government Guarantees of up to £10 billion, for the development of many more new rented homes.

Now, these guarantees in particular have the potential to galvanise the sector. And it shows that, despite inheriting an enormous deficit, this Government is absolutely committed to providing the policies and resources needed to build the homes people want.

These new measures build on the £1.3 billion that is already working to unlock stalled housing schemes, and the Affordable Homes Programme of £19.5 billion, which we are confident, will deliver up to 170,000 new affordable homes.

Taken together with our reforms to the planning system and the rented sectors, these policies represent the best way to improve our housing provision in both the short and longer term.

#### Challenge

But, tonight, if I may, I would also like to issue a challenge.

I said earlier that I value your collected expertise and capability. Many of the organisations represented here provide a wide range of innovative social housing, and good services to existing tenants.   But I think you can do more.

There's a great opportunity to use your experience to develop more homes and serving a much wider group of people.

Housing associations are after all good at tailoring services that respect very different housing needs. Affordable home ownership is a good example.

I've seen the work of London and Quadrant on the former Olympic Park where they are already developing affordable homes for both rent and purchase.

And just last week Thames Valley launched their Fizzy Living scheme to prospective private tenants.

So what I'd like to challenge you all to think about is how you can develop homes for a much wider group of people, in different ways, and perhaps in different tenures.

We will help, not least through our newly announced housing guarantees; and the £200 million equity finance fund, so take it from me that we want you to be bold.

#### Clarity and stability for sector

As a former businessman I do, however, understand that for you to be innovative, you need longer term certainty about the market you work in and the direction of government policy.

This is especially true when it comes to the future of finance for affordable homes and the specific direction of policy on rents and policy reaching beyond the current spending review period.

Now on this, my ninth working day in the job, I can't set out for you the full detail for the next three years. But let me be clear:

  * I understand why you need that certainty;
  * I intend to address this longer term framework;
  * I want to do so working with you and others so we get it right.

#### True value of social housing

As a former Business Minister, I also know about the economic value of your sector: the ability to drive local growth.

Most people understand the social role of housing, whether owned, or rented, whether private or public.

And I strongly believe that housing is not merely about bricks and mortar. All of us need a home, somewhere we can call our own, somewhere that families can be secure and where children can grow.

And I shall want to address those social issues, whether it is the scourge of neighbours from hell, or the plight of the homeless.

However, increasing the housing supply, especially of affordable homes, also has an important economic purpose. One in which you and the organisations you represent have a vital role.

Building affordable homes, when you look at the bare statistics, is a great economic multiplier - and your buying power can help sustain local businesses.

You also provide jobs and help tackle worklessness. Thousands of young people have benefited from apprenticeships with construction companies on affordable housing projects.

And let me also to say to you that it doesn't matter how small your organisation is.  Indeed many of the smaller organisations are at the cutting edge of community activism, successfully using the new community rights that this Government has introduced.

It's about giving local people a say as to what goes on in their community - whether that's deciding where new homes are built, or how affordable housing is managed, this role is really important.   

So, while the issue of building new affordable homes is clearly front and centre - I also want to say that I recognise the vital role you play in helping to protect the homeless, the vulnerable and the marginalised in society.

#### Conclusion

So, Ladies and Gentlemen, we're putting in place a comprehensive set of measures to help this sector adapt and grow.

Of course, there are significant challenges, but as a Government we are determined to work with you to address both the short term symptoms and the long term causes.

That's why we're:

  * Providing our multi billion pound guarantees to help lever in new investment;
  * Removing the planning and financial barriers that are holding back the housing market; and
  * Developing a clear direction to help increase the supply of all forms of housing, owned or rented, public or private.

I think the package really has the opportunity to make a real difference and I am looking forward to working with you.

Overcoming the problems before us won't be easy.  But then, nothing worthwhile ever is.

Thank you.

_Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version._

In one week's time the Jewish community will be celebrating Rosh Hashanah. Both the Jewish New Year and a Day of Remembrance. But when it comes to the Holocaust the duty of remembrance falls on us all.

Remembrance is not to be confused with memory. Remembrance is the conscious effort: to step into somebody else's shoes; to light a candle for the generation that has gone before; to cast light on the millions of lives snuffed out; to illuminate the lost byways, the forgotten streets, the villages ransacked of life and laughter.

Remembrance fills the void statistics leaves behind. It tells us who was the mother, the father, the daughter, the son. It helps us imagine who might have lit up their community. Who might have become the next Einstein, or the next Ludgwig Guttman. The Jewish refugee from Nazism who founded the fantastic Paralympics.

And there is no better aid to remembrance than education. So I want to pay tribute to the Holocaust Educational Trust for your work. It makes me proud to think, almost a quarter of a century on from your founding by Lord Janner and the late Lord Rees, that you continue to shine a light into history's darkest recesses. To provide teaching resources to classrooms and campuses.To send out hugely impressive volunteers. Not just to speak of the unimaginable depths of human suffering. But - since some of those volunteers are also survivors - to bear witness to the illimitable strength of the human spirit.

And, of course, the Trust continues to send young people to witness despair's cul de sac at Auschwitz Birkenau. Having made that journey myself I know it never leaves you. Nor the chill of realising that destructive hate could strike, not in some medieval dark age, but in our modern world. In the cradle of our Western civilisation. In the birthplace of Durer, Kant and Shiller.

Now the man who pioneered these one day visits to Auschwitz was Rabbi Barry Marcus. And he has been a constant on every single visit over the past 13 years. In that time he has met some 17000 students and teachers. To each he poses the same searching question. Not - where was God in Auschwitz - but where was man? It is a profound challenge that forces us to confront Primo Levi's terrible truth that:

> ""It happened, therefore it can happen again"".

Because Holocaust remembrance is never just about the past, it is a shofar blast to us here today. A shofar blast against prejudice. A shofar blast against discrimination. A shofar blast that would deny hate any sanctuary, any refuge, any hiding place. So future generations might walk our streets without fear.

Recently one six former returning from a trip to Auschwitz said:

> ""This experience will affect me for the rest of my life, and I will try to use it to remind myself and others how extremely dangerous prejudices can be.""

That is why we continue supporting Holocaust remembrance and visits to Auschwitz. And why it is now my privilege and pleasure to present Rabbi Marcus - scion of Talmudic nobility - with an honour of his own. A small token of thanks for his immense contribution not just to the Jewish community but to our wider society.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/speeches/newsroom/firesummit2012,Fire Sector Summit 2012,"* * *

_Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version._

I would like to say how delighted I am to be invited to speak to this Summit - an event that grows in importance every year.

I am particularly pleased that the Summit brings together all parts of the fire industry - not only those who deliver the fire and rescue service at the sharp end, but all those who, often behind the scenes, do so much to ensure the buildings we live in and the products we use on a daily basis, are safe.

### A success story

And in terms of fires you should all congratulate yourselves on a considerable success story. In England, fire fatalities and non-fatal casualties fell by 34 per cent and 54 per cent respectively between 2001-02 and 2011-12, and the average area of fire damage fell by 20 per cent in dwellings and around 10 per cent in other buildings during the same period. Last year, total fires fell by 6 per cent to 227,000. I very much hope that these trends continue way into the future.

As part of Government's commitment to maintaining a high profile focus on prevention activity, the Fire Kills campaign is currently running its hugely successful national advertising campaign. As with last year, we are encouraging everyone to test their smoke alarms when they change their clocks this weekend as you are four times more likely to die in a fire if you do not have a working smoke alarm. I would ask that in order to extend the reach and breadth of the campaign, you use your own websites to disseminate this important message. By working together we have the opportunity to really drive home the importance of fire safe behaviour and maintain the downward trend on fire deaths.

The interaction between the fire industry and fire and rescue is a complex one - and for that reason I am delighted that the Fire Sector Federation is playing an increasingly important role in pulling all parts of the fire industry together, into a forum where ideas and knowledge can be exchanged. And I would particularly like to thank Brian Robinson, the Chairman of the Federation, for his hard work and perseverance in bringing the Federation to life.

### The importance of co-operation

Growth is a top priority for this Government. Supporting business growth for both new and existing companies is fundamental to our approach. And encouraging the creation of new businesses and sectors is crucial to this country's future. These new businesses will help to create the necessary wealth and growth, and much needed jobs. But we need also to ensure that both new and existing businesses are strong and resilient, including safeguarding and protecting them from the devastating effects of a fire.

All of you here today will know, a fire can result in a business loss both in terms of its employees, its contribution to the local economy, and ability to recover and trade again in the aftermath of an incident.

I urge the fire sector to go out and proactively engage with representative bodies for industry and commerce and make the case for effective and proportionate fire protection - passive and active interventions - in all areas of business in England.

### False alarms

The industry also has a vitally important role to play in ensuring that we make the best use of innovative technology. You will know better than me, the scope for technology to improve resilience to fire - but one area where more can be done is in limiting the number of false alarms. Last year there were 249,000 fire false alarms.

London Fire Brigade says that despite a reduction of 23 per cent in false alarms in the last five years, a fire engine is still called to a false alarm every 12 minutes in the capital, costing an estimated £34 million every year. More importantly, these unnecessary calls impact on the Brigade's ability to attend real incidents, deliver training and carry out vital community safety work.

I believe that technology can address this issue. To that end I have asked Brian Robinson to see what the industry itself can do to drive down false alarms through improved technology. Brian has asked a Fire Sector Federation working group under Martin Harvey to look into this issue - and I very much look forward to hearing their findings.

### Workforce development

Another area where I see significant improvement is in relation to workforce development in fire and rescue services. Here collaborative working between the Sector Skills Council - Skills for Fire and Rescue, and the Chief Fire Officers Association amongst others, is starting to produce tangible results, especially in the risk critical areas of intervention activity. Such work helps underpin Integrated Risk Management Plans, interoperability, national resilience and common working. Much energy is being devoted to this work. I would like to thank Max Hood, the chair of the National Occupational Committee for his efforts in leading this work.

### Public procurement

I know that many of you have an interest in public procurement and accessing new markets. This is an area where Government is keen to help. As you may know, the Government has put in place the Contracts Finder website, aimed at making it easier for suppliers to find and apply for public sector contracts. It is the main source of government opportunities worth more than £10,000.

My Department has already approached certain fire and rescue authorities to help populate pipelines and is very grateful for the assistance given to date. We are now asking all fire and rescue authorities for help to get as much information on future procurements in the pipeline - this should not be difficult as fire and rescue authorities should already be publishing this information existing contracts and tenders under the Local Government Transparency Code. The information on future procurements will help strengthen the UK Supply Chain by identifying current gaps between supply and demand and giving industry the confidence to invest for the future.

The Government is also committed to devolving power away from Whitehall so that fire and rescue authorities can decide how they can deliver services in a way that best meets their communities' needs. I hope that the fire sector can join together to develop new ways of working and further innovation that can stimulate growth for all.

### Youth employment

I want to speak a little about youth employment. In response to the challenge of youth unemployment, year the Deputy Prime Minister has launched a £1billion Youth Contract to help unemployed people get a job. The Youth Contract will provide a number of new opportunities for young people, including apprenticeships and work experience placements. Many of you will be aware of the The Prince's Trust Fire Industry Scheme, and some have supported it. I wish to thank you for that, and encourage others to get involved if they can.

I know a number of fire and rescue authorities have started training apprentices. I was particularly impressed to hear that in Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service 12 young people have started a community safety apprenticeship.

The apprentices are young people who have already had some contact with Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service, for example through the Prince's Trust courses, cadets and Fire Fly following a targeted recruitment campaign.

To support them through the application process, they put on a 10-day pre-recruitment course - run by Salford City College - to give candidates an understanding of working with people in the communities they would serve, as well as meeting a Community Safety Adviser who is already in the job, so they know exactly what the role entails.

I would like to commend Greater Manchester for this valuable initiative, and wish the new entrants every possible success in their apprenticeship, and future careers.

### Retained duty system firefighters

And finally, the one area where industry and the fire and rescue service co-operate on a daily, if not hourly basis, is in the retained duty system. There is no doubt that the retained duty system is the backbone of the fire and rescue response in large swathes of the United Kingdom. We must as leaders in the fire sector, where ever possible, bring to people's attention the valuable work done by retained duty firefighters, and encourage employers and members of the public to offer their services to this essential service.

Thank you.

_Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version._

### Introduction

I am delighted to be here today in my second full week in my new job. I'd like congratulate Vij (Randeniya) on his election as the new CFOA President and thank Lee (Howell) for all his work as part of the presidential team.

I would like to put on record my thanks to fire and rescue authorities for the important role they played in torch relays across the United Kingdom and during the Olympic and Paralympics Games.

Although the role that fire and rescue authorities played has gone almost unnoticed in the public eye, the effort and resources which were put in place were greatly appreciated across Government. I am pleased that a number of fire and rescue authority staff who made a significant contribution in delivery of services will be receiving recognition in the form of a commemorative medallion.

I'd also like to play tribute to Bob Neill, who I know had a deep understanding of the issues you face, a huge knowledge of the sector, and who worked closely with you on resetting the relationship between central and local government, devolving power and responsibility to the front line professionals, to communities and their local elected representatives - where it rightly sits.

I am very pleased to have been given this brief and I look forward to working with you and your elected members in the coming weeks, months and, hopefully, years. I'm particularly pleased to say that my new brief maintains the link between fire and rescue and local government. Alongside my fire responsibilities I am also local government Minister. This is particularly important to me as I am a keen proponent of local determination on service delivery, on prioritisation and on spending decisions. Keeping the fire and local government link is vital in this and I am sure you will be pleased to hear that I intend to continue Bob's good work here, embedding localism, continuing the integration of funding via the business rates system, and more importantly, getting out of the way to let you do what you do best.

### Fire Prevention

We will of course, continue to support you where it is appropriate. Thankfully, the number of fires and associated fatalities and injuries continue to fall. The latest statistics show fire deaths in the home have more than halved in the last twenty years - and fell 12 per cent last year.

This is a fantastic achievement and the Fire Kills campaign is a great example of how effective a partnership between Government and local fire and rescue authorities can be. The campaign's annual report for 2011/12 was published last week. It clearly demonstrates the range and impact of fire prevention activity being delivered by both the Department through its media campaign, and by its partners. The outstanding success of this campaign is, as you know, in large part due to the sterling, and often innovative, work undertaken at the local level to embed its fire safety messages with both the general public, and with those who may be especially vulnerable to the risks from fire.

Ultimately, the commitment of you and your local partners to the prevention agenda saves lives and resources. It ensures that our communities are safer places, less exposed to the destruction and devastation caused by fire.

The challenge must now be to maintain that clear focus on fire prevention, community safety and resilience. Working together allows us to deliver consistent safety messages, tailoring and targeting the campaign to maximise its effectiveness at the local level.

Next month, the Fire Kills campaign will again be running the hugely successful national advertising campaign to encourage everyone to test that their smoke alarms are working when changing their clocks. I'm sure you'll already be considering how best to support this at the local level.

By working together we have the opportunity to really drive home the importance of fire safe behaviour and maintain the downward trend on fire deaths. Given its impact, I am committed to maintaining a high profile focus on community fire prevention and safety activity.

### Resilience

Prevention activity doesn't just relate to improving fire safety. We have a model for civil contingency delivery that fits with our views of localism: planning and action at local level based on local risks and with partners having local accountability to make your localities more resilient places.

I know fire and rescue authorities are increasingly providing strategic leadership to local multi-agency emergency planning activity, with Chief Fire Officers chairing four of England's 38 local resilience forums.

This means fire and rescue authorities working with partners locally to better identify and mitigate complex resilience risks that could disrupt everyday life; including flooding, severe winter weather, disruption to fuel supplies or security threats. I hope, as I'm sure you do, that your role in responding to these types of emergencies is not called upon. But in my role as Minister for fire, resilience and emergencies I am keen to hear more about the good examples of the role of fire and rescue authorities in local multi-agency planning that strengthens our ability to quickly respond and recover from disruptive events.

### A clear vision for local delivery - The National Framework

At the very heart of the Government's ambition is putting power back where it belongs - in communities and with the locally elected councilors who represent them.

Fire and rescue authorities have been empowered with greater freedoms and flexibilities. You now have general powers of competence and an equivalent general power along with the ability to consult locally to allow charging for additional activities including the option for charging for persistent false reports. These are good examples of central Government stepping back and letting you get on with your job.

The Fire and Rescue National Framework is currently proceeding through parliament, and will be fully in force in October this year. I've come to it new. But I like what I see. For me, it embodies the right approach; setting high level principles instead of detailed requirements - it's 'what' not 'how'. I am pleased to hear that CFOA has welcomed this document. I would also like to thank you for the support and advice I understand you gave to officials as part of the working group. I think we should all be proud of the Framework, one that moves away from prescription to empowerment, and one that clearly sets out three bold priorities for fire and rescue authorities to:

  * identify and assess the full range of foreseeable fire and rescue related risks their areas face, make provision for prevention and protection activities and respond to incidents appropriately
  * work in partnership with their communities and a wide range of partners locally and nationally to deliver their service; and
  * be accountable to communities for the service they provide.

It goes without saying that this includes the business community. I firmly believe that businesses have the right to expect that those enforcing regulatory compliance do so in accordance with the fundamental principles of better regulation. I know that CFOA are keen to address shortcomings in this area and to lead work at the local level to develop fire safety audit and enforcement responsibilities to reflect more closely the aspirations that businesses have. Essentially, this means for helpful, proportionate and consistent advice on compliance.

Given that economic growth and business support is our number one priority, I commend you for your approach and look forward to a positive progression of this significant tranche of work.

Our national resilience to major fire and rescue related risks remains a priority for government. But we can only do this together, through true partnership, working across all local and national responders.

That is why we have put in place the Fire and Rescue Strategic Resilience Board, and it is already bringing key partners together to consider national resilience issues. Of course, government will continue to set the strategic direction, but our approach to national resilience must be based on and drawn from local capability alongside your professional expertise.

We can only prepare effectively if we have an approach to resilience based on local expertise and knowledge. Communities rightly expect their local fire and rescue authorities to play their part in keeping the country safe; every major emergency originates as a local emergency and being able to plan effectively for all incidents and emergencies, irrespective of whether they are of a local, cross-border or national nature, is essential.   
In delivering for your communities, you need to engage them - give them a real understanding of the risks being faced and the full range of what you are doing so they can better understand why you make the decisions you do.

We all know there are some increasingly tough decisions to be made on how best to allocate prevention, protection and operational resources locally - this needs to be done in a way that meets community aspirations in an open and consultative way.

By giving communities a voice, you give them a choice:

  * choice to make their views known on whether their priorities are the same as yours
  * choice to come up with new ideas on service provision; and
  * choice to challenge you on these issues.

Going further, we are today launching a  consultation on assurance statements, a mechanism for showing the public how the services they provide are run by their authorities. I know that some of you have mixed feelings on such statements. But for me this is about demonstrating a commitment to greater openness, showing the taxpayer how their money (including council tax) is spent, enabling communities to hold their authorities to account over how they spend the public's money and for the decisions that they make. And some of you are already doing it very well. Every aspect of council business - including the decisions they make for the delivery of fire and rescue - should be open to public scrutiny including senior pay, councillor expenses and local services.

### Economic context

I am of course mindful of the financial backdrop we all face. We have taken tough decisions necessary to reduce the budget deficit that we inherited from the last administration. Every bit of the public sector needs to do its bit to help, and local government accounts for a quarter of the public sector.

I value the incredibly important service that fire and rescue authorities deliver for local communities, and the part they play in national resilience. Despite the need to cut the national deficit, fire and rescue, as a frontline emergency service, has been given funding protection with reductions back-loaded to give more time for sensible savings to be made and reductions applied to fire and rescue authorities have been less than those applied to local authorities in general.

You will know that we are currently consulting upon plans for 2013-15 funding as part of the business rates retention scheme - this consultation is due to close on the 24th of September and I know that many of you have already engaged in the process. I would urge those whose voices have not yet been heard to ensure they make their views known.

I know that you are anxious to see what funding might look like from 2013, but I'm sure you will appreciate that I cannot pre-empt the consultation, nor can I pre-empt the announcements on funding for 2013/14, which I expect to be made in December in the usual way.

Despite the challenges, or maybe because of them, I know that you as the professional leaders for the fire and rescue sector are making great strides in efficiency. You have well established processes in place to use integrated risk management plans to make strategic and operational decisions on the siting of fire stations, the staffing and equipping of such stations, and hours of operation of each station. You are looking at your own service configuration to delivering services in a new environment. Some of you are looking at how you use your estate, I know for example that Merseyside are working with the police to share headquarters, that partners in the North West and partners in the South are sharing control rooms.   
Just last week I visited my local constituency fire and rescue authority, Norfolk, who updated me on their Combined fire and rescue, police and ambulance station in Sheringham which officially opened in January this year.

Sharing buildings is also bringing collaboration on other matters, and I am sure that all of you are looking outside your own sector to see how the country's national emergency services estate could be better used - sharing facilities and back office services. I know that you are increasingly working with the Ambulance Service and that inter-agency collaborations and interoperability are becoming increasingly important. I'm sure there are ways that we can work and share with the Ambulance Service and other partners and not only improve the services we deliver but also become more efficient.

### Engagement

Well, in two weeks, you can imagine that I am only just scratching the surface of what your issues are. I have already met with Cllr Kay Hammond, who as you know is the new Chair of the Fire Services Management Committee. I outlined to Cllr Hammond that I want to strengthen my engagement with your elected politicians, and I have made clear that as well as having a more regular engagement with the FSMC, I will want to meet chairs and members of fire and rescue authorities. I know that as the professional leadership of the sector you will want to support your councilors in meetings with me.

I also want to broaden my engagement with CFOA as the representative body for senior professionals. I will be meeting with your president, vice-president and vice-president elect. After this I want my engagement to be with the Board and the Council - I want to hear a broad range of views, and I will make time to engage with you on a regular basis and intend to get out and about visiting as many of your areas as possible.

### CFRA

The National Framework specifically embeds the key role of the post of the Chief Fire and Rescue Adviser who provides professional, independent advice both to senior officials and Ministers. The post was first created in 2007 with Sir Ken Knight filling the position since that time. However, earlier this year Ken indicated that, having completed five years, and with the Olympics behind us it was the right time to move on.

Having served in Fire and Rescue for over 40 years, including positions as Chief Fire Officer of County, Combined and Metropolitan Fire Authorities as well as the Fire Commissioner for London, Ken has provided consistent and professional advice to my predecessors as he continues to give me. I have hugely valued his input in my first weeks.

The Secretary of State and I recognise the value and importance of professional advice within the Department and therefore we will shortly be advertising for Ken's successor whilst I am delighted that Ken has agreed to remain in post until the appointment is made. I hope that senior professionals will take an interest in the post, seeing it as an opportunity to utilise their knowledge and experience to support officials and Ministers.

We will also be continue to provide opportunities for secondments from the sector to contribute professional views to the development of government policy and give individuals a chance to develop and to experience the workings of government. I hope you will see DCLG as a good place to send your brightest officers as a key part of their career progression.

There will be other opportunities to say thank you to Ken but I wanted to place on record the Government's appreciation for the support and advice he has given through the last challenging five years, and of course the previous 41 years in fire and rescue.

### Conclusion

I hope that I have given you a clear indication of where my priorities lie. I recognise that there are tough times ahead but I believe fire and rescue authorities and Chief Fire Officers can provide the leadership needed to continue to deliver a trusted and excellent public service. A new and more collaborative national-local relationship provides an opportunity for fire and rescue authorities, and organisations like CFOA, to play an ever stronger part in setting the agenda and in keeping our communities and our nation safe. I look forward to working with you all. Fire and rescue services are hugely respected in the UK and have the ability to reach high.

Thank you.

_Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version._

Those who know me will know I love India, a country I have visited many times. A country that inspires in me the same sort of awe that impelled a spellbound Mark Twain to write of:

> ""...that cradle of the human race, birthplace of human speech, mother of history, grandmother of legend, great-grandmother of traditions…
> 
> ""...the one land that all men desire to see, and having seen once, by even a glimpse, would not give that glimpse for the shows of all the rest of the world combined.""

But it is not merely India's great ancient spirit that captivates me. A spirit that has shaped the religious, literary and intellectual lives. Of billions of people, generation after generation. What beguiles me about India is its extraordinary vitality, its youthful exuberance. Unshackled by the past. Unwilling to build its future on the shifting sands of yesterday. It has eyes only for the future.

Indira Ghandi once said:

> ""There are two kinds of people. Those who do the work and those who take the credit.""

India has only ever been interested in being the former category. Only ever interested in listening to the drumbeat of ideas. The drumbeat of education. The drumbeat of innovation.

And everywhere you look in modern India today you will see new totems of progress. The airports in Bangalore and in Hyderabad. The Bandra-Worli Sea link in Mumbai. The metro in Delhi.

In Britain we are firmly set on the self-same sea of progress. Not far from here in East London the world is gripped by another sporting extravaganza. Wheelchairs revving. Blades buzzing. Paralympians like India's Girisha [Hosanagara Nagarajegowda], reaching Olympian heights and grabbing medals.

Yet a few years back there were no new sporting wonders of the world. No pristine park to entertain sporting royalty. Just 300 acres of deserted wasteland. It took British skill, British expertise, British ambition, to turn Stratford into a place fit to host the Olympian spirit.

And we're pressing on. Pushing progress as far as it will go. From the Thames estuary to the Atlantic gateway. Our Local Enterprise Partnerships now span England, creating new zones of economic influence, offering ever more internationally competitive technological readiness and business sophistication. Freezing business rates and relaxing planning rules to attract the investor's wandering eye.

So Britain and India are fellow travellers. Sharing the same desire to progress. The same entrepreneurial drive. The same ambition. And that's why we want to see our relationship blossom. Currently our trade relationship is worth £16.8billion a year. Fine for a partnership of economic convenience, but not for those of us who desire a marriage of ambition.

And were the genie to offer me two wishes, I would wish firstly to see more Indian businesses, more companies like Tata, coming over here to take advantage of one of the best business climates in the world. Making the most of the brands, the creativity and technology that only Britain has to offer

And secondly I would wish to see more Indian companies turning to British expertise to help feed that economic tiger. Turning Indian plans for $1trillion of investment in infrastructure into concrete reality.

Already our relationship is maturing. Exports to India were up 40 per cent last year, while UK companies announced £9billion of investment in India.

But forget those figures for a moment. For evidence of what our two great nations can achieve together you need only shift your gaze across the London skyline to the Olympic Park. Where a brave new steel sculpture soars above our grand new sporting amphitheatres. Those modern day wonders of the world.

At 377 feet, the ArcelorMittal Orbit is Britain's tallest sculpture. But it is also much more - designed by Anish Kapoor, funded by Lakshmi Mittal - it is a structure celebrating Anglo-Indian ingenuity. A symbol proudly proclaiming Britain and India's determination to reach for the stars. And a sign, above all, of marvellous things to come for our two great countries.

### Introduction

> ""India has an unparalleled desire, an unquenchable enthusiasm, an unshakeable belief in the future.""

It's a privilege to be here tonight and to follow such distinguished guest speakers.

Anyone who knows me will know I love India, from India's democracy - the largest in the history of the world - a pillar of stability in an unsettled region, to the music of Ravi Shankar that fills my iPod. Not to mention, of course, India's great cricketing heritage.

And standing here at the home of cricket magical memories of golden summers come flooding back: Kapil Dev striking four consecutive sixes to save the follow on; Rahul Dravid lifting his bat to celebrate a century, engraving his name on the honours board for all time. Like many neutrals I was sad to see India exit the TwentyTwenty World Cup at an early stage. As a long suffering England fan I certainly knew how Indian fans must be feeling.

### India's ambition

Yet there is something else about India that I admire. Something contained in its literature, its mathematics, its music, its films and its sport. Something that its great companies like George's Muthoot Group and golden peacock winners past and present display in abundance. And that is ambition.

India has an unparalleled desire, an unquenchable enthusiasm, an unshakeable belief in the future. It epitomises Gandhi's words to:

> ""Be the change you want to see in the world.""

I first came across that ambition as a youngster growing up in Bradford. I saw how the Indian community was a vibrant, galvanising, positive force that transformed local life.

> ""Britain is the place to be... a place where sustainable companies can strut their stuff.""

Today I see that ambition again in the way the wildfire of economic liberalisation has ignited the Indian economy, spreading growth from city to city, from the fantastic new airports in Bangalore and Hyderabad, to the Bandra-Worli Sea Link in Mumbai and to the metro to Delhi. And it is the tremendous driving force of India's ambition that has set it firmly on the path towards becoming an economic superpower.

### Britain is the land of opportunity

Now there's an old Hindi saying that I believe translates as:

> ""Gone abroad and come home a peacock.""

And for those with ambition Britain is the place to be. This is the land of opportunity - a place where sustainable companies can strut their stuff. We didn't just host an Olympic Games last month, we didn't just create an Olympic stadium - more sustainable than any of its predecessors, we didn't just run the most successful Paralympics ever - at which our very own golden Peacock (Jonnie Peacock) smashed the world 100 metres record. We founded an Olympic legacy.

You will find it ten miles to the east in the blossoming Olympic Park in Stratford. A once desolate wasteland  that now houses new sporting wonders of the world, that stand alongside Westfield - Europe's largest new shopping centre and next to a new tech city.

### Growth across the country

This picture of growth is being replicated right the way across the country, from the Thames Gateway to the Atlantic Gateway, from the Marches to Manchester, from the Solent to Sheffield.

We've taken a leaf out of India's Panchayati Raj system and recognised that we're better off when we take power out of the hands of senior elected representatives and let local communities take charge.

So we've now got Local Enterprise Partnerships - coalitions of local business and local authorities - forming natural economic alliances.

And creating Enterprise Zones - with relaxed planning rules, superfast broadband and generous business rates to fire up their local economies and attract eager inward investors.

Meanwhile, we've let our great cities like Birmingham Liverpool and Nottingham off the leash to renew their industrial might of old and conquer new frontiers in bioscience and advanced manufacturing.

### Building on a great relationship

Now we're proud of our relationship with India, proud that companies of the calibre of our winners today can come here. Proud that Tata's investment in steel production and car manufacture is safeguarding jobs from Teesside to Wolverhampton. Proud that 180 Indian firms invest in our IT sector. Together it's a relationship that brings in £16.8billion a year.

And as someone who loves India, you can only imagine my pleasure at becoming a member of a Government committed to strengthening an already powerful bond.

After all, when times are tough in the Eurozone and the world in general, supporting open markets and free enterprise becomes more important, not less. And supporting the trade, commerce and investment between our two countries is more essential, more valuable, than ever before. So that's why we are expanding our frontline diplomatic staff.

That's why the Prime Minister and Chancellor made a point of visiting within months of taking office, accompanied by many British CEOs. And it is why today you will find British businesses across the land eyeing up the opportunities India is offering. They know that India is looking to invest $1trillion in infrastructure in the years ahead. And having tested their mettle on the biggest infrastructure project in Europe, having worked on projects like Crossrail, they are champing at the bit to help a country whose destiny will be to remould our future.

### Conclusion

Now over in the Olympic Park you will find a great totem to Anglo-Indian ambition, the towering ArcelorMittal Orbit, 115 metres of steel proudly proclaiming that, when it comes to our friendship, the sky is the limit.

And it is my hope to visit India early in the new year, to do absolutely everything I can to realise the enormous promise of our relationship. To help British and Indian companies ruffle some feathers, grasp the burgeoning opportunities out there, and in the coming years bring a pride of golden peacocks home to roost.

In four days time we'll be handing the Olympic flame onto Brazil. But when it leaves, the flame of opportunity, the flame of capability and the flame of progress will remain in the UK. And will continue to burn brightly in this magnificent city of London.

![iframe: ](https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XUawrRfqw_I?start=74;rel=0;showinfo=0)

Over in the Olympic Park are seven new arenas. Seven venues that are cause for wonder - cause for celebration. Not just because they were completed on time and under budget. But because they will enjoy a new lease of life once the Games is over. Either as a sporting venue here or - taken down and reassembled - in another corner of the globe.

And there is an eighth wonder too - the Olympic Park itself. A once barren wasteland brought to full bloom. A place thousands will soon call home. Close by Europe's largest shopping centre. Near the site of a new tech city that will rival Silicon Valley. Crisscrossed by new bridges bringing communities together, and intersected by railway lines linking major business districts to more local people.

Now the spark that lit up the Olympic park has ignited a wildfire of creativity. Spreading eastwards. Illuminating the Thames Gateway. From the new development at South End Airport to the high speed manufacturing plant in Dagenham. From the Enterprise Zone in the fertile heart of the Royal Docks to the revitalised towns of Strand East, Canning Town and Woolwich Central.

It's a transformation that calls to mind a verse from John Dryden, the greatest poet of his day, who more than 300 years ago watched a different London rise like a Phoenix from the embers of a Great Fire that had laid waste to his precious city. And inspired wrote:

> ""Already from this chymic flame
> 
> ""I see a city of more precious mould,
> 
> ""Rich as the town which gives the Indies name,
> 
> ""With silver paved and all divine with gold.""

So there is massive opportunity here to grasp the torch of investment, and to, in the words of John (Armitt not Dryden):

> ""Stretch the moment.""

And, for would be backers, Britain is an investors dream:

  * the easiest place to do business anywhere in Europe;
  * the lowest business tax rates available anywhere in any advanced country;
  * home to the world's best universities;
  * birthplace of the language of business - English.

And it's not like the old days when London was the only town in the game. Growth is spreading its wings right across the country.

We've Local Enterprise Partnerships - local business and local authorities - competing to be the best areas for inward investment.

And we've Enterprise Zones - relaxing planning rules, offering reduced business rates to encourage new investment.

Above all we've got brilliant British construction companies you can partner with. And, if the Olympic Park is a monument to anything it is a monument to their fantastic endeavour.

More than 1600 firms from up and down the land, the cream of our national construction, engineering, architectural and design talent, built 98 per cent of the Park.

They brought us the technical wonder of the Olympic Stadium, with a third of the steel of Beijing's 'Bird's Nest'.

They produced an Olympic Village with the largest grouping of sustainable quality homes anywhere in the country.

They created the remarkable Energy Centre at the Olympic park - a renovated Edwardian sweet factory - whose innovative biomass boilers not only heat every single venue and build in the park at a radically reduced cost to the environment, but will, long after the Games, power new buildings and new communities.

And this well-spring of construction talent is unlikely to run dry any time soon, because to get the Park and village built we trained an army. Of the 46,000 people to have worked on the Olympic Park and Olympic Village, 10 per cent were previously unemployed. We gave them the skills they needed to complete Europe's largest construction project.  
   
And soon the Olympic Park will play host to new universities and new technical institutions so that our British production line will be fed by an inexhaustible tributary of talent far into the future.

Now we're mightily proud of every single one of the construction companies who poured their talent and their time into making these such a fantastic Games. They are true Olympic heroes. And once the Games are over we'll be looking for every opportunity for them to blow their own trumpets.

So these are great days to get in on the British shop floor. Days when we might say as Dryden once said:

> ""The venturous merchant who designed more far,
> 
> ""And touches on our hospitable shore,
> 
> ""Charmed with the splendour of this northern star
> 
> ""Shall here unlade him and depart no more.""

And our would-be investors have still to feast on the possibilities of what's to come

  * Crossrail - Uniting the commercial might of West London with the growing power in the East of the city; and
  * High Speed 2 - The most ambitious national rail project this country has ever seen. Bringing the rest of the country closer than ever to the capital, and to our European and international gateways.

But this isn't just about what you can do for us. It's about what we can do for you. As the Chief Executive* of one large construction company remarked not so long ago:

> ""The Olympics is a fantastic global shop window for British management expertise, design and construction skills, and that expertise can be exported to make other games equally impressive.""

He's spot on.

The one-time owner of our splendid venue today, The Duke of Sutherland, was known as the 'Leviathan of wealth'. And today in our British construction industry there is a new Leviathan; of know-how, of talent, of confidence. Undaunted by the most enormous of tasks, in the shape of its life, charged up and ready to deliver. Any place, any time, anywhere.

So we're looking ahead to see how we can pass the flame of our experience onto Sochi, host city of the next Winter Olympic Games. Onto Brazil, and beyond that onto Korea and Qatar.

And four days from now, when the curtain comes down on the greatest Games ever hosted, we won't feel sad. We will feel excited for there are great days ahead for Great Britain.

_Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version._

Well, it's great to be here to today. Talking about pubs and beer. And I'm in exalted company.

![Pub sign](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2149202.jpg)George & Dragon pub

British historian A.J.P. Taylor thought; 

> ""most of the great men of the past were only there for the beer.""

He appears to have been right.

William Shakespeare said:

> ""A quart of ale is a dish for a king.""

Dr Johnson believed:

> ""There is nothing which has been yet contrived by man, by which so much happiness is produced as by a good tavern or inn.""

And when, in the July election of 1945, Times editor suggested to Winston Churchill that he retire gracefully soon after the campaign… the great man replied;

> ""Mr. Editor, I leave when the pub closes.""

All these patrons knew what we know. That what we drink and where we drink tells us who we are. And nothing says Britain more than our Great British pub and our Great British beer.

They are part of a tradition dating back to ancient times. Beer was drunk in the taverns of Roman England. In the Anglo-Saxon alehouse. In the inns of the Middle Age.

> ""The 'local' is the beating heart of our communities""

Before I came here today I did a bit of a pub crawl - online of course. It turns out that within a one mile radius of this building there are more than 400 pubs. And their names might as well be chapters from a history of Britain.

  * Boadicea
  * Shakespeare
  * George and the Dragon
  * Silver Cross
  * Battle of Trafalgar

And it's curious how history reflected in a pint glass, is history brought sharply into focus.

We can almost see Samuel Pepys witnessing the Great Fire of London in 1666 from ""a little alehouse on Bankside"".

Doctor Johnson penning his famous Dictionary at The Anchor in Southwark.

Dirty Den handing Anj the divorce papers on a Christmas night in the Queen Vic.

And Bet Lynch leaving the Rovers Return for the last time.

But while pubs are tied to our past they are equally an essential part of our present.

We call it the 'local' because it is the beating heart of our communities.

The place we gather.

> to socialise  
to celebrate  
to commiserate  
to champion and to cherish our way of life

But I'm not going to get all misty eyed today.

> ""Pubs and beer mean business.""

Pub and beer mean business. And a heady mix of the worlds best beer and the world's best brewers…

> …a potent cocktail of our famous beer companies  
…our industrious family brewers  
…our innovative microbreweries…  
...have made this industry a colossus.

The facts speak for themselves.

Individually, according to the British Beer and Pub Association, each pub contributes an estimated £80,000 to its local economy. Collectively, they contribute over £19 billion to the national economy. And in total they're sustaining nearly 900,000 jobs.

That's why for all their historical and cultural significance, our pubs must be a vital part of our economic future.

Now it's been a tough few years for your industry. But we're not abandoning the local to its fate.

We've made sure small business rate relief - which we've doubled until the end of March next year - and rural rate relief are available to our public houses.

We're distilled rules on weights and measures for intoxicating liquor into simplified form.

And we're canning sales of alcohol below cost-price by supermarkets. Most pubs should experience the benefit of this minimum unit price.

And we're even making it far easier for you to play live music at your venues. Taking away the usual licensing rules from performances where the audience numbers 200 or fewer. We want people to make a song and a dance. But, in the pub, not over the paperwork.

These reforms will, I hope be the fillip the industry needs as we look forward to a summer of royal and sporting celebration. A triple whammy of festivity. The Diamond Jubilee, Olympics, the European Championship. Events that will have punters across the world beating a path to your door.

Now I want to make sure I do everything I can to make sure you're in the shape of your life in the coming months.

But this isn't just about me. It's about you too.

It's an open secret that, over the past few years, pub companies and licensees haven't always seen eye to eye.

A fact reflected in the Government's Select Committee report on pub companies last year.

Now we take your concerns about regulation very seriously. And we've listened. That's why we've got self-regulation not central regulation.

But make no mistake. This is about you grasping the nettle.

I can see there have been a lot of improvements;

  * a strengthened industry code
  * greater transparency
  * a new arbitration and mediation service

All good work. But don't expect me to pat you on the back just yet.

Now's the time to make good on your promise. Go further. Go faster. Do what you need to do to convince the doubters things have changed.

You need to put your house in order. Otherwise you might find the dead hand of Whitehall feeling your collar.

Now I started out by saying pubs are at the heart of local communities. I'd like to finish with a nod to our work on community pubs.

In the past few years we've seen local people coming forward to save their local.

The Rookhope Inn in Weardale was rescued by Sunderland-based charity St Aidan's Community Trust.

When the town of Hesket Newmarket faced losing their local, they didn't get bitter, they got bolder.

Now they are running it themselves.

My Cabinet colleague William Hague is one of almost 200 members to have rescued the only pub in the small North Yorkshire village of Hudswell.

![embed: ](https://www.youtube.com/v/rVYk7KCiFjw?version=3&hl=en_GB&rel=0)

  * [Hudswell community pub - transcript](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/newsroom/word/1867361.doc)

MS Word, 25 kb, 2 pages

In my constituency a couple of pals didn't save a pub. They built a brewery.

The founders of the Brentwood Brewing Company said:

> ""We tasted a pint, thought that's not brilliant - we can do better than this!""

But Community Right to Bid means help is on tap. It requires local authorities to keep a record of their valuable community assets.

When they come up for sale, the community can call for a six month time out.

Prepare a bid.

Organise a whip round.

And save their pub from extinction.

But let's be honest. Saving a pub is one thing. Running it is something else.

The community spirited pub owner can often find themselves dealing less with a going concern. Than a growing concern. Once the scales fall from their eyes they find themselves facing more bureaucratic barriers than an Olympic hurdler.

Over the past couple of years we've had what we've called, in Government circles, the Red Tape Challenge.

This is starting to make headway in hacking through a forest of regulation, for example, in regard to the hospitality industry. Some of which will clearly have a bearing on you.

But in the coming months we will also be casting our eye over the community pub sector to see if there are other areas where we can wield the red tape axe.

We need to make sure folk with a bit of get up and go don't have all their enthusiasm watered down by a ministry of meddlers.

So we're taking action to help the pub industry. Helping those who run community pubs.

Acting because pubs and brewing play a unique role in our lives. They are part of the warp and woof of our country.

And we're determined to make sure they remain at the heart of our nation long into our future.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/corporate/2189482,Abolition of Regional Strategies,"* * *

It is the Government's policy to revoke existing regional strategies outside London, reflecting manifesto commitments made by both Coalition parties in the 2010 general election and subsequently incorporated into the Coalition Agreement. The Localism Act 2011 provides for the abolition of regional strategies in a two-stage process. The first stage, to remove the regional planning framework and prevent further strategies from being created, took effect when the Localism Act received Royal Assent on 15 November. The second stage would be to abolish the existing regional strategies by secondary legislation. However, any final decision on this must take account of assessments of, and consultation on, the possible environmental effects of revocation of each of the existing regional strategies.

The Strategic Environmental Assessment process is set out in an EU Directive (Directive 2001/42/EC). In March 2012, the European Court of Justice issued a significant ruling on the interpretation and application of the Directive (Inter-Environnement Bruxelles ASBL & Others v Government of the Brussels-Capital Region).

As part of the Strategic Environmental Assessment process, and before the decision of the European Court of Justice, there has already been consultation with the statutory consultation bodies on the scope and level of detail of the environmental reports. Public consultation took place between October 2011 and January 2012 on the basis of environmental reports published in October 2011. Detailed responses were provided in the course of this exercise.  
   
Following the decision of the European Court of Justice, in the light of planning policy and legislation that have been put in place since January 2012, in light of the earlier consultation responses, and in order to be meticulous in observing the requirements of the Directive, the Government is now updating the environmental reports and undertaking additional consultation. We are publishing the first of the updated environmental reports: the report in respect of the proposed [revocation of the East of England Regional Strategy](http://www.communities.gov.uk/planningandbuilding/planningenvironment/strategicenvironmentassess/) shortly and will place a copy in the Libraries of both Houses. This report builds on and is intended to supersede the previous report.

The period for consultation responses will remain open for eight weeks. We welcome and encourage all interested parties to respond. At the end of that period we will consider all consultation responses, including those already submitted during the October 2011 to January 2012 response period.

In the coming weeks my Department will publish updated environmental reports relating to the proposals on each of the other regional strategies, so that those proposals too can be the subject of additional consultation. In each case there will be an 8 week period for consultation responses. All updated environmental reports will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses as they are published.

The proposed revocation of the Regional Strategies may be regarded as a material consideration by decision makers when determining planning applications and appeals.

In respect of plan-making, the National Planning Policy Framework implementation period provides councils with the incentive to get their plan policies up to date and in doing so they can have regard to the policy to revoke Regional Strategies and the new National Planning Policy Framework policies. A local plan document must be in general conformity with the regional strategy at the stage that the plan is submitted for examination but it is open to councils when preparing local plans to take account of the policy to revoke up to the time of submission. Local authorities can also bring forward proposals (for example on housing targets) which have a local interpretation to them in their plans, based on their own sound evidence base where that is justified by the local circumstances. That evidence base is likely to be more up to date than that included in the Regional Strategies. Each case will depend on its particular facts.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/corporate/firenationalframework,Fire and Rescue National Framework for England,"* * *

I have today published the Fire and Rescue National Framework for England. The Framework resets the relationship between fire and rescue authorities and Government. One of the key principles of which is to acknowledge the proficiency and experience of fire and rescue authorities; and to allow them the freedom and flexibility to deliver the services for which they are respected and renowned without Whitehall prescription.

The priorities in the Framework are for fire and rescue authorities to:

  * identify and assess the full range of foreseeable fire and rescue related risks their area faces, make provision for prevention and protection activities and to respond to incidents appropriately
  * work in partnership with their communities and a wide range of partners locally and nationally to deliver their service; and
  * be accountable to communities for the service they provide.

Fire and rescue authorities face new challenges: the need to deal with the continuing threat of terrorism, the impact of climate change, and the impacts of an ageing population, against a backdrop of change and the need to cut the national deficit. The Framework enables fire and rescue authorities to efficiently deliver their services; including working collaboratively with other fire and rescue authorities, or with other organisations, to improve public safety and cost effectiveness. Principally, it is to local communities, not central government, that fire and rescue authorities are accountable.

The Framework delivers on the Government commitment in its response to the Fire Future Reports, to clearly define national resilience and to set out clear roles and responsibilities in relation to national resilience. The Framework also sets out arrangements for fire and rescue authorities to collectively engage with Government on national resilience issues through a new Fire and Rescue Strategic Resilience Board. Through this Board, we will take a collaborative approach to national resilience that is based on and drawn from local capability, expertise, knowledge and leadership.

The Framework has an open-ended duration which gives fire and rescue authorities greater certainty. The high level, strategic nature of the Framework should mean that it will remain unchanged for the medium to long term.

Copies of the Fire and Rescue National Framework for England have been deposited in the Library of the House.

On 9 February I reported to the House on the Heads of Agreement on the firefighters' pension scheme to be introduced in 2015, which set out the Government's final position on the main elements of scheme design. My officials have continued discussions with the firefighter unions and the Local Government Association over the remaining details of the firefighters' pension scheme.  
  
The Government pays tribute to the importance of the work undertaken by our fire and rescue service and the bravery, dedication and professionalism of the men and women who work within it. The Government is committed to providing public service pensions that are sustainable, fair and effective.  
  
Building on the proposals brought forward by Lord Hutton, the proposed final agreement aims to strike a balanced deal between public service workers and the taxpayer. They will ensure that public service workers continue to have access to good pensions, while taxpayers benefit from greater control over their costs.  
  
Public sector pensions will remain among the very best available - a guaranteed level and inflation proofed. Only 1 in 10 private sector workers have access to such schemes.

I can now report to the House that discussions on the design parameters for the firefighters' pension scheme in England to be introduced in 2015 have been concluded. This sets out our final position on proposed scheme design, which we are asking unions to take to their Executives as the outcome of negotiations.  
  
The headline elements of the proposed final agreement are set out below. The Government intends to maintain constructive dialogue with the fire fighter unions and the Local Government Association as detailed work goes forward.  
  
There will be full statutory protections provided in the new Scheme for the accrued rights of existing Scheme members:

  * all benefits accrued under final salary arrangements will be linked to the members' final salary, in accordance with the rules of the members' current schemes, when they leave the reformed scheme
  * full recognition of a member's expectation to double accrual for service accrued under the Firefighters' Pension Scheme 1992 ('the 1992 scheme'), so that a member's full continuous pensionable service upon retirement will be used to calculate an averaged accrual rate to be applied to service accrued under the 1992 scheme
  * members to be able to access their 1992 scheme benefits when they retire at that scheme's 'ordinary pension' age (i.e. from age 50 with 25 or more years pensionable service), subject to abatement rules for that scheme. Pensionable service for the purpose of calculating the ordinary pension age will include any continuous pensionable service accrued under both the 1992 scheme and the 2015 scheme
  * members of the 1992 scheme will continue to have access to an actuarially assessed commutation factor for benefits accrued under that scheme

There also will be transitional statutory protections for qualifying, existing members:

  * all active scheme members who, as of 1 April 2012, have 10 years or less to their current Normal Pension Age will see no change in when they can retire, nor any decrease in the amount of pension they receive at their current Normal Pension Age. This protection will be achieved by the member remaining in their current scheme until they retire, which could be beyond 31 March 2022.
  * there will be a further 4 years of tapered protection for scheme members. Members who are up to 14 years from their current Normal Pension Age, as of 1 April 2012, will have limited protection so that on average for every month of age they are beyond 10 years of their Normal Pension Age, they gain about 53 days of protection. The last day of protected service for any member will be 31 March 2022.

The core parameters of the new Scheme are set out below:

> a. a pension scheme design based on career average revalued earnings
> 
> b. an accrual rate of 1/58.7th of pensionable earnings each year
> 
> c. there will be no cap on how much pension can be accrued
> 
> d. a revaluation rate of active members' benefits in line with average weekly earnings
> 
> e. pensions in payment and deferred benefits to increase in line with Prices Index (currently CPI)
> 
> f. Member contribution rates in the 2015 scheme from 1 April 2015 will average 13.2 per cent, equal to the expected average of contribution rates in the 1992 and 2006 schemes on the 31 March 2015. However, as announced by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury on 20 December 2011, the Government will review the impact of the proposed 2012-13 contribution changes, including the effect of membership opt-outs, before taking final decisions on how future increases will be delivered in 2013-14 and 2014-15, and in the new scheme. Interested parties will have a full opportunity to provide evidence and their views to the Government as part of the review
> 
> g. without prejudice to the outcome of that review, tariffs for the 2015 scheme are likely to provide for lower rates for new recruits, with some tiered progressive increases for middle, high, and higher income earners
> 
> h. flexible retirement from the scheme's minimum pension age of 55, built around the scheme's Normal Pension Age of 60, with members able to take their pension from the scheme's minimum pension age, as follows:
> 
> - for all active members who are aged 57 or more at retirement, 2015 scheme benefits taken before Normal Pension Age will be actuarially reduced with reference to the 2015 scheme's Normal Pension Age, rather than the deferred pension age  
- all other members will have their 2015 scheme benefits actuarially reduced on a cost neutral basis from the scheme's deferred pension age.
> 
> i. authority initiated early retirement for members of the 2015 scheme, from age 55, to be in accordance with the arrangements set out in Part 3, Rule 6 of the New Firefighters' Pension Scheme 2006
> 
> j. the Normal Pension Age will be subject to regular review. These reviews will consider the increasing State Pension Age and any changes to it, alongside evidence from interested parties, including unions and employers. It will consider if the Normal Pension Age of 60 remains relevant, taking account of the economical, efficient and effective management of the fire service, the changing profile of the workforce and the occupational demands of, and fitness standards for, firefighting roles
> 
> k. this regular review will be informed by research to be carried out, within the auspices of the Firefighters' Pension Committee, which will monitor and collate scheme data and experience
> 
> l. late retirement factors for members retiring from active service to be actuarially neutral from Normal Pension Age
> 
> m. a deferred pension age equal to the individuals' State Pension Age
>

> 
> o. abatement in existing schemes to continue
> 
> p. ill-health retirement benefits to be based on the arrangements in the 2006 scheme
> 
> q. all other ancillary benefits to be based on those contained in the 2006 scheme
> 
> r. members rejoining after a period of deferment of less than 5 years can link new service with previous service, as if they had always been an active member
> 
> s. members transferring between public service schemes would be treated as having continuous active service
>

http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/corporate/2236815,Localising council tax support,"* * *

In the 2010 Spending Review, the Government announced plans to localise council tax benefit and this is being taken forward through the Local Government Finance Bill currently before Parliament. From April 2013, these reforms will localise council tax support and give councils stronger incentives to support local firms, cut fraud, promote local enterprise and get people back into work.

These reforms contribute to the Government's deficit reduction programme, delivering savings of £470million a year of taxpayers' money in Great Britain from 2013-14. Welfare reform is vital to tackle the budget deficit, as council tax benefit expenditure in England increased from £2.0billion to £4.3billion from 1997-98 by 2010-11.

Localisation will give local authorities the flexibility to design council tax support schemes for working age claimants in their area. We have been clear that councils have the scope to help manage the impact of the reduction in council tax support funding through securing sensible savings. To help the transition to these changes, my Department has already provided £30million of funding to help councils draw up local support schemes.

There is a real incentive for councils to make savings in the new localised system from cutting fraud and error, where an estimated £200 million was paid out unnecessarily in 2011-12. However, we appreciate that these savings may not be delivered immediately in the first year.

Consequently, to further assist the transition process, my Department is today announcing an additional £100million of funding for councils to help support them in developing well-designed council tax support schemes and maintain positive incentives to work. This is new and additional funding for local government.

As councils draw up their local schemes, it is clear that many are delivering savings using their local flexibilities and discretion, without unfairly increasing the burden on those who are currently on benefits. Equally, there are some councils which are asking for very large additional contributions from those on benefits.

The new £100million transition grant will seek to encourage best practice. The voluntary grant will be available to councils (billing and major precepting authorities) who choose to design their local schemes so that:

  * those who would be on 100 per cent support under current council tax benefit arrangements pay between zero and no more than 8.5 per cent of their council tax liability;
  * the taper rate does not increase above 25 per cent;
  * there is no sharp reduction in support for those entering work - for claimants currently entitled to less than 100 per cent support, the taper will be applied to an amount at least equal to their maximum eligible award.

In allowing flexibility over aspects of the scheme, we would not expect local authorities to impose large additional increases in non-dependant deductions. Councils will rightly want to avoid collecting small payments, and it may consequently be better value for money for councils to avoid designing schemes which seek to do so.

The amount of funding for which councils will be eligible to apply and the timescales and process for making an application will be published shortly. We anticipate that councils will make applications after 31 January 2013, and that funding will be paid in March 2013. The grant will be a simple one, easy to apply for and swiftly paid out, to help those councils who choose to do the right thing.

The Government has a clear goal in tackling the deficit, and reducing spending on benefits. This measured, transitional approach will help deliver an important programme of welfare reform, whilst still protecting taxpayers' broader interests.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/corporate/august2011riots,August 2011 riots,"* * *

I am grateful to Darra Singh and the other members of the Riots, Communities and Victims Panel for their work on their independent review into last year's public disorder. They have presented us with a substantial report that seeks to identify steps that can be taken to strengthen social and economic resilience in the aftermath of last August's riots. We value the importance of the Panel's work and will publish further information on the Government response to the Panel's report in due course.

### Riots recovery

On 12 August 2011, as part of a concerted, cross-Government action, the Government announced a series of measures to help rebuild communities following the riots and public disorder in the summer of 2011.

The package provided immediate and ongoing support to open up shops and rebuild buildings which were damaged, make sure people who lost their homes were re-housed, and to help councils get their areas back to normal as quickly as possible.

Under these schemes, local councils played a pivotal role in providing support to local firms and local residents, with central Government reimbursing their costs. I would like to put on the record the thanks of Her Majesty's Government for the work of local government in giving clear and determined leadership to their communities.

The Department for Communities and Local Government reimbursed councils' immediate costs of around £10 million to make their areas safe, clear and clean again and to help councils reduce business rates, finance emergency building repairs and encourage customers back to affected areas. It also reimbursed councils for potential losses from New Homes Bonus payments as well as for immediate costs of just under £400,000 to re-house those made homeless by the public disorder.

We also recognise the leadership shown by the Mayor of London and local authorities across the country in driving recovery in their areas. Their leadership helped galvanise the community and brought people together to reclaim and rebuild their neighbourhoods. Salford celebrated local pride by launching an 'I love Salford' campaign as an act of defiance against the looters. Manchester made sure people understood what help was on offer by knocking on doors and helping to complete forms. The Mayor provided immediate advice to those affected through a dedicated website and helpline as well as supporting the charitable High Street Fund. The Mayor has also created a Regeneration Fund to create jobs and economic growth in the worst affected areas. 

Local authorities also provided their own funding or facilitated access to other funding. For example, the Croydon Enterprise Loan Fund provided interest free loans up to £10,000 to affected businesses and the Tottenham Fund in Haringey raised around £50,000 and received donations of clothes and goods for displaced families. Councils such as Ealing started making emergency payments to businesses within a week of the disorder working swiftly to overcome bureaucracy.

Government played its part, but communities themselves led the way and got on with the job of repairing the damage. We saw some remarkable examples of kindness - people coming together and giving their time and energy to cleaning up streets in the mornings after the disturbances, helping victims through donations of money and goods and affirming their pride in the places they live and work.

### Riots damages and insurance

Separate to these actions, residents could potentially also claim back costs from their insurers and/or police authorities.

The vast majority of individuals and businesses who suffered losses as a result of the riots last August have received a payout. Police authorities have concluded 95 per cent of all valid active uninsured claims made under the Riot (Damages) Act. Of those who have insurance approximately 95 per cent of individuals and 92 per cent of small to medium size businesses have received a payout from their insurer. There are also a number of claims to be settled by police authorities who are seeking reimbursement of costs they have paid to policy holders, so far 81 per cent of these cases have been dealt with. The majority of cases that are still outstanding in police authorities are being delayed as a result of required information that has not been sent by the claimants or insurance companies.

While every effort has been made to support and compensate victims, we are reviewing the Riot (Damages) Act to ensure that it is fit for a modern policing world.

### Policing reform

The scenes of disorder last year were unprecedented in modern times and we are working with the police to take forward recommendations of Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary's report, _The Rules of Engagement: A Review of the August 2011 disorders_. Significant progress has been made, including ongoing development of information and intelligence gathering; testing of swifter mobilisation capabilities; and, consideration and enhancement of the broad range of tactical responses required for policing disorder. Reform is an ongoing process and the work underway will help ensure the police maintain the sharpness to respond effectively each and every time.

The Panel's report also notes the need to improve engagement between the police and local communities. We know the public want a permanent and visible police presence in their communities, working alongside them to identify and tackle the issues that matter to them. The police should work openly and in partnership with all members of their community. From November, Police and Crime Commissioners will be responsible for ensuring that local people's voices are heard and acted upon and make sure that the police are delivering the priorities of the local community.

### Social policy review

Alongside responsible steps to strengthen our capabilities to deal with any future disturbances should they arise, Government is taking forward action to address some of the more entrenched issues highlighted in the Panel's report. We have conducted a review of social policy which has built upon existing programmes of work that were in place to address some of these issues, such as enhancing the support provided to parents. 

The importance of early intervention and good parenting was brought out strongly in the Panel's report. We know that the experiences children are exposed to in the very early years and before birth - social, economic, psychological and environmental - affect their health, wellbeing and outcomes in later life. The Government is increasing the number of health visitors by 4,200 and, for some of the most vulnerable families, doubling the number of places on the Family Nurse Partnership programme by 2015.

To support good parenting from the start, the Government is also retaining a network of Sure Start Children's Centres accessible to all families and focussing support on those who need it most. Evidence shows that universal stigma free services can play a crucial role in reaching the most vulnerable families as well as helping to improve outcomes for children. We are also trialling providing access to universal high quality parenting classes to mothers and fathers of young children.

We gave local councils much greater flexibility over how they use their funding, to enable them to work with local partners to prevent families reaching crisis points. In addition we have provided up to £11 million of funding over 2011-13 to the voluntary and community sector to deliver national online and telephone support services, including specialist support to help parents when they need it in dealing with a wide range of issues including relationship advice and dealing with children with behaviour problems.

Alongside expanding existing areas of work, the social policy review has led to the development of a further programme of action aimed at reducing crime and re-offending; supporting families and parents; welfare and work; supporting young people; and accelerating regeneration in our cities.

### Troubled Families initiative

The Troubled Families programme is targeting those families that would benefit most from help to turn their life around. Troubled families include those with adults out of work, children not in school and families who are committing anti-social behaviour and crime. Through tackling the root causes underlying a family's problems the programme will turn around the lives of 120,000 families by getting parents into work and children attending school. All 152 eligible councils have confirmed that they are ready and willing to run the programme in their area and are now well in to drawing up their lists of families so that help can get in there quickly. The programme is focusing on the most difficult families, but it will also help drive effective support to a wider number of families who are struggling but who are not the most disruptive or chaotic.

As well as addressing the family's needs, we are taking action to improve young people's life chances through a number of wide ranging reforms aimed at raising the educational attainment of disadvantaged pupils. These reforms include the Pupil Premium, the Academy and Free schools programme and strengthening teacher's powers to tackle bad behaviour in schools.

### Tackling gang and youth violence

We know that a significant proportion of young people involved in the disturbances had links with gangs. The cross-Government _Ending Gang and Youth Violence_ report, published in November 2011, contains a series of actions for central government and a set of principles and good practice examples to help local areas tackle the problem. Implementation of the report commitments is underway, including the provision of expert support to 29 areas most affected by gang and youth violence.

### Training and employment

We recognise that a successful passage to adulthood is best served by work. As the Panel's report highlights, we need to make sure that young people have the skills they need to get ready for work. That is why we are overhauling vocational education and have created the biggest apprenticeships programme our country has ever seen. We are determined to bring down the number of young people who are not in education, employment or training through making continuing in education and training to 18 compulsory and supporting those most in need via the Youth Contract which will provide additional support worth almost £1 billion, to young people over the next three years. As part of the Contract 160,000 wage incentives worth up to £2,275 each are now available to employers who recruit an 18-24 year-old from the Work Programme for at least 26 weeks. From late July 2012, in selected 'youth unemployment hotspots', wage incentives will be available via Jobcentre Plus to employ 18-24 year olds who have been claiming for 6 months.

### Effective justice

The Panel's report highlighted the number of rioters with a large number of previous criminal convictions. Last year, the Government published innovative plans to reform how we punish, sentence and rehabilitate offenders. We are already taking active steps to strengthen community sentences to stop less serious offenders getting to the stage where custody is necessary, with more intensive community payback, longer electronically monitored curfews and bans on driving and foreign travel. But we want to go further and have just consulted on proposals which include a clear punitive element in every community order handed down by the courts. In addition, since March 2012 all prison leavers that claim Jobseekers' Allowance will be mandated immediately onto the Work Programme. We are committed to improving the speed and efficiency of the criminal justice system, building on lessons learned from the swift response to the riots, and are setting out the work we are taking forward in the White Paper: _Swift and Sure Justice: the Government's Plans for Reform of the Criminal Justice System_, published today.

Alongside this we are taking forward policies to start tackling the high number of repeat offenders. We are making prison places of meaningful productive work and training where more prisoners are expected to work a full week and we are testing drug recovery wings which aim to get offenders off drugs for good. We are also implementing Payment by Results pilots, which will pay providers according to their success in reducing re-offending rates.

We are committed to legislating to extend landlords' powers to seek possession where a tenant or member of their household is convicted of an offence committed at the scene of a riot.

### Punishing criminals

The acts of selfless kindness shown by many, contrast starkly with those who robbed and looted, acting as a reminder that the riots were perpetrated by a reckless minority.

Government has sent a strong message to those that took part in the riots that acts of mindless criminality will not be tolerated. Those involved have been brought swiftly to justice. As of June 2012, 1,968 people were found guilty and sentenced. 1,292 people received immediate custody and their average sentence length was over four times longer than the average sentence for similar crimes in 2010 (based on those found guilty at the magistrates' court but sentenced at any court). Those sentenced to immediate custody were given an average custodial sentence length of 16.8 months. This compares to an average custodial sentence length of 3.7 months for those convicted at magistrates' courts, but sentenced at any court for similar offences in England and Wales in 2010.

Through these actions and the programme of work outlined in this response, we are confident that we are building strong foundations to address the issues raised in the Panel's report.

But there is one clear overriding message: the rioters were criminals. Such opportunistic criminality was not and will not be tolerated.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/corporate/2188953,Legacy FiReControl buildings,"* * *

I want to update the House on my Department's progress with the Regional Control Centre buildings - the main legacy asset of the terminated FiReControl project from the last Administration.

The nine Regional Control Centre buildings were procured through a private developer scheme from 2004 onwards and completed between June 2007 and February 2010. The leases run for 20 or 25 years from completion. As noted on 26 January 2009, _Official Report_, House of Commons, Column 108W, the last Administration decided not to include break clauses in the contracts, forcing taxpayers to shoulder the ultimate liability for the empty buildings.

The National Audit Office, in their report _The Failure of Fire Control_, were highly critical of the top-down FiReControl project. They stated:

> ""The FiReControl project was flawed from the outset because it did not have the support of those essential to its success - local fire and rescue services. The Department rushed the start of the project, failing to follow proper procedures. Ineffective checks and balances during initiation and early stages meant the Department committed itself to the project on the basis of broad-brush and inaccurate estimates of costs and benefits and an unrealistic delivery timetable, and agreed an inadequate contract with its IT supplier. The Department under-appreciated the project's complexity, and then mismanaged the IT contractor's performance and delivery. The Department failed to provide the necessary leadership to make the project successful, over-relying on poorly managed consultants and failing to sort out early problems with delivery by the contractor. The Department took a firmer grip of the project from 2009 and terminated the contract in December 2010 to avoid even more money being wasted""  
(National Audit Office, _The Failure of the FiReControl project_, HC1272, 1 July 2011).

Following the termination of the FiReControl project in December 2010 by the Coalition Government, my Department explored whether fire and rescue authorities could make use of the centres as they were purpose built for control services. Our next preference was for other emergency services to take over the buildings. Our prime aims were to ensure value for taxpayers' money and achieve a localist approach to improvements in resilience.

I can report success for four of the buildings. One is already in use as a control centre and three further buildings will be used by emergency services, as follows:

  * The London building was officially opened on 1 February 2012 - in good time for the Olympic and Paralympic Games - and is fully operational as the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority's control centre.
  * As announced by the Minister for Shipping on 22 November 2011, _Official Report_, House of Commons, Column 163, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency will use the Fareham building as their Operations Centre.
  * The Warrington building will be used as a shared control service for four fire authorities (Greater Manchester, Cheshire, Lancashire and Cumbria).
  * County Durham and Darlington Fire and Rescue Authority will use the Durham building as their new headquarters and control room.

Having sought public sector tenants, my Department is launching a marketing campaign to attract tenants from a wider range of organisations for the remaining five buildings, including from the private sector. These buildings are located in Wolverhampton, Cambridge, Taunton, Wakefield and Castle Donington. They are built to a high specification and have a number of desirable features, including excellent resilience, good security and easy access to major road networks. Buyers of the control rooms will also benefit from the £6,000 a piece deluxe, polished chrome 'Brasilia' espresso machines that were purchased for each of the centres by the last Administration (as outlined on 15 March 2010, _Official Report_, House of Commons, Column 665W).

Marketing begins in late July, with sale boards going up at the five buildings. Other marketing activities will comprise some print and online advertising, a brochure for interested organisations, a dedicated website and site visits. My Department has looked for cost effective marketing channels, including no-cost and low-cost routes, and will keep the outcomes under review in order to assess effectiveness and progress.

In the meantime, we have taken firm steps to reduce the costs of the unused control centres. For example, the facilities management bill has been reduced by 25 per cent and the utilities bill by 35 per cent. A second review of the facilities management arrangements will result in a further reduction from April 2013. While we will continue to seek to drive down these costs to make savings for the taxpayer, the largest saving will come from finding suitable tenants to take over the buildings.

I want to inform the House of my Department's intention to provide an Authorised Guarantee Agreement to the landlord of the North West Regional Control Centre building. This statement sits alongside a departmental minute I have laid before the House setting out the contingent liability associated with the provision of an Authorised Guarantee Agreement.

As set out in the departmental minute, the lease for the North West Control Centre in Warrington has been assigned to NW Fire Control Ltd, a consortium of four fire and rescue authorities. The consortium will use the building to provide a shared control service. This is positive news, which will result in emergency calls being taken in a specialist, highly resilient, purpose-built centre. We are providing an Authorised Guarantee Agreement to the landlord, as provided for in the lease.

My Department and NW Fire Control Ltd have already entered into a formal agreement regarding the control centre building for the lifetime of the lease, which runs until 2033. As such, we expect there to be no costs to Government from the provision of this Authorised Guarantee Agreement.

It is clearly unsatisfactory that taxpayers have had to foot the bill for this poorly conceived and poorly implemented project from the last Administration, and taxpayers will no doubt resent such expensive buildings lying empty because of the botched procurement and handling of FireControl under the last Government. However, the Coalition Government has taken firm action to protect the public purse from the botched programme and sought to minimise the cost of these inherited liabilities, in as far as we are able to given the constraints of the contracts that were signed.

Ministers will continue to keep Parliament informed of progress.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/corporate/localstatistics,Local statistics,"* * *

I would like to update Hon. Members on changes to the publication of the Department's statistics.

Today my Department has announced its response to the consultation on proposed changes to the Department's statistics. From October this year, we will no longer publish statistics at a government office regional level. Instead the Department will plan to publish, where appropriate, statistics for Local Enterprise Partnerships and upper-tier local authorities, complementing existing statistics by local authority.

The Coalition Government has abolished regional government. The unelected Regional Assemblies/Regional Chambers, the Government Offices for the Regions, the Regional FiReControl programme, the Regional Development Agencies have been terminated, as is intended for the Regional Spatial Strategies, subject to the strategic environment assessment process outlined in my statement of 3 September 2012, _Official Report, Column 5WS_.

The government office regions were an inefficient tier of administration based on arbitrary boundaries. They did not reflect the areas that local residents most identified with, nor were they areas with common economic problems and market conditions, nor were they the most sensible boundaries for coordinating functions such as fire and resilience.

The continuing use of the former government office regional boundaries no longer provides a coherent framework for assessing public policy. Many of the Government's policies now use alternative local geographies, for example Local Enterprise Partnerships, the New Homes Bonus and City Deals. Publishing statistics at a regional level is no longer necessary or informative, and we see little point in producing statistics at taxpayers' expense for their own sake.

The old regional classifications are also misleading - they fail to quantify both the pockets of deprivation that can exist within regions or the differences between rural and urban England, and there is an inconsistency of approach to the size and population of each government region. They are arbitrary lines on a map that have no resonance - in contrast to England's long-standing cities, boroughs and counties which have a real sense of local identity and popular support, dating back centuries in many cases. England has no history of regional government, whereas it does have a great tradition of local governance that this Government wishes to strengthen.

There is also a European dimension to the regions in the form of Eurostat's Nomenclature of Units for Territorial Statistics standard (the appropriately named 'NUTS Regulations'). It is the view of Ministers that the NUTS1 hierarchy is no longer appropriate for Structural Funds in England moving forward from 2014. Ministers reject the notion of a 'Europe of the Regions' where nation-states and national Parliaments are sidelined, and replaced with distant regional governments answerable only to a federal European super-state. Dismantling such arbitrary, unelected regional administrative structures will assist in that goal.

Ministers have carefully considered all the representations made in the consultation. I would note that, for the purposes of historic comparisons, nothing prevents academics and other interested parties from compiling and analysing the open local authority data by the old regional government boundaries, if they wish.

The consultation response also notes the implementation of a new form on local authority housing statistics which reduces and rationalises the data we are asking local authorities to provide, reducing burdens on local government. It also reports on the responses on Land Use Change Statistics which confirmed their importance for monitoring the outcomes of planning policy.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/corporate/2212914,Housing and growth,"* * *

_Draft text of the statement - may differ from the delivered version._

With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a statement on housing and planning.

  * The Coalition Government inherited a legacy where house building had fallen to its lowest rates since the 1920s.
  * A top-down planning system that built nothing but resentment.
  * A regime of regional planning quangos that created paralysis and confrontation. After six years of preparation, by the general election, less than 60 councils had completed local plans.

The result was no development. No regeneration. No community benefits.

This Government wants to get the economy growing.

To remove unnecessary red tape.

To support locally-led sustainable development.

In November, the Government published a comprehensive [housing strategy](http://www.communities.gov.uk/housing/about/keymeasures/) to support a thriving, active and stable housing market.

In March, we published a [National Planning Policy Framework](http://www.communities.gov.uk/planningandbuilding/planningsystem/planningpolicy/planningpolicyframework/) to condense 1,000 pages of central planning guidance to just 50.

Housebuilding is up - 29 per cent higher in 2011 than in 2009. But there is more to do.

So today, my Department is announcing a further series of common sense measures to promote house building and support locally-led economic growth.

The technical details are laid out in a [Written Statement](http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/newsroom/2211838) which has been laid before the House. I will summarise the key points for Hon Members.

  * Following on from [Sir Adrian Montague's independent report](http://www.communities.gov.uk/housing/privaterentedhousing/investment/) on supporting the private rented sector, we are providing £200 million of new funding to support institutional investment in high-quality rented homes.
  * Thanks to the action we have taken to tackle the last Government's deficit, we are passing on the lower costs of borrowing. We will be issuing a debt guarantee for up to £10 billion to support private investment in the private rented sector and in new affordable housing.
  * We will support up to an additional 15,000 affordable homes through the use of loan guarantees, flexibilities and capital funding.
  * We also intend to extend our successful refurbishment programme to bring an additional 5,000 existing empty homes back into use. The last Government wanted to demolish Victorian terraces with John Prescott's Pathfinder programme. By contrast, we are getting homes back into productive use.
  * In total we will invest another £300m in these measures to support new affordable homes and bring empty homes into use.
  * We actively want to support home ownership, which fell under the last Parliament despite a Labour pledge to increase it by a million.  
We are extending our successful FirstBuy scheme for first time buyers, with an additional £280 million of funding, helping up to 16,500 additional first time buyers to purchase a home.
  * To free up more brownfield land for development and regeneration, we will accelerate the release of surplus public sector land and empty offices through a targeted programme of transfers from other Government bodies.
  * We will work with local authorities and developers to unlock locally-supported large sites. Just last week, we were back to unblock the Eastern Quarry in the Ebbsfleet Valley - a major ex-industrial sitethat had stalled for a decade.

We are working with local communities and councils. But some councils need to raise their game, by failing to make planning decisions in a timely way. Planning delays create uncertainty both for local residents and local firms. So we will introduce a series of practical measures to help speed up planning decisions and appeals, and major infrastructure.

Some complex developments take time to assemble. So we are allowing for developers to extend the duration of existing planning permissions.

We are making it easier for developers to change unrealistic Section 106 agreements. A development which isn't built means no Section 106 payments. Common sense reforms will result in more regeneration, more housing and more community benefits.

Sustainable development should go hand in hand with environmental safeguards.

I can confirm that we have protected the Green Belt, in line with our commitment in the Coalition Agreement.

It has always the case that councils can amend local Green Belt boundaries should they wish - and we will support councils which choose to. This can include introducing new Green Belt protection around new large developments.

There is considerable previously developed land in many Green Belt areas. We encourage councils to make best use of this land, whilst protecting the openness of the Green Belt in line with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework.

If we are to protect our countryside, we need to focus more growth in our town centres. So we are introducing measures to make it easier to turn empty commercial buildings into housing. Our high streets will benefit from a greater resident population, increasing footfall and supporting local shops.

As a nation, we have great pride in our homes. We want to make it easier for families to undertake home improvements - such as building a new conservatory. So we will be seeking to simplify and increase permitted development rights for householders. Cutting back municipal red tape in this way could provide a particular boost for small traders and small builders.

Mr Speaker, These practical measures build on the housing, local government finance and planning reforms already in play.

Giving more power to individuals, to communities, to councils.

Providing new incentives to support local shops, local firms and local economic growth.

Delivering sustainable development and getting Britain building.

I commend this statement to the House.

Today my Department is publishing the thirteenth group of reports presenting the findings from research projects commissioned by the previous administration.

This Administration inherited a significant backlog of unpublished reports that were commissioned by the previous government which we have been publishing in groups themed on a particular topic.

The reports and findings are of general policy interest, but do not relate to forthcoming policy announcements. We are publishing these documents in the interests of transparency and as part of our Freedom of Information commitment to publish the results of all commissioned research.

The [16 reports](http://www.communities.gov.uk/archived/general-content/corporate/researcharchive/volume13planning/) published today represent the findings from fifteen research projects at a total cost of £1,453,505. These findings cover the topics of building, planning and the environment.

### Planning reports

> (i) _ **Evaluation of minerals policy statements (2 volumes)** _. This report by the British Geological Survey considered the implementation of a number of the Minerals Policy Statements and Minerals Policy Guidance notes, and evaluated the impacts of the policy's implementation. This report was commissioned in January 2010 at a cost of £60,000.
> 
> (ii) _ **Investigating the influence of settlement pattern and morphology on the sterilisation of shallow coal resources** _. This report by the British Geological Survey assessed the impact on shallow coal resources of using separation zones around urban areas. This report was commissioned in January 2010 at a cost of £9,000.
> 
> (iii) ** _Research to understand the rural impacts of Regional Spatial Strategies_ **. This report by Land Use Consultants noted that the Regional Strategies were not rural proofed, had an urban-centred approach and planned housing provision in rural areas was on a declining trend. This report was commissioned in 2009 at a cost of £21,542.
> 
> (iv) _ **A quality local development management service** _. The last Government's Killian Pretty Report recommended that Government should review the then existing national planning indicator (National Indicator 157) on timeliness for progressing planning applications and proposed a new satisfaction with the planning application service indicator. There was concern from applicants, local planning authorities and others that the performance regime focused on the 8 and 13 week timescale targets had unintended effects on behaviours and outcomes. In response the Department commissioned research into alternatives. The research report by Addison & Associates with Arup recommended monitoring 37 different indicators. This report was commissioned in November 2009 at a cost of £72,816.  
   
(v) _ **A tool to assess the Impact of EU Directives on UK Sub National Planning Policies (2 reports)** _. This research by Ove Arup aimed to develop a tool to assess the impact of future EU directives on national planning policies. Directives used in developing this tool included the Marine Strategy Directive, the Water Framework Directive and the Habitats Directive. It noted that EU Directives create significant tensions with the need for development to met demand. The Marine Strategy Directive would cost key business sectors between £439 million to £1.2 billion in additional costs. The research was commissioned in 2009 at a cost of £81,025.

### Building and the environment reports

> (vi) _ **Mapping the standard of existing stock and its turnover** _. This report by Building Research Establishment considered the work to develop a model of the existing housing stock in England and Wales, which could be used in assessing the impact of current and future policy in relation to energy use, carbon emissions and water consumption. This report was commissioned in 2008 at a cost of £56,305.
> 
> (vii) _ **Case studies of change of use of dwellings** _. This report by Faber Maunsell looked at achieving satisfactory acoustic performance for buildings to be converted from industry or commercial use to residential use. Although sound insulation was the main concern of this project, all other relevant requirements of the Building Regulations were to be considered and methods of compliance outlined. This report was commissioned in 2003 at a cost of £115,860.
> 
> (viii) _ **Lessons from Stamford Brook: Understanding the gap between designed and real performance** _. This report by Leeds Metropolitan University conveyed the results of a research designed to evaluate the extent to which low carbon housing standards could be achieved in a large commercial housing development and incorporated into future Building Regulations. The report was commissioned in 2002 and the department's contribution was £215,000.
> 
> (ix) _ **The safety of stairs investigated over a range of rise and goings** _. This report by Building Research Establishment considered people's use of stairs. It conducted analysis of subjective opinions, objective behaviour on stairs and foot placement data to establish the effect of guidance within Part K (Protection from falling, collision and impact) on the design of public, private and institutional stairs and the risk of falling. The report was commissioned in 2003 at a cost of £219,682.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/corporate/2159464,Unpublished research reports: Fire and rescue services,"* * *

Today the Government is publishing the eleventh group of reports presenting the findings from research projects commissioned by the previous administration.

There is a significant backlog of unpublished reports that were produced by the previous government which we will be publishing in groups themed on a particular topic.

The reports and findings are of general policy interest, but do not relate to forthcoming policy announcements. We are publishing these documents in the interests of transparency and as part of our Freedom of Information commitment to publish the results of all commissioned research.

The [20 reports](http://www.communities.gov.uk/archived/general-content/corporate/researcharchive/volume11fire/) listed below represent the findings from seventeen research projects at a total cost to taxpayers of £1,042,850. These findings cover the topic of fire.

> (i) _ **Review of the adequacy and impact of integrated risk management planning in the fire and rescue service** _. This report, commissioned in 2008, evaluated the adequacy and overall impact of integrated risk management planning on the efficiency of the fire and rescue service and on national fire-related outcomes.
> 
> (ii) _ **Asset management in fire and rescue authorities** _. This report evaluated the extent to which fire and rescue authorities manage their property assets to ensure effective service provision and achieve value for money, and to make recommendations for improvement.
> 
> (iii) _ **A review of current processes for operational training and development in the fire and rescue service** _. The review was set up to provide part of the evidence base needed to inform the debate about fire and rescue service operational training and development. The project was also to identify good practice for wider dissemination and look for opportunities to improve and strength training for the future.
> 
> (iv) _ **Effectiveness of operational intervention - Gap analysis paper** _. This report by Qinetiq Limited identified gaps in the evidence base that may need to be filled in order to develop a computer model to simulate fire fighting operations. The report makes suggestions for how these gaps could be filled.
> 
> (v) _ **Effectiveness of operational intervention - Model development paper** _. This paper documented the development of a trial computer model to investigate the effectiveness of operational intervention at fire fighting incidents.
> 
> (vi) _ **Effectiveness of sprinklers in housing, commercial, public and other buildings** _. This research was commissioned in response to concerns and pressure from the sector that the provision of sprinklers represents the most cost effective way to maintain the downward pressure on fire deaths and associated economic losses.
> 
> (vii) ** _Impact of the fire fighter awareness campaign_ **. The fire and rescue service has struggled to recruit women for operational fire fighter roles. At the time of the study women made up less than 3% of the fire and rescue service's operational workforce. Research has shown that one of the key reasons why women are not becoming fire fighters is the service's image and the lack of awareness of fire fighting as a career for women.
> 
> (viii) _ **The development of a centrally held line-by-line fire and rescue service human resource data** _. This study was an exploration of the possibility of using a different method for collecting various items of data from the fire and rescue service.
> 
> (ix) _ **Lower cost domestic sprinkler (LCDS) systems - Evaluation of small scale pilot trials in Fire and Rescue Services (incorporating Version 10 of the draft DCLG Design Guide)** _. The aim of this report was to record the progress made by Fire and rescue Services in installing lower cost domestic sprinkler (LCDS) systems as described in Version 10 of the draft DCLG Design Guide.
> 
> (x) _ **The shape, form and function of operational guidance for the fire and rescue service** _. This report by Greenstreet Berman presented the findings of work carried out to determine the shape, form and function of future operational guidance. A human factors approach was applied to ensure that future operational guidance is: fit for purpose; presented in a style appropriate for the target audience and the context; appropriately organised; and easily accessible.
> 
> (xi) _ **Fire investigation reports workshop: Workshop summary report** _. Fire and rescue services undertake fire investigations and complete reports. Many of these reports contain valuable information which could be used nationally to inform practice and fire safety. This is a report of a workshop sponsored by DCLG and Chief Fire Officers Association (CFOA) to discuss how information from fire investigations could be better used and shared.
> 
> (xii) _ **The competencies and skills for incident command: An initial exploration** _. This report by the Health and Safety Laboratory was the first stage of a larger project to look at incident command in the fire and rescue service. The findings of this first stage provide an examination of the different psychological components of successful incident command as well as the identification of the competencies, skills and personal qualities and attributes required of an incident commander.
> 
> (xiii) _ **Comparison of European fire statistics** _. This report by Greenstreet Berman Ltd examined the statistics collected by European countries regarding the consequence and incidence of fire. Technical experts in 24 European states responded to an online questionnaire explaining how their country collects fire data. The contractors then contrast different approaches to fire data collection and make suggestions for which countries' data could be directly compared.
> 
> (xiv) _ **Developing a model to estimate the economic cost of Special Service Incidents in England** _. This report by Entec UK Ltd. investigated the possibility of assessing the costs associated with Special Service Incidents in England, with the primary focus being the costs to the Fire and Rescue Service.
> 
> (xv) _ **A review of the Fire Kills Fire Safety Education Prog** _ramme. This report by Greenstreet Berman Ltd. contains the results of a project to measure the level of awareness (amongst community fire safety staff) and use of the Fire Kills Fire Safety Education Programme packs within the Fire and Rescue Service. The report contains case studies providing information on the fire safety education carried out by six fire and rescue services and is based on surveys from 2007.
> 
> (xvi) _ **Collation and analysis of Fire and Rescue Service expenditure data** _. This report by Spikes Cavell and Co. provided an overview of the results of a project carried out to provide a better understanding of the size, structure and opportunities within the fire market. The report identified opportunities for collaboration and procurement efficiencies.

### Children and young people strategy

> (xvii) _ **Informing the development of the fire and rescue service strategy for working with children and young people: consulting with the youth sector** _. This report by the National Youth Agency provided the findings of a consultation with the youth sector about the draft children and young people strategy 2010-2013. The report is based on the findings from an online survey, a series of semi-structured interviews and a focus group with young people.
> 
> (xviii) _ **Evaluation of the children and young people Strategy: 2006-2010** _. This report by GfK NOP Social Research provided an understanding of the awareness and use of the 2006-2010 children and young people strategy, as well as suggestions of how the strategy could be improved in the future.

### Impact of modernisation on the fire and rescue service

> (xix) _ **The impact of modernisation on fire and rescue services** _. This report by Actica Consulting Ltd. assessed the impact of the portfolio of change projects initiated by DCLG on Fire and Rescue Services in England. Senior members of staff were interviewed and provided key documents on which the findings and recommendations were based.
> 
> (xx) _ **Project planning for fire and resilience directorate projects that impact fire and rescue services** _. This report by Actica Consulting Ltd. follows on from the previous report assessing the impact of modernisation on the fire and rescue service. It contains the findings and recommendations of a short study to identify options to co-ordinate demands on fire and rescue service demands.

These reports and findings are of general policy interest, but do not relate to forthcoming policy announcements and are not a reflection of the current Government's policies and priorities. DCLG is publishing these reports in the interests of transparency.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/corporate/2239809,Business Rates,"* * *

I am today announcing the Government's intention to postpone the next business rates revaluation in England to 2017. Primary legislation will be brought forward through the Growth and Infrastructure Bill which will shortly be laid before Parliament.

Business rates are the third biggest outgoing for local firms after rent and staff costs. This decision will avoid local firms and local shops facing unexpected hikes in their business rate bills over the next five years. As business rates are linked to inflation, there will be no real terms increase in rates over this period. This reform will provide certainty for business to plan and invest, supporting local economic growth.

Since the last revaluation (based on 2008 valuations), the economy and property market have faced exceptional changes. A revaluation at this point would be likely to result in sharp changes to business rate bills in many parts of the country and in many sectors. Tax stability is vital to businesses looking to grow and help improve the economy.

The Government is committed to maintaining up to date rate bills through regular five yearly revaluations in England which will resume after 2017, once the economy has had a chance to recover fully from the financial and fiscal crisis this Government inherited from the last Administration.

These measures complement the local retention of business rates being introduced through the Local Government Finance Bill which will give councils new incentives to support local firms and local shops, and also complements the new power to introduce local business rate discounts, the automation of small business rate relief and the abolition of the unfair 'ports tax' all enacted through the Localism Act 2011.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/corporate/lepfunding,Core funding for Local Enterprise Partnerships,"* * *

BIS Minister of State for Business and Enterprise (Michael Fallon) and the DCLG Minister of State for Housing (Mark Prisk) are today announcing that £25m of Government funding will be made available to support local enterprise partnerships in their pursuit of economic growth.

Government's goal is to promote strong, sustainable and balanced growth across the UK. Local enterprise partnerships are central to our approach to driving local economic growth and for ensuring that every locality is able to fulfil its potential. Local enterprise partnerships are voluntary partnerships of business and civic leaders, working across local economic areas, and have a vitally important role in identifying opportunities for private sector growth and addressing local barriers to growth through the united efforts of their partners.

Local enterprise partnerships have also been encouraged to identify local barriers to growth where government action can address some of the specific barriers. Ministers across government are committed to supporting local enterprise partnerships achieve their local growth priorities and tackle the barriers to progress.

In response to recent strong representations BIS and DCLG have decided to offer jointly up to £250k pa of matched core funding to local enterprise partnerships for the remainder of this Parliament (until 2014/15), subject to satisfactory proposals being received. We will offer each local enterprise partnership a one-off initial payment of £125k for the remainder of this financial year to provide immediate support, with subsequent years funding dependent on matched funding from local partners. Where matched by funds locally the overall funding pot could equate up to £45m over this period. With this offer of core resources, local enterprise partnerships will be asked to ensure that they have a clear set of priorities for local growth in place.

Local enterprise partnerships will remain voluntary business and civic partnerships to drive sustainable private sector growth and job creation in their area. This offer of core resource funding will provide more capacity for local enterprise partnerships to drive forward their growth priorities, allow them to do longer term resource planning and strengthen support and autonomy of the business-led boards.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/corporate/2180566,"Unpublished research reports: Building, planning and the environment","* * *

Today the Government is publishing a group of reports presenting the findings from research projects commissioned by the previous administration.

We are publishing these documents in the interests of transparency and as part of our Freedom of Information commitment to publish the results of all commissioned research. For transparency, all completed work is being published regardless of format or robustness.

The [seven reports](http://www.communities.gov.uk/archived/general-content/corporate/researcharchive/volume12building/) published today represent the findings from seven research projects at a total cost of £190,320. These findings cover the topics of building, planning and the environment.

This research provides an improved evidence base to understand the costs, benefits and practical implications of applying the Lifetime Home Standard to new build housing development. In particular it develops cost analysis which more accurately reflects the likely contribution of access standards to the cumulative impact of regulation on housing supply, and sets out clearly the likely impact on different housing typologies, and on site density.

Although these reports are from the last Administration, they do touch upon current government policy. The Coalition Government has set out in the National Planning Policy Framework that Local Plans must take into account the housing needs of a range of users including older and disabled people. In November's Housing Strategy, this Government also set out its expectation that new development should have a diverse mix of property types, including more accessible designs such as the Lifetime Home Standard. However, we do not intend to introduce national regulation. We believe that decisions should be made at a local level, in proportion to local need and aligned with other local housing support and information services.

### Lifetime Homes Standards

> (i) ** _Modelling the current and potential accessibility of the housing stock_ ** - This report by Building Research Establishment considers the accessibility of the existing housing stock in England with particular reference to its utility for older and disabled people. The report uses data from the English Home Condition Survey to identify the frequency and suitability of a range of built features within homes to arrive at an overall assessment of their accessibility and future adaptability. The report was commissioned in 2006 at a cost of £56,305.
> 
> (ii) _ **Assessing the cost of Lifetime Homes Standards** _ - This report by the Building Cost Information Service (BCIS) looks at establishing the cost impact of introducing the Lifetime Homes Standards in private sector housing, identifying best practice and the potential cost savings that can be delivered through efficiency of design. The report was commissioned in 2009 at a cost of £34,818.
> 
> (iii) ** _Health benefits of Lifetime Home Standards_ ** - This report by the Building Research Establishment sets out findings from work to determine the relative benefits of building to the Lifetime Home Standard. Utilising existing data from the Housing Health and Safety Rating System, the research evaluated the health costs associated with the different levels of harm relating either to direct NHS costs or to societal costs. The report was commissioned in 2009 at a cost of £21,302.
> 
> (iv) ** _Lifetime Homes: Technical forum_ ** - This report by Habinteg Housing Association captures discussions and recommendations which emerged from a Technical Working Group established to test proposals for improving guidance in the Lifetime Home Standard. This report was commissioned in 2009 at a cost of £17,448.
> 
> (v) ** _Analysis of distribution of housing typologies in Public and Private Sector and typical compatibility with the Lifetime Home Standard_ ** - This research conducted by Levitt Bernstein considers the impact of and current compliance with the 16 point standard of _Lifetime Homes Lifetime Neighbourhoods - a National strategy for Housing in an Ageing Society_. Mindful that the standards were originally developed with very suburban 2, 3 and 4 bed detached housing in mind, there was a need to review the 16 point standard and consider the implications of applying it to current and emerging new build housing typologies in England and Wales. The research develops and agrees a model of the variety and distribution of future housing typologies in England and Wales and analyses what impact the application of Lifetime Homes Standards will have on varying house typologies. The study focussed primarily on private sector housing. This report was commissioned in 2009 at a cost of £34,360.
> 
> (vi) ** _Impact on site density of Lifetime Homes_ ** - This research work conducted by Levitt Bernstein is an extension to an earlier piece of work and represents an initial exploration of the impact that the application of Lifetime Homes Standards is likely to have on the site density of private sector housing. It concentrates on low to medium density suburban developments, typically 30-60 dwellings per hectare (dph). The research consisted of a theoretical analysis to calculate the effect on plot size of various increases to plan footprints; an assessment of impact on density on a small sample of typical site layouts in addition to feed back from industry about site density and marketability. This report was commissioned in 2009 at a cost of £16,087.
> 
> (vii) _ **Design of Lifetime homes** _ - This research conducted by Hunt Thomson Architects seeks to evaluate the impact on designing private sectors homes to meet the Lifetime Home Standard, and in particular to understand the likely impact of seeking to minimise both increase in cost and any necessary increase in the overall size of properties by adopting the standard. The project utilised analysis of a range of typical speculative housing development plans and compares these designs with entirely new housing layouts which incorporate the 16 elements of the Lifetime Home Standard. This report was commissioned in 2009 at a cost of £10,000.

At a time when public budgets must be reduced, the new Government wants to ensure its research delivers best possible value for money for the taxpayer and that sums expended are reasonable in relation to the public policy benefits obtained. My department has put in place new scrutiny and challenge processes for future research.

Any new projects will be scrutinised to ensure the methodology is sound and that all options for funding are explored at an early stage. This includes using existing work from other organisations, joint funding projects with other departments or organisations and taking work forward in-house.

Copies of these reports are available on the Department for Communities and Local Government [website](http://www.communities.gov.uk/archived/general-content/corporate/researcharchive/volume12building/). Copies have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.

The Coalition Government's number one priority is to get the economy growing. We must create the conditions that support local economic growth and remove barriers that stop local businesses creating jobs and getting Britain building again.

In November, the Government published a comprehensive housing strategy and we have rapidly put in place measures set out in the strategy to support a thriving, active and stable housing market.

We are reforming the Right to Buy by significantly increasing the discounts available to tenants to buy their own home. We launched our NewBuy scheme allowing people access to mortgages with only a 5 per cent deposit. And to unblock stalled sites with the capacity for up to 16,000 homes we launched the £570 million Get Britain Building fund. We also announced plans to dispose of public sector land with the capacity to deliver 100,000 homes, and invested £770 million in infrastructure for housing and growth through the Growing Places Fund.

House building starts across England were 29 per cent higher in 2011 compared to 2009. But there is far more to do to provide homes to meet Britain's demographic needs and to help generate local economic growth.

### Increasing investment in the private rented sector

The rented sector already provides good quality homes for many young people, professionals and families. But growth has been constrained by the lack of large scale investment. We invited Sir Adrian Montague to report on the barriers to institutional investment and intend to take up Sir Adrian's key recommendation. Today I can announce that we will be investing £200 million in housing sites to ensure that the high-quality rented homes that are needed are available to institutional investors quickly. And we will be establishing a taskforce to bring together developers, management bodies and institutional investors to broker deals and deliver more rented homes.

The Government will also use its hard earned fiscal credibility to pass on lower costs of borrowing to support the long-term delivery of new rental homes. To give institutional investors the assurance they need to invest in this area we will be issuing a debt guarantee for up to £10 billion for this scheme and the affordable housing scheme set out below. Under the scheme, the Government will enable providers to raise debt with a Government guarantee, where they commit to investing in additional new-build rented homes. From tomorrow, the Government will be inviting expressions of interest from companies wishing to benefit from the scheme. It is expected that housing associations, property management companies and developers will be amongst those to benefit.

### Affordable Housing Guarantees and tackling empty homes

The need for affordable housing remains high. We will therefore be extending the use of guarantees to cover borrowing needed to deliver more affordable homes. Building on the success of the Affordable Homes Programme, the Government will invite bids to provide up to an additional 15,000 affordable homes through the use of loan guarantees, asset management flexibilities and capital funding. We also intend to extend our successful refurbishment programme to bring an additional 5,000 existing empty homes back into use. In total we will invest another £300 million.

### Helping first time buyers

To complement supporting the rented sector, we also want to help those who want to get onto and move up the housing ladder.

Building on our existing schemes, we will continue to support house building and to help people into home ownership through Newbuy - making it easier to access a mortgage with only a 5 per cent deposit. We are working with the Home Builders Federation and the Council of Mortgage Lenders to increase take up and grow the number of builders and lenders in the scheme. I welcome Monday's announcement that Aldermore, have joined the scheme - taking the number of lenders up to six, over 70 per cent of the market. Homebuilders and lenders will work together on a concerted marketing campaign over the Autumn to raise consumer awareness and understanding of scheme.

We will also allocate an additional £280 million, with a matching contribution from house builders, to extend our very successful FirstBuy scheme to March 2014. This will allow up to 16,500 additional first time buyers to purchase a home.

### Accelerating large housing schemes

The need for new homes is acute, and supply remains constrained. There are many large housing schemes in areas of high housing demand that could provide real benefit to local communities once delivered. But, large schemes are complicated and raise a wide range of complex issues that can be difficult to resolve.

Building on success in working with Kent local authorities and developers to unlock major housing opportunities at Eastern Quarry in the Ebbsfleet Valley, the Government will work in partnership with local authorities, scheme promoters and communities to accelerate delivery of locally-supported, major housing sites. These will be sites where there is local support for growth, strong demand for new homes, and good prospects for early delivery.

Off-site construction can create skilled jobs, improve the quality of homes and ultimately bring down costs. An industry-led group convened by DCLG and BIS, will look in detail at the barriers holding back the growth of this part of the sector and how increased use of such techniques can be incentivised. We will ask this advisory group of experts to prepare an proposals by Budget 2013, with the aim of improving the efficiency of housing supply and unlocking high value jobs in the UK.

Thanks to the Government's credible fiscal strategy, homeowners are benefiting from historically low interest rates. However, the private sector needs to be able to access both finance and land to build the homes we need. The Funding for Lending Scheme, run by the Bank of England with the approval of the Government, provides strong incentives for banks and building societies to boost lending, including mortgages and loans to businesses

### Getting surplus public sector land back into use

In response to emerging conclusions from a review chaired by Tony Pidgley, Chairman of the Berkeley Group, the Government will accelerate the release of surplus public sector land by strengthening the role of Homes and Communities Agency outside London through a targeted programme of transfers from other Government Departments and agencies. We will also work to accelerate disposals by preparing the land for market and providing a single 'shop window' for all surplus public sector land. We will work with the Mayor of London with a view to developing a similar approach in London, and to resolve how other measures are delivered for the benefit of Londoners.

### Reducing planning delays

To get more homes built - and more workshops, factories and offices - we need a planning system which works proactively to support the growth that this country needs.

The National Planning Policy Framework is a major step forward. It has been widely welcomed by business, and as a result of its positive influence we are already seeing accelerated plan-making and more positive decision-taking.

We are clear that local people - and local authorities - must be at the heart of planning. The last government tried top-down imposition of growth and unequivocally failed. The imposition of Regional Strategies built nothing but resentment, with house building falling to its lowest peacetime rate since the 1920s.

The Localism Act has put the power to plan back in the hands of communities, but with this power comes responsibility: a responsibility to meet their needs for development and growth, and to deal quickly and effectively with proposals that will deliver homes, jobs and facilities.

Today we are announcing a series of additional measures to drive the effective implementation of these reforms and remove unnecessary bureaucracy that can hinder sustainable growth.

Given the importance of efficient and effective planning decisions for the economy, we need to ensure that where there are clear failures in performance, that applicants are able to access a better service. We propose to legislate to allow applications to be decided by the Planning Inspectorate, if the local authority has a track record of consistently poor performance in the speed or quality of its decisions. Planning is a quasi-judicial process: justice delayed is justice denied. It is unfair to all parties for local planning authorities simply to fail to make timely decisions on a planning application - creating uncertainty both for applicants and local residents.

In support of this we will also require more transparent reporting of council performance on planning, and will be working with the Local Government Association to increase the use of Planning Performance Agreements for major schemes - which commit both applicants and planning authorities to a clear timetable for determining proposals. In addition, we intend to give Planning Inspectors more power to initiate an award of costs in planning appeal proceedings, where it is clear that an application has not been handled as it should have been with due process.

Swift determination of appeals by the Planning Inspectorate is also of critical importance. We will consult shortly on options to speed up planning appeals - and for a new fast-track procedure for some small commercial appeals. I have also instructed the Planning Inspectorate with immediate effect to divert resources to prioritise all major economic and housing related appeals, to ensure applicants receive a response in the quickest possible time.

I have also extended a measure that allows developers the chance to seek additional time to get their sites up and running before planning permission expires, for an additional year. This measure will cut the costs of getting developments back on track.

Getting the infrastructure projects that the country's economic success relies upon underway as swiftly as possible is also a top priority. The planning regime for Major Infrastructure which deals with many of these cases is bedding in well and is bringing benefits through its streamlined and more certain processes. We want to ensure that this planning regime rightly focuses on the most important schemes whilst also extending the benefits of it to other forms of development which are of national importance.

To achieve this we now intend to review the thresholds for some of the existing categories in the regime, and also to bring new categories of commercial and business development into the regime - making it possible for such schemes, where they are of sufficient significance, to be considered and determined at a national level. We will also work to extend the principle of a one-stop-shop for non-planning consents for major infrastructure, and amend the Special Parliamentary procedures which apply to major infrastructure to ensure they are fit for purpose.

### Reducing the cumulative burden of red tape

It is vital that the affordable housing element of Section 106 agreements negotiated during different economic conditions is not allowed to undermine the viability of sites and prevent any construction of new housing. This results in no development, no regeneration and no community benefits at all when agreements are no longer economically viable.

The Government estimates that up to 75,000 new homes are currently stalled due to site viability. S106 is an important tool to provide affordable housing and we welcome the flexible approach that many councils have already taken to renegotiating these agreements where necessary. The Government is also acting to get developers and councils around the table through its new mediation scheme. However, given the current imperative for growth, we need to do more.

The Government will now introduce legislation, to be effective in early 2013, which will allow any developer of sites which are unviable because of the number of affordable homes, to appeal with immediate effect. The Planning Inspectorate will be instructed to assess how many affordable homes would need to be removed from the Section 106 agreement for the site to be viable in current economic conditions. The Planning Inspectorate would then, as necessary, set aside the existing Section 106 agreement for a three year period, in favour of a new agreement with fewer affordable homes. We would encourage councils to take the opportunity before legislation comes into effect to seek negotiated solutions where possible.

Alongside this, the Government is also consulting on legislation that would allow developers to renegotiate non-viable Section 106 agreements entered into prior to April 2010.  
   
There is concern that the array of local and national standards used in different parts the country is complex and counter-productive: confusing local residents, councillors and developers. I am announcing today a fundamental and urgent review led by Government working with interested parties to rationalise these standards. This review will result in a clear plan of action by next spring, including legislative approaches if a significant rationalisation cannot be agreed.

### Supporting locally-led development

We have previously made clear the importance we attach to delivering new large-scale settlements. The recovery criteria already includes large residential developments. To align this with the call-in process, I will also carefully consider the use of call-in for major new settlements with larger than local impacts.

To support locally-led development, communities will share in benefits including the New Homes Bonus, Community Infrastructure Levy contributions towards local infrastructure, and the financial benefits of business rates discounts and forthcoming business rates retention from April 2013.

The Green Belt is an important protection against urban sprawl, providing a 'green lung' around towns and cities. The Coalition Agreement commits the Government to safeguarding Green Belt and other environmental designations, which they have been in the new National Planning Policy Framework. The Localism Act allows for the abolition of Labour's Regional Spatial Strategies which sought to bulldoze the Green Belt around thirty towns and cities across the country, subject to the Strategic Environmental Assessment process, as outlined in my Statement of 3 September 2012, Official Report, Column 5WS.

As has always been the case, councils can review local designations to promote growth. We encourage councils to use the flexibilities set out in the National Planning Policy Framework to tailor the extent of Green Belt land in their areas to reflect local circumstances. Where Green Belt is considered in reviewing or drawing up Local Plans, we will support councils to move quickly through the process by prioritising their Local Plan examinations... There is considerable previously developed land in many Green Belt areas, which could be put to more productive use. We encourage Councils to make best use of this land, whilst protecting the openness of the Green Belt in line with the requirements in the National Planning Policy Framework.

### Helping homeowners improve their homes

As a nation, we have great pride in our homes, and I want to make it easier for families to undertake home improvements: not just to cut red tape and strengthen individual homeowners' rights, but also to help generate economic activity which will support small traders in particular.

I am announcing today a further package of simplification measures to remove red tape and ease the burden on local authorities. We will consult shortly on changes to increase existing permitted development rights for extensions to homes and business premises in non protected areas for a three-year period. This will mean less municipal red tape to build a conservatory and similar small-scale home improvement and free up valuable resources in local authorities.

### Getting empty offices into use

We have already undertaken a series of measures to make change of use easier, to help get empty buildings back into productive use.

We will introduce permitted development rights to enable change of use from commercial to residential purposes, while providing the opportunity for authorities to seek a local exemption where they believe there will be an adverse economic impact. This common sense measure will help the regeneration of our towns and cities. Our high streets will benefit from a greater resident population, increasing footfall and supporting local shops.

This package of measures will ensure that the reforms which we have made to the planning system are implemented as effectively as possible, and that the planning system plays as full a role as possible in supporting local jobs and local firms.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/fire/firenationalframework,Fire and Rescue National Framework for England,"* * *

I have today published the Fire and Rescue National Framework for England. The Framework resets the relationship between fire and rescue authorities and Government. One of the key principles of which is to acknowledge the proficiency and experience of fire and rescue authorities; and to allow them the freedom and flexibility to deliver the services for which they are respected and renowned without Whitehall prescription.

The priorities in the Framework are for fire and rescue authorities to:

  * identify and assess the full range of foreseeable fire and rescue related risks their area faces, make provision for prevention and protection activities and to respond to incidents appropriately
  * work in partnership with their communities and a wide range of partners locally and nationally to deliver their service; and
  * be accountable to communities for the service they provide.

Fire and rescue authorities face new challenges: the need to deal with the continuing threat of terrorism, the impact of climate change, and the impacts of an ageing population, against a backdrop of change and the need to cut the national deficit. The Framework enables fire and rescue authorities to efficiently deliver their services; including working collaboratively with other fire and rescue authorities, or with other organisations, to improve public safety and cost effectiveness. Principally, it is to local communities, not central government, that fire and rescue authorities are accountable.

The Framework delivers on the Government commitment in its response to the Fire Future Reports, to clearly define national resilience and to set out clear roles and responsibilities in relation to national resilience. The Framework also sets out arrangements for fire and rescue authorities to collectively engage with Government on national resilience issues through a new Fire and Rescue Strategic Resilience Board. Through this Board, we will take a collaborative approach to national resilience that is based on and drawn from local capability, expertise, knowledge and leadership.

The Framework has an open-ended duration which gives fire and rescue authorities greater certainty. The high level, strategic nature of the Framework should mean that it will remain unchanged for the medium to long term.

Copies of the Fire and Rescue National Framework for England have been deposited in the Library of the House.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/fire/2153186,Unpublished research reports: Fire and rescue services,"* * *

Today the Government is publishing the eleventh group of reports presenting the findings from research projects commissioned by the previous administration.

There is a significant backlog of unpublished reports that were produced by the previous government which we will be publishing in groups themed on a particular topic.

The reports and findings are of general policy interest, but do not relate to forthcoming policy announcements. We are publishing these documents in the interests of transparency and as part of our Freedom of Information commitment to publish the results of all commissioned research.

The [20 reports](http://www.communities.gov.uk/archived/general-content/corporate/researcharchive/volume11fire/) listed below represent the findings from seventeen research projects at a total cost to taxpayers of £1,042,850. These findings cover the topic of fire.

> (i) _ **Review of the adequacy and impact of integrated risk management planning in the fire and rescue service** _. This report, commissioned in 2008, evaluated the adequacy and overall impact of integrated risk management planning on the efficiency of the fire and rescue service and on national fire-related outcomes.
> 
> (ii) _ **Asset management in fire and rescue authorities** _. This report evaluated the extent to which fire and rescue authorities manage their property assets to ensure effective service provision and achieve value for money, and to make recommendations for improvement.
> 
> (iii) _ **A review of current processes for operational training and development in the fire and rescue service** _. The review was set up to provide part of the evidence base needed to inform the debate about fire and rescue service operational training and development. The project was also to identify good practice for wider dissemination and look for opportunities to improve and strength training for the future.
> 
> (iv) _ **Effectiveness of operational intervention - Gap analysis paper** _. This report by Qinetiq Limited identified gaps in the evidence base that may need to be filled in order to develop a computer model to simulate fire fighting operations. The report makes suggestions for how these gaps could be filled.
> 
> (v) _ **Effectiveness of operational intervention - Model development paper** _. This paper documented the development of a trial computer model to investigate the effectiveness of operational intervention at fire fighting incidents.
> 
> (vi) _ **Effectiveness of sprinklers in housing, commercial, public and other buildings** _. This research was commissioned in response to concerns and pressure from the sector that the provision of sprinklers represents the most cost effective way to maintain the downward pressure on fire deaths and associated economic losses.
> 
> (vii) ** _Impact of the fire fighter awareness campaign_ **. The fire and rescue service has struggled to recruit women for operational fire fighter roles. At the time of the study women made up less than 3% of the fire and rescue service's operational workforce. Research has shown that one of the key reasons why women are not becoming fire fighters is the service's image and the lack of awareness of fire fighting as a career for women.
> 
> (viii) _ **The development of a centrally held line-by-line fire and rescue service human resource data** _. This study was an exploration of the possibility of using a different method for collecting various items of data from the fire and rescue service.
> 
> (ix) _ **Lower cost domestic sprinkler (LCDS) systems - Evaluation of small scale pilot trials in Fire and Rescue Services (incorporating Version 10 of the draft DCLG Design Guide)** _. The aim of this report was to record the progress made by Fire and rescue Services in installing lower cost domestic sprinkler (LCDS) systems as described in Version 10 of the draft DCLG Design Guide.
> 
> (x) _ **The shape, form and function of operational guidance for the fire and rescue service** _. This report by Greenstreet Berman presented the findings of work carried out to determine the shape, form and function of future operational guidance. A human factors approach was applied to ensure that future operational guidance is: fit for purpose; presented in a style appropriate for the target audience and the context; appropriately organised; and easily accessible.
> 
> (xi) _ **Fire investigation reports workshop: Workshop summary report** _. Fire and rescue services undertake fire investigations and complete reports. Many of these reports contain valuable information which could be used nationally to inform practice and fire safety. This is a report of a workshop sponsored by DCLG and Chief Fire Officers Association (CFOA) to discuss how information from fire investigations could be better used and shared.
> 
> (xii) _ **The competencies and skills for incident command: An initial exploration** _. This report by the Health and Safety Laboratory was the first stage of a larger project to look at incident command in the fire and rescue service. The findings of this first stage provide an examination of the different psychological components of successful incident command as well as the identification of the competencies, skills and personal qualities and attributes required of an incident commander.
> 
> (xiii) _ **Comparison of European fire statistics** _. This report by Greenstreet Berman Ltd examined the statistics collected by European countries regarding the consequence and incidence of fire. Technical experts in 24 European states responded to an online questionnaire explaining how their country collects fire data. The contractors then contrast different approaches to fire data collection and make suggestions for which countries' data could be directly compared.
> 
> (xiv) _ **Developing a model to estimate the economic cost of Special Service Incidents in England** _. This report by Entec UK Ltd. investigated the possibility of assessing the costs associated with Special Service Incidents in England, with the primary focus being the costs to the Fire and Rescue Service.
> 
> (xv) _ **A review of the Fire Kills Fire Safety Education Prog** _ramme. This report by Greenstreet Berman Ltd. contains the results of a project to measure the level of awareness (amongst community fire safety staff) and use of the Fire Kills Fire Safety Education Programme packs within the Fire and Rescue Service. The report contains case studies providing information on the fire safety education carried out by six fire and rescue services and is based on surveys from 2007.
> 
> (xvi) _ **Collation and analysis of Fire and Rescue Service expenditure data** _. This report by Spikes Cavell and Co. provided an overview of the results of a project carried out to provide a better understanding of the size, structure and opportunities within the fire market. The report identified opportunities for collaboration and procurement efficiencies.

### Children and young people strategy

> (xvii) _ **Informing the development of the fire and rescue service strategy for working with children and young people: consulting with the youth sector** _. This report by the National Youth Agency provided the findings of a consultation with the youth sector about the draft children and young people strategy 2010-2013. The report is based on the findings from an online survey, a series of semi-structured interviews and a focus group with young people.
> 
> (xviii) _ **Evaluation of the children and young people Strategy: 2006-2010** _. This report by GfK NOP Social Research provided an understanding of the awareness and use of the 2006-2010 children and young people strategy, as well as suggestions of how the strategy could be improved in the future.

### Impact of modernisation on the fire and rescue service

> (xix) _ **The impact of modernisation on fire and rescue services** _. This report by Actica Consulting Ltd. assessed the impact of the portfolio of change projects initiated by DCLG on Fire and Rescue Services in England. Senior members of staff were interviewed and provided key documents on which the findings and recommendations were based.
> 
> (xx) _ **Project planning for fire and resilience directorate projects that impact fire and rescue services** _. This report by Actica Consulting Ltd. follows on from the previous report assessing the impact of modernisation on the fire and rescue service. It contains the findings and recommendations of a short study to identify options to co-ordinate demands on fire and rescue service demands.

These reports and findings are of general policy interest, but do not relate to forthcoming policy announcements and are not a reflection of the current Government's policies and priorities. DCLG is publishing these reports in the interests of transparency.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/fire/2188953,Legacy FiReControl buildings,"* * *

I want to update the House on my Department's progress with the Regional Control Centre buildings - the main legacy asset of the terminated FiReControl project from the last Administration.

The nine Regional Control Centre buildings were procured through a private developer scheme from 2004 onwards and completed between June 2007 and February 2010. The leases run for 20 or 25 years from completion. As noted on 26 January 2009, _Official Report_, House of Commons, Column 108W, the last Administration decided not to include break clauses in the contracts, forcing taxpayers to shoulder the ultimate liability for the empty buildings.

The National Audit Office, in their report _The Failure of Fire Control_, were highly critical of the top-down FiReControl project. They stated:

> ""The FiReControl project was flawed from the outset because it did not have the support of those essential to its success - local fire and rescue services. The Department rushed the start of the project, failing to follow proper procedures. Ineffective checks and balances during initiation and early stages meant the Department committed itself to the project on the basis of broad-brush and inaccurate estimates of costs and benefits and an unrealistic delivery timetable, and agreed an inadequate contract with its IT supplier. The Department under-appreciated the project's complexity, and then mismanaged the IT contractor's performance and delivery. The Department failed to provide the necessary leadership to make the project successful, over-relying on poorly managed consultants and failing to sort out early problems with delivery by the contractor. The Department took a firmer grip of the project from 2009 and terminated the contract in December 2010 to avoid even more money being wasted""  
(National Audit Office, _The Failure of the FiReControl project_, HC1272, 1 July 2011).

Following the termination of the FiReControl project in December 2010 by the Coalition Government, my Department explored whether fire and rescue authorities could make use of the centres as they were purpose built for control services. Our next preference was for other emergency services to take over the buildings. Our prime aims were to ensure value for taxpayers' money and achieve a localist approach to improvements in resilience.

I can report success for four of the buildings. One is already in use as a control centre and three further buildings will be used by emergency services, as follows:

  * The London building was officially opened on 1 February 2012 - in good time for the Olympic and Paralympic Games - and is fully operational as the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority's control centre.
  * As announced by the Minister for Shipping on 22 November 2011, _Official Report_, House of Commons, Column 163, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency will use the Fareham building as their Operations Centre.
  * The Warrington building will be used as a shared control service for four fire authorities (Greater Manchester, Cheshire, Lancashire and Cumbria).
  * County Durham and Darlington Fire and Rescue Authority will use the Durham building as their new headquarters and control room.

Having sought public sector tenants, my Department is launching a marketing campaign to attract tenants from a wider range of organisations for the remaining five buildings, including from the private sector. These buildings are located in Wolverhampton, Cambridge, Taunton, Wakefield and Castle Donington. They are built to a high specification and have a number of desirable features, including excellent resilience, good security and easy access to major road networks. Buyers of the control rooms will also benefit from the £6,000 a piece deluxe, polished chrome 'Brasilia' espresso machines that were purchased for each of the centres by the last Administration (as outlined on 15 March 2010, _Official Report_, House of Commons, Column 665W).

Marketing begins in late July, with sale boards going up at the five buildings. Other marketing activities will comprise some print and online advertising, a brochure for interested organisations, a dedicated website and site visits. My Department has looked for cost effective marketing channels, including no-cost and low-cost routes, and will keep the outcomes under review in order to assess effectiveness and progress.

In the meantime, we have taken firm steps to reduce the costs of the unused control centres. For example, the facilities management bill has been reduced by 25 per cent and the utilities bill by 35 per cent. A second review of the facilities management arrangements will result in a further reduction from April 2013. While we will continue to seek to drive down these costs to make savings for the taxpayer, the largest saving will come from finding suitable tenants to take over the buildings.

I want to inform the House of my Department's intention to provide an Authorised Guarantee Agreement to the landlord of the North West Regional Control Centre building. This statement sits alongside a departmental minute I have laid before the House setting out the contingent liability associated with the provision of an Authorised Guarantee Agreement.

As set out in the departmental minute, the lease for the North West Control Centre in Warrington has been assigned to NW Fire Control Ltd, a consortium of four fire and rescue authorities. The consortium will use the building to provide a shared control service. This is positive news, which will result in emergency calls being taken in a specialist, highly resilient, purpose-built centre. We are providing an Authorised Guarantee Agreement to the landlord, as provided for in the lease.

My Department and NW Fire Control Ltd have already entered into a formal agreement regarding the control centre building for the lifetime of the lease, which runs until 2033. As such, we expect there to be no costs to Government from the provision of this Authorised Guarantee Agreement.

It is clearly unsatisfactory that taxpayers have had to foot the bill for this poorly conceived and poorly implemented project from the last Administration, and taxpayers will no doubt resent such expensive buildings lying empty because of the botched procurement and handling of FireControl under the last Government. However, the Coalition Government has taken firm action to protect the public purse from the botched programme and sought to minimise the cost of these inherited liabilities, in as far as we are able to given the constraints of the contracts that were signed.

Ministers will continue to keep Parliament informed of progress.

On 9 February I reported to the House on the Heads of Agreement on the firefighters' pension scheme to be introduced in 2015, which set out the Government's final position on the main elements of scheme design. My officials have continued discussions with the firefighter unions and the Local Government Association over the remaining details of the firefighters' pension scheme.  
  
The Government pays tribute to the importance of the work undertaken by our fire and rescue service and the bravery, dedication and professionalism of the men and women who work within it. The Government is committed to providing public service pensions that are sustainable, fair and effective.  
  
Building on the proposals brought forward by Lord Hutton, the proposed final agreement aims to strike a balanced deal between public service workers and the taxpayer. They will ensure that public service workers continue to have access to good pensions, while taxpayers benefit from greater control over their costs.  
  
Public sector pensions will remain among the very best available - a guaranteed level and inflation proofed. Only 1 in 10 private sector workers have access to such schemes.

I can now report to the House that discussions on the design parameters for the firefighters' pension scheme in England to be introduced in 2015 have been concluded. This sets out our final position on proposed scheme design, which we are asking unions to take to their Executives as the outcome of negotiations.  
  
The headline elements of the proposed final agreement are set out below. The Government intends to maintain constructive dialogue with the fire fighter unions and the Local Government Association as detailed work goes forward.  
  
There will be full statutory protections provided in the new Scheme for the accrued rights of existing Scheme members:

  * all benefits accrued under final salary arrangements will be linked to the members' final salary, in accordance with the rules of the members' current schemes, when they leave the reformed scheme
  * full recognition of a member's expectation to double accrual for service accrued under the Firefighters' Pension Scheme 1992 ('the 1992 scheme'), so that a member's full continuous pensionable service upon retirement will be used to calculate an averaged accrual rate to be applied to service accrued under the 1992 scheme
  * members to be able to access their 1992 scheme benefits when they retire at that scheme's 'ordinary pension' age (i.e. from age 50 with 25 or more years pensionable service), subject to abatement rules for that scheme. Pensionable service for the purpose of calculating the ordinary pension age will include any continuous pensionable service accrued under both the 1992 scheme and the 2015 scheme
  * members of the 1992 scheme will continue to have access to an actuarially assessed commutation factor for benefits accrued under that scheme

There also will be transitional statutory protections for qualifying, existing members:

  * all active scheme members who, as of 1 April 2012, have 10 years or less to their current Normal Pension Age will see no change in when they can retire, nor any decrease in the amount of pension they receive at their current Normal Pension Age. This protection will be achieved by the member remaining in their current scheme until they retire, which could be beyond 31 March 2022.
  * there will be a further 4 years of tapered protection for scheme members. Members who are up to 14 years from their current Normal Pension Age, as of 1 April 2012, will have limited protection so that on average for every month of age they are beyond 10 years of their Normal Pension Age, they gain about 53 days of protection. The last day of protected service for any member will be 31 March 2022.

The core parameters of the new Scheme are set out below:

> a. a pension scheme design based on career average revalued earnings
> 
> b. an accrual rate of 1/58.7th of pensionable earnings each year
> 
> c. there will be no cap on how much pension can be accrued
> 
> d. a revaluation rate of active members' benefits in line with average weekly earnings
> 
> e. pensions in payment and deferred benefits to increase in line with Prices Index (currently CPI)
> 
> f. Member contribution rates in the 2015 scheme from 1 April 2015 will average 13.2 per cent, equal to the expected average of contribution rates in the 1992 and 2006 schemes on the 31 March 2015. However, as announced by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury on 20 December 2011, the Government will review the impact of the proposed 2012-13 contribution changes, including the effect of membership opt-outs, before taking final decisions on how future increases will be delivered in 2013-14 and 2014-15, and in the new scheme. Interested parties will have a full opportunity to provide evidence and their views to the Government as part of the review
> 
> g. without prejudice to the outcome of that review, tariffs for the 2015 scheme are likely to provide for lower rates for new recruits, with some tiered progressive increases for middle, high, and higher income earners
> 
> h. flexible retirement from the scheme's minimum pension age of 55, built around the scheme's Normal Pension Age of 60, with members able to take their pension from the scheme's minimum pension age, as follows:
> 
> - for all active members who are aged 57 or more at retirement, 2015 scheme benefits taken before Normal Pension Age will be actuarially reduced with reference to the 2015 scheme's Normal Pension Age, rather than the deferred pension age  
- all other members will have their 2015 scheme benefits actuarially reduced on a cost neutral basis from the scheme's deferred pension age.
> 
> i. authority initiated early retirement for members of the 2015 scheme, from age 55, to be in accordance with the arrangements set out in Part 3, Rule 6 of the New Firefighters' Pension Scheme 2006
> 
> j. the Normal Pension Age will be subject to regular review. These reviews will consider the increasing State Pension Age and any changes to it, alongside evidence from interested parties, including unions and employers. It will consider if the Normal Pension Age of 60 remains relevant, taking account of the economical, efficient and effective management of the fire service, the changing profile of the workforce and the occupational demands of, and fitness standards for, firefighting roles
> 
> k. this regular review will be informed by research to be carried out, within the auspices of the Firefighters' Pension Committee, which will monitor and collate scheme data and experience
> 
> l. late retirement factors for members retiring from active service to be actuarially neutral from Normal Pension Age
> 
> m. a deferred pension age equal to the individuals' State Pension Age
> 
> n. an optional lump sum by commutation at a rate of £12 for every £1 per annum of pension foregone in accordance with HM Revenue and Customs limits and regulations
> 
> o. abatement in existing schemes to continue
> 
> p. ill-health retirement benefits to be based on the arrangements in the 2006 scheme
> 
> q. all other ancillary benefits to be based on those contained in the 2006 scheme
> 
> r. members rejoining after a period of deferment of less than 5 years can link new service with previous service, as if they had always been an active member
> 
> s. members transferring between public service schemes would be treated as having continuous active service
> 
> t. an employer contribution cap with a symmetrical buffer.

The scheme actuary has confirmed that this scheme design does not exceed the cost ceiling set by the Government on 2 November. Copies of the proposed final agreement and scheme actuary verification have been deposited in the Libraries of both Houses.

I would like to update Hon. Members on changes to the publication of the Department's statistics.

Today my Department has announced its response to the consultation on proposed changes to the Department's statistics. From October this year, we will no longer publish statistics at a government office regional level. Instead the Department will plan to publish, where appropriate, statistics for Local Enterprise Partnerships and upper-tier local authorities, complementing existing statistics by local authority.

The Coalition Government has abolished regional government. The unelected Regional Assemblies/Regional Chambers, the Government Offices for the Regions, the Regional FiReControl programme, the Regional Development Agencies have been terminated, as is intended for the Regional Spatial Strategies, subject to the strategic environment assessment process outlined in my statement of 3 September 2012, _Official Report, Column 5WS_.

The government office regions were an inefficient tier of administration based on arbitrary boundaries. They did not reflect the areas that local residents most identified with, nor were they areas with common economic problems and market conditions, nor were they the most sensible boundaries for coordinating functions such as fire and resilience.

The continuing use of the former government office regional boundaries no longer provides a coherent framework for assessing public policy. Many of the Government's policies now use alternative local geographies, for example Local Enterprise Partnerships, the New Homes Bonus and City Deals. Publishing statistics at a regional level is no longer necessary or informative, and we see little point in producing statistics at taxpayers' expense for their own sake.

The old regional classifications are also misleading - they fail to quantify both the pockets of deprivation that can exist within regions or the differences between rural and urban England, and there is an inconsistency of approach to the size and population of each government region. They are arbitrary lines on a map that have no resonance - in contrast to England's long-standing cities, boroughs and counties which have a real sense of local identity and popular support, dating back centuries in many cases. England has no history of regional government, whereas it does have a great tradition of local governance that this Government wishes to strengthen.

There is also a European dimension to the regions in the form of Eurostat's Nomenclature of Units for Territorial Statistics standard (the appropriately named 'NUTS Regulations'). It is the view of Ministers that the NUTS1 hierarchy is no longer appropriate for Structural Funds in England moving forward from 2014. Ministers reject the notion of a 'Europe of the Regions' where nation-states and national Parliaments are sidelined, and replaced with distant regional governments answerable only to a federal European super-state. Dismantling such arbitrary, unelected regional administrative structures will assist in that goal.

Ministers have carefully considered all the representations made in the consultation. I would note that, for the purposes of historic comparisons, nothing prevents academics and other interested parties from compiling and analysing the open local authority data by the old regional government boundaries, if they wish.

The consultation response also notes the implementation of a new form on local authority housing statistics which reduces and rationalises the data we are asking local authorities to provide, reducing burdens on local government. It also reports on the responses on Land Use Change Statistics which confirmed their importance for monitoring the outcomes of planning policy.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/housing/2212914,Housing and growth,"* * *

_Draft text of the statement - may differ from the delivered version._

With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a statement on housing and planning.

  * The Coalition Government inherited a legacy where house building had fallen to its lowest rates since the 1920s.
  * A top-down planning system that built nothing but resentment.
  * A regime of regional planning quangos that created paralysis and confrontation. After six years of preparation, by the general election, less than 60 councils had completed local plans.

The result was no development. No regeneration. No community benefits.

This Government wants to get the economy growing.

To remove unnecessary red tape.

To support locally-led sustainable development.

In November, the Government published a comprehensive [housing strategy](http://www.communities.gov.uk/housing/about/keymeasures/) to support a thriving, active and stable housing market.

In March, we published a [National Planning Policy Framework](http://www.communities.gov.uk/planningandbuilding/planningsystem/planningpolicy/planningpolicyframework/) to condense 1,000 pages of central planning guidance to just 50.

Housebuilding is up - 29 per cent higher in 2011 than in 2009. But there is more to do.

So today, my Department is announcing a further series of common sense measures to promote house building and support locally-led economic growth.

The technical details are laid out in a [Written Statement](http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/newsroom/2211838) which has been laid before the House. I will summarise the key points for Hon Members.

  * Following on from [Sir Adrian Montague's independent report](http://www.communities.gov.uk/housing/privaterentedhousing/investment/) on supporting the private rented sector, we are providing £200 million of new funding to support institutional investment in high-quality rented homes.
  * Thanks to the action we have taken to tackle the last Government's deficit, we are passing on the lower costs of borrowing. We will be issuing a debt guarantee for up to £10 billion to support private investment in the private rented sector and in new affordable housing.
  * We will support up to an additional 15,000 affordable homes through the use of loan guarantees, flexibilities and capital funding.
  * We also intend to extend our successful refurbishment programme to bring an additional 5,000 existing empty homes back into use. The last Government wanted to demolish Victorian terraces with John Prescott's Pathfinder programme. By contrast, we are getting homes back into productive use.
  * In total we will invest another £300m in these measures to support new affordable homes and bring empty homes into use.
  * We actively want to support home ownership, which fell under the last Parliament despite a Labour pledge to increase it by a million.  
We are extending our successful FirstBuy scheme for first time buyers, with an additional £280 million of funding, helping up to 16,500 additional first time buyers to purchase a home.
  * To free up more brownfield land for development and regeneration, we will accelerate the release of surplus public sector land and empty offices through a targeted programme of transfers from other Government bodies.
  * We will work with local authorities and developers to unlock locally-supported large sites. Just last week, we were back to unblock the Eastern Quarry in the Ebbsfleet Valley - a major ex-industrial sitethat had stalled for a decade.

We are working with local communities and councils. But some councils need to raise their game, by failing to make planning decisions in a timely way. Planning delays create uncertainty both for local residents and local firms. So we will introduce a series of practical measures to help speed up planning decisions and appeals, and major infrastructure.

Some complex developments take time to assemble. So we are allowing for developers to extend the duration of existing planning permissions.

We are making it easier for developers to change unrealistic Section 106 agreements. A development which isn't built means no Section 106 payments. Common sense reforms will result in more regeneration, more housing and more community benefits.

Sustainable development should go hand in hand with environmental safeguards.

I can confirm that we have protected the Green Belt, in line with our commitment in the Coalition Agreement.

It has always the case that councils can amend local Green Belt boundaries should they wish - and we will support councils which choose to. This can include introducing new Green Belt protection around new large developments.

There is considerable previously developed land in many Green Belt areas. We encourage councils to make best use of this land, whilst protecting the openness of the Green Belt in line with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework.

If we are to protect our countryside, we need to focus more growth in our town centres. So we are introducing measures to make it easier to turn empty commercial buildings into housing. Our high streets will benefit from a greater resident population, increasing footfall and supporting local shops.

As a nation, we have great pride in our homes. We want to make it easier for families to undertake home improvements - such as building a new conservatory. So we will be seeking to simplify and increase permitted development rights for householders. Cutting back municipal red tape in this way could provide a particular boost for small traders and small builders.

Mr Speaker, These practical measures build on the housing, local government finance and planning reforms already in play.

Giving more power to individuals, to communities, to councils.

Providing new incentives to support local shops, local firms and local economic growth.

Delivering sustainable development and getting Britain building.

I commend this statement to the House.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/housing/2180566,"Unpublished research reports: Building, planning and the environment","* * *

Today the Government is publishing a group of reports presenting the findings from research projects commissioned by the previous administration.

We are publishing these documents in the interests of transparency and as part of our Freedom of Information commitment to publish the results of all commissioned research. For transparency, all completed work is being published regardless of format or robustness.

The [seven reports](http://www.communities.gov.uk/archived/general-content/corporate/researcharchive/volume12building/) published today represent the findings from seven research projects at a total cost of £190,320. These findings cover the topics of building, planning and the environment.

This research provides an improved evidence base to understand the costs, benefits and practical implications of applying the Lifetime Home Standard to new build housing development. In particular it develops cost analysis which more accurately reflects the likely contribution of access standards to the cumulative impact of regulation on housing supply, and sets out clearly the likely impact on different housing typologies, and on site density.

Although these reports are from the last Administration, they do touch upon current government policy. The Coalition Government has set out in the National Planning Policy Framework that Local Plans must take into account the housing needs of a range of users including older and disabled people. In November's Housing Strategy, this Government also set out its expectation that new development should have a diverse mix of property types, including more accessible designs such as the Lifetime Home Standard. However, we do not intend to introduce national regulation. We believe that decisions should be made at a local level, in proportion to local need and aligned with other local housing support and information services.

### Lifetime Homes Standards

> (i) ** _Modelling the current and potential accessibility of the housing stock_ ** - This report by Building Research Establishment considers the accessibility of the existing housing stock in England with particular reference to its utility for older and disabled people. The report uses data from the English Home Condition Survey to identify the frequency and suitability of a range of built features within homes to arrive at an overall assessment of their accessibility and future adaptability. The report was commissioned in 2006 at a cost of £56,305.
> 
> (ii) _ **Assessing the cost of Lifetime Homes Standards** _ - This report by the Building Cost Information Service (BCIS) looks at establishing the cost impact of introducing the Lifetime Homes Standards in private sector housing, identifying best practice and the potential cost savings that can be delivered through efficiency of design. The report was commissioned in 2009 at a cost of £34,818.
> 
> (iii) ** _Health benefits of Lifetime Home Standards_ ** - This report by the Building Research Establishment sets out findings from work to determine the relative benefits of building to the Lifetime Home Standard. Utilising existing data from the Housing Health and Safety Rating System, the research evaluated the health costs associated with the different levels of harm relating either to direct NHS costs or to societal costs. The report was commissioned in 2009 at a cost of £21,302.
> 
> (iv) ** _Lifetime Homes: Technical forum_ ** - This report by Habinteg Housing Association captures discussions and recommendations which emerged from a Technical Working Group established to test proposals for improving guidance in the Lifetime Home Standard. This report was commissioned in 2009 at a cost of £17,448.
> 
> (v) ** _Analysis of distribution of housing typologies in Public and Private Sector and typical compatibility with the Lifetime Home Standard_ ** - This research conducted by Levitt Bernstein considers the impact of and current compliance with the 16 point standard of _Lifetime Homes Lifetime Neighbourhoods - a National strategy for Housing in an Ageing Society_. Mindful that the standards were originally developed with very suburban 2, 3 and 4 bed detached housing in mind, there was a need to review the 16 point standard and consider the implications of applying it to current and emerging new build housing typologies in England and Wales. The research develops and agrees a model of the variety and distribution of future housing typologies in England and Wales and analyses what impact the application of Lifetime Homes Standards will have on varying house typologies. The study focussed primarily on private sector housing. This report was commissioned in 2009 at a cost of £34,360.
> 
> (vi) ** _Impact on site density of Lifetime Homes_ ** - This research work conducted by Levitt Bernstein is an extension to an earlier piece of work and represents an initial exploration of the impact that the application of Lifetime Homes Standards is likely to have on the site density of private sector housing. It concentrates on low to medium density suburban developments, typically 30-60 dwellings per hectare (dph). The research consisted of a theoretical analysis to calculate the effect on plot size of various increases to plan footprints; an assessment of impact on density on a small sample of typical site layouts in addition to feed back from industry about site density and marketability. This report was commissioned in 2009 at a cost of £16,087.
> 
> (vii) _ **Design of Lifetime homes** _ - This research conducted by Hunt Thomson Architects seeks to evaluate the impact on designing private sectors homes to meet the Lifetime Home Standard, and in particular to understand the likely impact of seeking to minimise both increase in cost and any necessary increase in the overall size of properties by adopting the standard. The project utilised analysis of a range of typical speculative housing development plans and compares these designs with entirely new housing layouts which incorporate the 16 elements of the Lifetime Home Standard. This report was commissioned in 2009 at a cost of £10,000.

At a time when public budgets must be reduced, the new Government wants to ensure its research delivers best possible value for money for the taxpayer and that sums expended are reasonable in relation to the public policy benefits obtained. My department has put in place new scrutiny and challenge processes for future research.

Any new projects will be scrutinised to ensure the methodology is sound and that all options for funding are explored at an early stage. This includes using existing work from other organisations, joint funding projects with other departments or organisations and taking work forward in-house.

Copies of these reports are available on the Department for Communities and Local Government [website](http://www.communities.gov.uk/archived/general-content/corporate/researcharchive/volume12building/). Copies have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/housing/2211838,Housing and growth,"* * *

The Coalition Government's number one priority is to get the economy growing. We must create the conditions that support local economic growth and remove barriers that stop local businesses creating jobs and getting Britain building again.

In November, the Government published a comprehensive housing strategy and we have rapidly put in place measures set out in the strategy to support a thriving, active and stable housing market.

We are reforming the Right to Buy by significantly increasing the discounts available to tenants to buy their own home. We launched our NewBuy scheme allowing people access to mortgages with only a 5 per cent deposit. And to unblock stalled sites with the capacity for up to 16,000 homes we launched the £570 million Get Britain Building fund. We also announced plans to dispose of public sector land with the capacity to deliver 100,000 homes, and invested £770 million in infrastructure for housing and growth through the Growing Places Fund.

House building starts across England were 29 per cent higher in 2011 compared to 2009. But there is far more to do to provide homes to meet Britain's demographic needs and to help generate local economic growth.

### Increasing investment in the private rented sector

The rented sector already provides good quality homes for many young people, professionals and families. But growth has been constrained by the lack of large scale investment. We invited Sir Adrian Montague to report on the barriers to institutional investment and intend to take up Sir Adrian's key recommendation. Today I can announce that we will be investing £200 million in housing sites to ensure that the high-quality rented homes that are needed are available to institutional investors quickly. And we will be establishing a taskforce to bring together developers, management bodies and institutional investors to broker deals and deliver more rented homes.

The Government will also use its hard earned fiscal credibility to pass on lower costs of borrowing to support the long-term delivery of new rental homes. To give institutional investors the assurance they need to invest in this area we will be issuing a debt guarantee for up to £10 billion for this scheme and the affordable housing scheme set out below. Under the scheme, the Government will enable providers to raise debt with a Government guarantee, where they commit to investing in additional new-build rented homes. From tomorrow, the Government will be inviting expressions of interest from companies wishing to benefit from the scheme. It is expected that housing associations, property management companies and developers will be amongst those to benefit.

### Affordable Housing Guarantees and tackling empty homes

The need for affordable housing remains high. We will therefore be extending the use of guarantees to cover borrowing needed to deliver more affordable homes. Building on the success of the Affordable Homes Programme, the Government will invite bids to provide up to an additional 15,000 affordable homes through the use of loan guarantees, asset management flexibilities and capital funding. We also intend to extend our successful refurbishment programme to bring an additional 5,000 existing empty homes back into use. In total we will invest another £300 million.

### Helping first time buyers

To complement supporting the rented sector, we also want to help those who want to get onto and move up the housing ladder.

Building on our existing schemes, we will continue to support house building and to help people into home ownership through Newbuy - making it easier to access a mortgage with only a 5 per cent deposit. We are working with the Home Builders Federation and the Council of Mortgage Lenders to increase take up and grow the number of builders and lenders in the scheme. I welcome Monday's announcement that Aldermore, have joined the scheme - taking the number of lenders up to six, over 70 per cent of the market. Homebuilders and lenders will work together on a concerted marketing campaign over the Autumn to raise consumer awareness and understanding of scheme.

We will also allocate an additional £280 million, with a matching contribution from house builders, to extend our very successful FirstBuy scheme to March 2014. This will allow up to 16,500 additional first time buyers to purchase a home.

### Accelerating large housing schemes

The need for new homes is acute, and supply remains constrained. There are many large housing schemes in areas of high housing demand that could provide real benefit to local communities once delivered. But, large schemes are complicated and raise a wide range of complex issues that can be difficult to resolve.

Building on success in working with Kent local authorities and developers to unlock major housing opportunities at Eastern Quarry in the Ebbsfleet Valley, the Government will work in partnership with local authorities, scheme promoters and communities to accelerate delivery of locally-supported, major housing sites. These will be sites where there is local support for growth, strong demand for new homes, and good prospects for early delivery.

Off-site construction can create skilled jobs, improve the quality of homes and ultimately bring down costs. An industry-led group convened by DCLG and BIS, will look in detail at the barriers holding back the growth of this part of the sector and how increased use of such techniques can be incentivised. We will ask this advisory group of experts to prepare an proposals by Budget 2013, with the aim of improving the efficiency of housing supply and unlocking high value jobs in the UK.

Thanks to the Government's credible fiscal strategy, homeowners are benefiting from historically low interest rates. However, the private sector needs to be able to access both finance and land to build the homes we need. The Funding for Lending Scheme, run by the Bank of England with the approval of the Government, provides strong incentives for banks and building societies to boost lending, including mortgages and loans to businesses

### Getting surplus public sector land back into use

In response to emerging conclusions from a review chaired by Tony Pidgley, Chairman of the Berkeley Group, the Government will accelerate the release of surplus public sector land by strengthening the role of Homes and Communities Agency outside London through a targeted programme of transfers from other Government Departments and agencies. We will also work to accelerate disposals by preparing the land for market and providing a single 'shop window' for all surplus public sector land. We will work with the Mayor of London with a view to developing a similar approach in London, and to resolve how other measures are delivered for the benefit of Londoners.

### Reducing planning delays

To get more homes built - and more workshops, factories and offices - we need a planning system which works proactively to support the growth that this country needs.

The National Planning Policy Framework is a major step forward. It has been widely welcomed by business, and as a result of its positive influence we are already seeing accelerated plan-making and more positive decision-taking.

We are clear that local people - and local authorities - must be at the heart of planning. The last government tried top-down imposition of growth and unequivocally failed. The imposition of Regional Strategies built nothing but resentment, with house building falling to its lowest peacetime rate since the 1920s.

The Localism Act has put the power to plan back in the hands of communities, but with this power comes responsibility: a responsibility to meet their needs for development and growth, and to deal quickly and effectively with proposals that will deliver homes, jobs and facilities.

Today we are announcing a series of additional measures to drive the effective implementation of these reforms and remove unnecessary bureaucracy that can hinder sustainable growth.

Given the importance of efficient and effective planning decisions for the economy, we need to ensure that where there are clear failures in performance, that applicants are able to access a better service. We propose to legislate to allow applications to be decided by the Planning Inspectorate, if the local authority has a track record of consistently poor performance in the speed or quality of its decisions. Planning is a quasi-judicial process: justice delayed is justice denied. It is unfair to all parties for local planning authorities simply to fail to make timely decisions on a planning application - creating uncertainty both for applicants and local residents.

In support of this we will also require more transparent reporting of council performance on planning, and will be working with the Local Government Association to increase the use of Planning Performance Agreements for major schemes - which commit both applicants and planning authorities to a clear timetable for determining proposals. In addition, we intend to give Planning Inspectors more power to initiate an award of costs in planning appeal proceedings, where it is clear that an application has not been handled as it should have been with due process.

Swift determination of appeals by the Planning Inspectorate is also of critical importance. We will consult shortly on options to speed up planning appeals - and for a new fast-track procedure for some small commercial appeals. I have also instructed the Planning Inspectorate with immediate effect to divert resources to prioritise all major economic and housing related appeals, to ensure applicants receive a response in the quickest possible time.

I have also extended a measure that allows developers the chance to seek additional time to get their sites up and running before planning permission expires, for an additional year. This measure will cut the costs of getting developments back on track.

Getting the infrastructure projects that the country's economic success relies upon underway as swiftly as possible is also a top priority. The planning regime for Major Infrastructure which deals with many of these cases is bedding in well and is bringing benefits through its streamlined and more certain processes. We want to ensure that this planning regime rightly focuses on the most important schemes whilst also extending the benefits of it to other forms of development which are of national importance.

To achieve this we now intend to review the thresholds for some of the existing categories in the regime, and also to bring new categories of commercial and business development into the regime - making it possible for such schemes, where they are of sufficient significance, to be considered and determined at a national level. We will also work to extend the principle of a one-stop-shop for non-planning consents for major infrastructure, and amend the Special Parliamentary procedures which apply to major infrastructure to ensure they are fit for purpose.

### Reducing the cumulative burden of red tape

It is vital that the affordable housing element of Section 106 agreements negotiated during different economic conditions is not allowed to undermine the viability of sites and prevent any construction of new housing. This results in no development, no regeneration and no community benefits at all when agreements are no longer economically viable.

The Government estimates that up to 75,000 new homes are currently stalled due to site viability. S106 is an important tool to provide affordable housing and we welcome the flexible approach that many councils have already taken to renegotiating these agreements where necessary. The Government is also acting to get developers and councils around the table through its new mediation scheme. However, given the current imperative for growth, we need to do more.

The Government will now introduce legislation, to be effective in early 2013, which will allow any developer of sites which are unviable because of the number of affordable homes, to appeal with immediate effect. The Planning Inspectorate will be instructed to assess how many affordable homes would need to be removed from the Section 106 agreement for the site to be viable in current economic conditions. The Planning Inspectorate would then, as necessary, set aside the existing Section 106 agreement for a three year period, in favour of a new agreement with fewer affordable homes. We would encourage councils to take the opportunity before legislation comes into effect to seek negotiated solutions where possible.

Alongside this, the Government is also consulting on legislation that would allow developers to renegotiate non-viable Section 106 agreements entered into prior to April 2010.  
   
There is concern that the array of local and national standards used in different parts the country is complex and counter-productive: confusing local residents, councillors and developers. I am announcing today a fundamental and urgent review led by Government working with interested parties to rationalise these standards. This review will result in a clear plan of action by next spring, including legislative approaches if a significant rationalisation cannot be agreed.

### Supporting locally-led development

We have previously made clear the importance we attach to delivering new large-scale settlements. The recovery criteria already includes large residential developments. To align this with the call-in process, I will also carefully consider the use of call-in for major new settlements with larger than local impacts.

To support locally-led development, communities will share in benefits including the New Homes Bonus, Community Infrastructure Levy contributions towards local infrastructure, and the financial benefits of business rates discounts and forthcoming business rates retention from April 2013.

The Green Belt is an important protection against urban sprawl, providing a 'green lung' around towns and cities. The Coalition Agreement commits the Government to safeguarding Green Belt and other environmental designations, which they have been in the new National Planning Policy Framework. The Localism Act allows for the abolition of Labour's Regional Spatial Strategies which sought to bulldoze the Green Belt around thirty towns and cities across the country, subject to the Strategic Environmental Assessment process, as outlined in my Statement of 3 September 2012, Official Report, Column 5WS.

As has always been the case, councils can review local designations to promote growth. We encourage councils to use the flexibilities set out in the National Planning Policy Framework to tailor the extent of Green Belt land in their areas to reflect local circumstances. Where Green Belt is considered in reviewing or drawing up Local Plans, we will support councils to move quickly through the process by prioritising their Local Plan examinations... There is considerable previously developed land in many Green Belt areas, which could be put to more productive use. We encourage Councils to make best use of this land, whilst protecting the openness of the Green Belt in line with the requirements in the National Planning Policy Framework.

### Helping homeowners improve their homes

As a nation, we have great pride in our homes, and I want to make it easier for families to undertake home improvements: not just to cut red tape and strengthen individual homeowners' rights, but also to help generate economic activity which will support small traders in particular.

I am announcing today a further package of simplification measures to remove red tape and ease the burden on local authorities. We will consult shortly on changes to increase existing permitted development rights for extensions to homes and business premises in non protected areas for a three-year period. This will mean less municipal red tape to build a conservatory and similar small-scale home improvement and free up valuable resources in local authorities.

### Getting empty offices into use

We have already undertaken a series of measures to make change of use easier, to help get empty buildings back into productive use.

We will introduce permitted development rights to enable change of use from commercial to residential purposes, while providing the opportunity for authorities to seek a local exemption where they believe there will be an adverse economic impact. This common sense measure will help the regeneration of our towns and cities. Our high streets will benefit from a greater resident population, increasing footfall and supporting local shops.

This package of measures will ensure that the reforms which we have made to the planning system are implemented as effectively as possible, and that the planning system plays as full a role as possible in supporting local jobs and local firms.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/localgovernment/2236815,Localising council tax support,"* * *

In the 2010 Spending Review, the Government announced plans to localise council tax benefit and this is being taken forward through the Local Government Finance Bill currently before Parliament. From April 2013, these reforms will localise council tax support and give councils stronger incentives to support local firms, cut fraud, promote local enterprise and get people back into work.

These reforms contribute to the Government's deficit reduction programme, delivering savings of £470million a year of taxpayers' money in Great Britain from 2013-14. Welfare reform is vital to tackle the budget deficit, as council tax benefit expenditure in England increased from £2.0billion to £4.3billion from 1997-98 by 2010-11.

Localisation will give local authorities the flexibility to design council tax support schemes for working age claimants in their area. We have been clear that councils have the scope to help manage the impact of the reduction in council tax support funding through securing sensible savings. To help the transition to these changes, my Department has already provided £30million of funding to help councils draw up local support schemes.

There is a real incentive for councils to make savings in the new localised system from cutting fraud and error, where an estimated £200 million was paid out unnecessarily in 2011-12. However, we appreciate that these savings may not be delivered immediately in the first year.

Consequently, to further assist the transition process, my Department is today announcing an additional £100million of funding for councils to help support them in developing well-designed council tax support schemes and maintain positive incentives to work. This is new and additional funding for local government.

As councils draw up their local schemes, it is clear that many are delivering savings using their local flexibilities and discretion, without unfairly increasing the burden on those who are currently on benefits. Equally, there are some councils which are asking for very large additional contributions from those on benefits.

The new £100million transition grant will seek to encourage best practice. The voluntary grant will be available to councils (billing and major precepting authorities) who choose to design their local schemes so that:

  * those who would be on 100 per cent support under current council tax benefit arrangements pay between zero and no more than 8.5 per cent of their council tax liability;
  * the taper rate does not increase above 25 per cent;
  * there is no sharp reduction in support for those entering work - for claimants currently entitled to less than 100 per cent support, the taper will be applied to an amount at least equal to their maximum eligible award.

In allowing flexibility over aspects of the scheme, we would not expect local authorities to impose large additional increases in non-dependant deductions. Councils will rightly want to avoid collecting small payments, and it may consequently be better value for money for councils to avoid designing schemes which seek to do so.

The amount of funding for which councils will be eligible to apply and the timescales and process for making an application will be published shortly. We anticipate that councils will make applications after 31 January 2013, and that funding will be paid in March 2013. The grant will be a simple one, easy to apply for and swiftly paid out, to help those councils who choose to do the right thing.

The Government has a clear goal in tackling the deficit, and reducing spending on benefits. This measured, transitional approach will help deliver an important programme of welfare reform, whilst still protecting taxpayers' broader interests.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/localgovernment/2239809,Business Rates,"* * *

I am today announcing the Government's intention to postpone the next business rates revaluation in England to 2017. Primary legislation will be brought forward through the Growth and Infrastructure Bill which will shortly be laid before Parliament.

Business rates are the third biggest outgoing for local firms after rent and staff costs. This decision will avoid local firms and local shops facing unexpected hikes in their business rate bills over the next five years. As business rates are linked to inflation, there will be no real terms increase in rates over this period. This reform will provide certainty for business to plan and invest, supporting local economic growth.

Since the last revaluation (based on 2008 valuations), the economy and property market have faced exceptional changes. A revaluation at this point would be likely to result in sharp changes to business rate bills in many parts of the country and in many sectors. Tax stability is vital to businesses looking to grow and help improve the economy.

The Government is committed to maintaining up to date rate bills through regular five yearly revaluations in England which will resume after 2017, once the economy has had a chance to recover fully from the financial and fiscal crisis this Government inherited from the last Administration.

These measures complement the local retention of business rates being introduced through the Local Government Finance Bill which will give councils new incentives to support local firms and local shops, and also complements the new power to introduce local business rate discounts, the automation of small business rate relief and the abolition of the unfair 'ports tax' all enacted through the Localism Act 2011.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/localgovernment/lepfunding,Core funding for Local Enterprise Partnerships,"* * *

BIS Minister of State for Business and Enterprise (Michael Fallon) and the DCLG Minister of State for Housing (Mark Prisk) are today announcing that £25m of Government funding will be made available to support local enterprise partnerships in their pursuit of economic growth.

Government's goal is to promote strong, sustainable and balanced growth across the UK. Local enterprise partnerships are central to our approach to driving local economic growth and for ensuring that every locality is able to fulfil its potential. Local enterprise partnerships are voluntary partnerships of business and civic leaders, working across local economic areas, and have a vitally important role in identifying opportunities for private sector growth and addressing local barriers to growth through the united efforts of their partners.

Local enterprise partnerships have also been encouraged to identify local barriers to growth where government action can address some of the specific barriers. Ministers across government are committed to supporting local enterprise partnerships achieve their local growth priorities and tackle the barriers to progress.

In response to recent strong representations BIS and DCLG have decided to offer jointly up to £250k pa of matched core funding to local enterprise partnerships for the remainder of this Parliament (until 2014/15), subject to satisfactory proposals being received. We will offer each local enterprise partnership a one-off initial payment of £125k for the remainder of this financial year to provide immediate support, with subsequent years funding dependent on matched funding from local partners. Where matched by funds locally the overall funding pot could equate up to £45m over this period. With this offer of core resources, local enterprise partnerships will be asked to ensure that they have a clear set of priorities for local growth in place.

Local enterprise partnerships will remain voluntary business and civic partnerships to drive sustainable private sector growth and job creation in their area. This offer of core resource funding will provide more capacity for local enterprise partnerships to drive forward their growth priorities, allow them to do longer term resource planning and strengthen support and autonomy of the business-led boards.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/localgovernment/localstatistics,Local statistics,"* * *

I would like to update Hon. Members on changes to the publication of the Department's statistics.

Today my Department has announced its response to the consultation on proposed changes to the Department's statistics. From October this year, we will no longer publish statistics at a government office regional level. Instead the Department will plan to publish, where appropriate, statistics for Local Enterprise Partnerships and upper-tier local authorities, complementing existing statistics by local authority.

The Coalition Government has abolished regional government. The unelected Regional Assemblies/Regional Chambers, the Government Offices for the Regions, the Regional FiReControl programme, the Regional Development Agencies have been terminated, as is intended for the Regional Spatial Strategies, subject to the strategic environment assessment process outlined in my statement of 3 September 2012, _Official Report, Column 5WS_.

The government office regions were an inefficient tier of administration based on arbitrary boundaries. They did not reflect the areas that local residents most identified with, nor were they areas with common economic problems and market conditions, nor were they the most sensible boundaries for coordinating functions such as fire and resilience.

The continuing use of the former government office regional boundaries no longer provides a coherent framework for assessing public policy. Many of the Government's policies now use alternative local geographies, for example Local Enterprise Partnerships, the New Homes Bonus and City Deals. Publishing statistics at a regional level is no longer necessary or informative, and we see little point in producing statistics at taxpayers' expense for their own sake.

The old regional classifications are also misleading - they fail to quantify both the pockets of deprivation that can exist within regions or the differences between rural and urban England, and there is an inconsistency of approach to the size and population of each government region. They are arbitrary lines on a map that have no resonance - in contrast to England's long-standing cities, boroughs and counties which have a real sense of local identity and popular support, dating back centuries in many cases. England has no history of regional government, whereas it does have a great tradition of local governance that this Government wishes to strengthen.

There is also a European dimension to the regions in the form of Eurostat's Nomenclature of Units for Territorial Statistics standard (the appropriately named 'NUTS Regulations'). It is the view of Ministers that the NUTS1 hierarchy is no longer appropriate for Structural Funds in England moving forward from 2014. Ministers reject the notion of a 'Europe of the Regions' where nation-states and national Parliaments are sidelined, and replaced with distant regional governments answerable only to a federal European super-state. Dismantling such arbitrary, unelected regional administrative structures will assist in that goal.

Ministers have carefully considered all the representations made in the consultation. I would note that, for the purposes of historic comparisons, nothing prevents academics and other interested parties from compiling and analysing the open local authority data by the old regional government boundaries, if they wish.

The consultation response also notes the implementation of a new form on local authority housing statistics which reduces and rationalises the data we are asking local authorities to provide, reducing burdens on local government. It also reports on the responses on Land Use Change Statistics which confirmed their importance for monitoring the outcomes of planning policy.

_Draft text of the statement - may differ from the delivered version._

With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a statement on housing and planning.

  * The Coalition Government inherited a legacy where house building had fallen to its lowest rates since the 1920s.
  * A top-down planning system that built nothing but resentment.
  * A regime of regional planning quangos that created paralysis and confrontation. After six years of preparation, by the general election, less than 60 councils had completed local plans.

The result was no development. No regeneration. No community benefits.

This Government wants to get the economy growing.

To remove unnecessary red tape.

To support locally-led sustainable development.

In November, the Government published a comprehensive [housing strategy](http://www.communities.gov.uk/housing/about/keymeasures/) to support a thriving, active and stable housing market.

In March, we published a [National Planning Policy Framework](http://www.communities.gov.uk/planningandbuilding/planningsystem/planningpolicy/planningpolicyframework/) to condense 1,000 pages of central planning guidance to just 50.

Housebuilding is up - 29 per cent higher in 2011 than in 2009. But there is more to do.

So today, my Department is announcing a further series of common sense measures to promote house building and support locally-led economic growth.

The technical details are laid out in a [Written Statement](http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/newsroom/2211838) which has been laid before the House. I will summarise the key points for Hon Members.

  * Following on from [Sir Adrian Montague's independent report](http://www.communities.gov.uk/housing/privaterentedhousing/investment/) on supporting the private rented sector, we are providing £200 million of new funding to support institutional investment in high-quality rented homes.
  * Thanks to the action we have taken to tackle the last Government's deficit, we are passing on the lower costs of borrowing. We will be issuing a debt guarantee for up to £10 billion to support private investment in the private rented sector and in new affordable housing.
  * We will support up to an additional 15,000 affordable homes through the use of loan guarantees, flexibilities and capital funding.
  * We also intend to extend our successful refurbishment programme to bring an additional 5,000 existing empty homes back into use. The last Government wanted to demolish Victorian terraces with John Prescott's Pathfinder programme. By contrast, we are getting homes back into productive use.
  * In total we will invest another £300m in these measures to support new affordable homes and bring empty homes into use.
  * We actively want to support home ownership, which fell under the last Parliament despite a Labour pledge to increase it by a million.  
We are extending our successful FirstBuy scheme for first time buyers, with an additional £280 million of funding, helping up to 16,500 additional first time buyers to purchase a home.
  * To free up more brownfield land for development and regeneration, we will accelerate the release of surplus public sector land and empty offices through a targeted programme of transfers from other Government bodies.
  * We will work with local authorities and developers to unlock locally-supported large sites. Just last week, we were back to unblock the Eastern Quarry in the Ebbsfleet Valley - a major ex-industrial sitethat had stalled for a decade.

We are working with local communities and councils. But some councils need to raise their game, by failing to make planning decisions in a timely way. Planning delays create uncertainty both for local residents and local firms. So we will introduce a series of practical measures to help speed up planning decisions and appeals, and major infrastructure.

Some complex developments take time to assemble. So we are allowing for developers to extend the duration of existing planning permissions.

We are making it easier for developers to change unrealistic Section 106 agreements. A development which isn't built means no Section 106 payments. Common sense reforms will result in more regeneration, more housing and more community benefits.

Sustainable development should go hand in hand with environmental safeguards.

I can confirm that we have protected the Green Belt, in line with our commitment in the Coalition Agreement.

It has always the case that councils can amend local Green Belt boundaries should they wish - and we will support councils which choose to. This can include introducing new Green Belt protection around new large developments.

There is considerable previously developed land in many Green Belt areas. We encourage councils to make best use of this land, whilst protecting the openness of the Green Belt in line with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework.

If we are to protect our countryside, we need to focus more growth in our town centres. So we are introducing measures to make it easier to turn empty commercial buildings into housing. Our high streets will benefit from a greater resident population, increasing footfall and supporting local shops.

As a nation, we have great pride in our homes. We want to make it easier for families to undertake home improvements - such as building a new conservatory. So we will be seeking to simplify and increase permitted development rights for householders. Cutting back municipal red tape in this way could provide a particular boost for small traders and small builders.

Mr Speaker, These practical measures build on the housing, local government finance and planning reforms already in play.

Giving more power to individuals, to communities, to councils.

Providing new incentives to support local shops, local firms and local economic growth.

Delivering sustainable development and getting Britain building.

I commend this statement to the House.
",Oral,The Rt Hon Eric Pickles MP,Secretary of State,Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/ericpickles,,6 September 2012,,
http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/planningandbuilding/2211838,Housing and growth,"* * *

The Coalition Government's number one priority is to get the economy growing. We must create the conditions that support local economic growth and remove barriers that stop local businesses creating jobs and getting Britain building again.

In November, the Government published a comprehensive housing strategy and we have rapidly put in place measures set out in the strategy to support a thriving, active and stable housing market.

We are reforming the Right to Buy by significantly increasing the discounts available to tenants to buy their own home. We launched our NewBuy scheme allowing people access to mortgages with only a 5 per cent deposit. And to unblock stalled sites with the capacity for up to 16,000 homes we launched the £570 million Get Britain Building fund. We also announced plans to dispose of public sector land with the capacity to deliver 100,000 homes, and invested £770 million in infrastructure for housing and growth through the Growing Places Fund.

House building starts across England were 29 per cent higher in 2011 compared to 2009. But there is far more to do to provide homes to meet Britain's demographic needs and to help generate local economic growth.

### Increasing investment in the private rented sector

The rented sector already provides good quality homes for many young people, professionals and families. But growth has been constrained by the lack of large scale investment. We invited Sir Adrian Montague to report on the barriers to institutional investment and intend to take up Sir Adrian's key recommendation. Today I can announce that we will be investing £200 million in housing sites to ensure that the high-quality rented homes that are needed are available to institutional investors quickly. And we will be establishing a taskforce to bring together developers, management bodies and institutional investors to broker deals and deliver more rented homes.

The Government will also use its hard earned fiscal credibility to pass on lower costs of borrowing to support the long-term delivery of new rental homes. To give institutional investors the assurance they need to invest in this area we will be issuing a debt guarantee for up to £10 billion for this scheme and the affordable housing scheme set out below. Under the scheme, the Government will enable providers to raise debt with a Government guarantee, where they commit to investing in additional new-build rented homes. From tomorrow, the Government will be inviting expressions of interest from companies wishing to benefit from the scheme. It is expected that housing associations, property management companies and developers will be amongst those to benefit.

### Affordable Housing Guarantees and tackling empty homes

The need for affordable housing remains high. We will therefore be extending the use of guarantees to cover borrowing needed to deliver more affordable homes. Building on the success of the Affordable Homes Programme, the Government will invite bids to provide up to an additional 15,000 affordable homes through the use of loan guarantees, asset management flexibilities and capital funding. We also intend to extend our successful refurbishment programme to bring an additional 5,000 existing empty homes back into use. In total we will invest another £300 million.

### Helping first time buyers

To complement supporting the rented sector, we also want to help those who want to get onto and move up the housing ladder.

Building on our existing schemes, we will continue to support house building and to help people into home ownership through Newbuy - making it easier to access a mortgage with only a 5 per cent deposit. We are working with the Home Builders Federation and the Council of Mortgage Lenders to increase take up and grow the number of builders and lenders in the scheme. I welcome Monday's announcement that Aldermore, have joined the scheme - taking the number of lenders up to six, over 70 per cent of the market. Homebuilders and lenders will work together on a concerted marketing campaign over the Autumn to raise consumer awareness and understanding of scheme.

We will also allocate an additional £280 million, with a matching contribution from house builders, to extend our very successful FirstBuy scheme to March 2014. This will allow up to 16,500 additional first time buyers to purchase a home.

### Accelerating large housing schemes

The need for new homes is acute, and supply remains constrained. There are many large housing schemes in areas of high housing demand that could provide real benefit to local communities once delivered. But, large schemes are complicated and raise a wide range of complex issues that can be difficult to resolve.

Building on success in working with Kent local authorities and developers to unlock major housing opportunities at Eastern Quarry in the Ebbsfleet Valley, the Government will work in partnership with local authorities, scheme promoters and communities to accelerate delivery of locally-supported, major housing sites. These will be sites where there is local support for growth, strong demand for new homes, and good prospects for early delivery.

Off-site construction can create skilled jobs, improve the quality of homes and ultimately bring down costs. An industry-led group convened by DCLG and BIS, will look in detail at the barriers holding back the growth of this part of the sector and how increased use of such techniques can be incentivised. We will ask this advisory group of experts to prepare an proposals by Budget 2013, with the aim of improving the efficiency of housing supply and unlocking high value jobs in the UK.

Thanks to the Government's credible fiscal strategy, homeowners are benefiting from historically low interest rates. However, the private sector needs to be able to access both finance and land to build the homes we need. The Funding for Lending Scheme, run by the Bank of England with the approval of the Government, provides strong incentives for banks and building societies to boost lending, including mortgages and loans to businesses

### Getting surplus public sector land back into use

In response to emerging conclusions from a review chaired by Tony Pidgley, Chairman of the Berkeley Group, the Government will accelerate the release of surplus public sector land by strengthening the role of Homes and Communities Agency outside London through a targeted programme of transfers from other Government Departments and agencies. We will also work to accelerate disposals by preparing the land for market and providing a single 'shop window' for all surplus public sector land. We will work with the Mayor of London with a view to developing a similar approach in London, and to resolve how other measures are delivered for the benefit of Londoners.

### Reducing planning delays

To get more homes built - and more workshops, factories and offices - we need a planning system which works proactively to support the growth that this country needs.

The National Planning Policy Framework is a major step forward. It has been widely welcomed by business, and as a result of its positive influence we are already seeing accelerated plan-making and more positive decision-taking.

We are clear that local people - and local authorities - must be at the heart of planning. The last government tried top-down imposition of growth and unequivocally failed. The imposition of Regional Strategies built nothing but resentment, with house building falling to its lowest peacetime rate since the 1920s.

The Localism Act has put the power to plan back in the hands of communities, but with this power comes responsibility: a responsibility to meet their needs for development and growth, and to deal quickly and effectively with proposals that will deliver homes, jobs and facilities.

Today we are announcing a series of additional measures to drive the effective implementation of these reforms and remove unnecessary bureaucracy that can hinder sustainable growth.

Given the importance of efficient and effective planning decisions for the economy, we need to ensure that where there are clear failures in performance, that applicants are able to access a better service. We propose to legislate to allow applications to be decided by the Planning Inspectorate, if the local authority has a track record of consistently poor performance in the speed or quality of its decisions. Planning is a quasi-judicial process: justice delayed is justice denied. It is unfair to all parties for local planning authorities simply to fail to make timely decisions on a planning application - creating uncertainty both for applicants and local residents.

In support of this we will also require more transparent reporting of council performance on planning, and will be working with the Local Government Association to increase the use of Planning Performance Agreements for major schemes - which commit both applicants and planning authorities to a clear timetable for determining proposals. In addition, we intend to give Planning Inspectors more power to initiate an award of costs in planning appeal proceedings, where it is clear that an application has not been handled as it should have been with due process.

Swift determination of appeals by the Planning Inspectorate is also of critical importance. We will consult shortly on options to speed up planning appeals - and for a new fast-track procedure for some small commercial appeals. I have also instructed the Planning Inspectorate with immediate effect to divert resources to prioritise all major economic and housing related appeals, to ensure applicants receive a response in the quickest possible time.

I have also extended a measure that allows developers the chance to seek additional time to get their sites up and running before planning permission expires, for an additional year. This measure will cut the costs of getting developments back on track.

Getting the infrastructure projects that the country's economic success relies upon underway as swiftly as possible is also a top priority. The planning regime for Major Infrastructure which deals with many of these cases is bedding in well and is bringing benefits through its streamlined and more certain processes. We want to ensure that this planning regime rightly focuses on the most important schemes whilst also extending the benefits of it to other forms of development which are of national importance.

To achieve this we now intend to review the thresholds for some of the existing categories in the regime, and also to bring new categories of commercial and business development into the regime - making it possible for such schemes, where they are of sufficient significance, to be considered and determined at a national level. We will also work to extend the principle of a one-stop-shop for non-planning consents for major infrastructure, and amend the Special Parliamentary procedures which apply to major infrastructure to ensure they are fit for purpose.

### Reducing the cumulative burden of red tape

It is vital that the affordable housing element of Section 106 agreements negotiated during different economic conditions is not allowed to undermine the viability of sites and prevent any construction of new housing. This results in no development, no regeneration and no community benefits at all when agreements are no longer economically viable.

The Government estimates that up to 75,000 new homes are currently stalled due to site viability. S106 is an important tool to provide affordable housing and we welcome the flexible approach that many councils have already taken to renegotiating these agreements where necessary. The Government is also acting to get developers and councils around the table through its new mediation scheme. However, given the current imperative for growth, we need to do more.

The Government will now introduce legislation, to be effective in early 2013, which will allow any developer of sites which are unviable because of the number of affordable homes, to appeal with immediate effect. The Planning Inspectorate will be instructed to assess how many affordable homes would need to be removed from the Section 106 agreement for the site to be viable in current economic conditions. The Planning Inspectorate would then, as necessary, set aside the existing Section 106 agreement for a three year period, in favour of a new agreement with fewer affordable homes. We would encourage councils to take the opportunity before legislation comes into effect to seek negotiated solutions where possible.

Alongside this, the Government is also consulting on legislation that would allow developers to renegotiate non-viable Section 106 agreements entered into prior to April 2010.  
   
There is concern that the array of local and national standards used in different parts the country is complex and counter-productive: confusing local residents, councillors and developers. I am announcing today a fundamental and urgent review led by Government working with interested parties to rationalise these standards. This review will result in a clear plan of action by next spring, including legislative approaches if a significant rationalisation cannot be agreed.

### Supporting locally-led development

We have previously made clear the importance we attach to delivering new large-scale settlements. The recovery criteria already includes large residential developments. To align this with the call-in process, I will also carefully consider the use of call-in for major new settlements with larger than local impacts.

To support locally-led development, communities will share in benefits including the New Homes Bonus, Community Infrastructure Levy contributions towards local infrastructure, and the financial benefits of business rates discounts and forthcoming business rates retention from April 2013.

The Green Belt is an important protection against urban sprawl, providing a 'green lung' around towns and cities. The Coalition Agreement commits the Government to safeguarding Green Belt and other environmental designations, which they have been in the new National Planning Policy Framework. The Localism Act allows for the abolition of Labour's Regional Spatial Strategies which sought to bulldoze the Green Belt around thirty towns and cities across the country, subject to the Strategic Environmental Assessment process, as outlined in my Statement of 3 September 2012, Official Report, Column 5WS.

As has always been the case, councils can review local designations to promote growth. We encourage councils to use the flexibilities set out in the National Planning Policy Framework to tailor the extent of Green Belt land in their areas to reflect local circumstances. Where Green Belt is considered in reviewing or drawing up Local Plans, we will support councils to move quickly through the process by prioritising their Local Plan examinations... There is considerable previously developed land in many Green Belt areas, which could be put to more productive use. We encourage Councils to make best use of this land, whilst protecting the openness of the Green Belt in line with the requirements in the National Planning Policy Framework.

### Helping homeowners improve their homes

As a nation, we have great pride in our homes, and I want to make it easier for families to undertake home improvements: not just to cut red tape and strengthen individual homeowners' rights, but also to help generate economic activity which will support small traders in particular.

I am announcing today a further package of simplification measures to remove red tape and ease the burden on local authorities. We will consult shortly on changes to increase existing permitted development rights for extensions to homes and business premises in non protected areas for a three-year period. This will mean less municipal red tape to build a conservatory and similar small-scale home improvement and free up valuable resources in local authorities.

### Getting empty offices into use

We have already undertaken a series of measures to make change of use easier, to help get empty buildings back into productive use.

We will introduce permitted development rights to enable change of use from commercial to residential purposes, while providing the opportunity for authorities to seek a local exemption where they believe there will be an adverse economic impact. This common sense measure will help the regeneration of our towns and cities. Our high streets will benefit from a greater resident population, increasing footfall and supporting local shops.

This package of measures will ensure that the reforms which we have made to the planning system are implemented as effectively as possible, and that the planning system plays as full a role as possible in supporting local jobs and local firms.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/planningandbuilding/localstatistics,Local statistics,"* * *

I would like to update Hon. Members on changes to the publication of the Department's statistics.

Today my Department has announced its response to the consultation on proposed changes to the Department's statistics. From October this year, we will no longer publish statistics at a government office regional level. Instead the Department will plan to publish, where appropriate, statistics for Local Enterprise Partnerships and upper-tier local authorities, complementing existing statistics by local authority.

The Coalition Government has abolished regional government. The unelected Regional Assemblies/Regional Chambers, the Government Offices for the Regions, the Regional FiReControl programme, the Regional Development Agencies have been terminated, as is intended for the Regional Spatial Strategies, subject to the strategic environment assessment process outlined in my statement of 3 September 2012, _Official Report, Column 5WS_.

The government office regions were an inefficient tier of administration based on arbitrary boundaries. They did not reflect the areas that local residents most identified with, nor were they areas with common economic problems and market conditions, nor were they the most sensible boundaries for coordinating functions such as fire and resilience.

The continuing use of the former government office regional boundaries no longer provides a coherent framework for assessing public policy. Many of the Government's policies now use alternative local geographies, for example Local Enterprise Partnerships, the New Homes Bonus and City Deals. Publishing statistics at a regional level is no longer necessary or informative, and we see little point in producing statistics at taxpayers' expense for their own sake.

The old regional classifications are also misleading - they fail to quantify both the pockets of deprivation that can exist within regions or the differences between rural and urban England, and there is an inconsistency of approach to the size and population of each government region. They are arbitrary lines on a map that have no resonance - in contrast to England's long-standing cities, boroughs and counties which have a real sense of local identity and popular support, dating back centuries in many cases. England has no history of regional government, whereas it does have a great tradition of local governance that this Government wishes to strengthen.

There is also a European dimension to the regions in the form of Eurostat's Nomenclature of Units for Territorial Statistics standard (the appropriately named 'NUTS Regulations'). It is the view of Ministers that the NUTS1 hierarchy is no longer appropriate for Structural Funds in England moving forward from 2014. Ministers reject the notion of a 'Europe of the Regions' where nation-states and national Parliaments are sidelined, and replaced with distant regional governments answerable only to a federal European super-state. Dismantling such arbitrary, unelected regional administrative structures will assist in that goal.

Ministers have carefully considered all the representations made in the consultation. I would note that, for the purposes of historic comparisons, nothing prevents academics and other interested parties from compiling and analysing the open local authority data by the old regional government boundaries, if they wish.

The consultation response also notes the implementation of a new form on local authority housing statistics which reduces and rationalises the data we are asking local authorities to provide, reducing burdens on local government. It also reports on the responses on Land Use Change Statistics which confirmed their importance for monitoring the outcomes of planning policy.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/planningandbuilding/2219130,"Unpublished research reports: Planning, building  and the environment","* * *

Today my Department is publishing the thirteenth group of reports presenting the findings from research projects commissioned by the previous administration.

This Administration inherited a significant backlog of unpublished reports that were commissioned by the previous government which we have been publishing in groups themed on a particular topic.

The reports and findings are of general policy interest, but do not relate to forthcoming policy announcements. We are publishing these documents in the interests of transparency and as part of our Freedom of Information commitment to publish the results of all commissioned research.

The [16 reports](http://www.communities.gov.uk/archived/general-content/corporate/researcharchive/volume13planning/) published today represent the findings from fifteen research projects at a total cost of £1,453,505. These findings cover the topics of building, planning and the environment.

### Planning reports

> (i) _ **Evaluation of minerals policy statements (2 volumes)** _. This report by the British Geological Survey considered the implementation of a number of the Minerals Policy Statements and Minerals Policy Guidance notes, and evaluated the impacts of the policy's implementation. This report was commissioned in January 2010 at a cost of £60,000.
> 
> (ii) _ **Investigating the influence of settlement pattern and morphology on the sterilisation of shallow coal resources** _. This report by the British Geological Survey assessed the impact on shallow coal resources of using separation zones around urban areas. This report was commissioned in January 2010 at a cost of £9,000.
> 
> (iii) ** _Research to understand the rural impacts of Regional Spatial Strategies_ **. This report by Land Use Consultants noted that the Regional Strategies were not rural proofed, had an urban-centred approach and planned housing provision in rural areas was on a declining trend. This report was commissioned in 2009 at a cost of £21,542.
> 
> (iv) _ **A quality local development management service** _. The last Government's Killian Pretty Report recommended that Government should review the then existing national planning indicator (National Indicator 157) on timeliness for progressing planning applications and proposed a new satisfaction with the planning application service indicator. There was concern from applicants, local planning authorities and others that the performance regime focused on the 8 and 13 week timescale targets had unintended effects on behaviours and outcomes. In response the Department commissioned research into alternatives. The research report by Addison & Associates with Arup recommended monitoring 37 different indicators. This report was commissioned in November 2009 at a cost of £72,816.  
   
(v) _ **A tool to assess the Impact of EU Directives on UK Sub National Planning Policies (2 reports)** _. This research by Ove Arup aimed to develop a tool to assess the impact of future EU directives on national planning policies. Directives used in developing this tool included the Marine Strategy Directive, the Water Framework Directive and the Habitats Directive. It noted that EU Directives create significant tensions with the need for development to met demand. The Marine Strategy Directive would cost key business sectors between £439 million to £1.2 billion in additional costs. The research was commissioned in 2009 at a cost of £81,025.

### Building and the environment reports

> (vi) _ **Mapping the standard of existing stock and its turnover** _. This report by Building Research Establishment considered the work to develop a model of the existing housing stock in England and Wales, which could be used in assessing the impact of current and future policy in relation to energy use, carbon emissions and water consumption. This report was commissioned in 2008 at a cost of £56,305.
> 
> (vii) _ **Case studies of change of use of dwellings** _. This report by Faber Maunsell looked at achieving satisfactory acoustic performance for buildings to be converted from industry or commercial use to residential use. Although sound insulation was the main concern of this project, all other relevant requirements of the Building Regulations were to be considered and methods of compliance outlined. This report was commissioned in 2003 at a cost of £115,860.
> 
> (viii) _ **Lessons from Stamford Brook: Understanding the gap between designed and real performance** _. This report by Leeds Metropolitan University conveyed the results of a research designed to evaluate the extent to which low carbon housing standards could be achieved in a large commercial housing development and incorporated into future Building Regulations. The report was commissioned in 2002 and the department's contribution was £215,000.
> 
> (ix) _ **The safety of stairs investigated over a range of rise and goings** _. This report by Building Research Establishment considered people's use of stairs. It conducted analysis of subjective opinions, objective behaviour on stairs and foot placement data to establish the effect of guidance within Part K (Protection from falling, collision and impact) on the design of public, private and institutional stairs and the risk of falling. The report was commissioned in 2003 at a cost of £219,682.
> 
> (x) _ **Investigation of real fires** _. This report by the Building Research Establishment provided feedback on the performance of real buildings in real fires. The findings noted the overall effectiveness of the Building Regulations in providing for the safety of life in the event of fire and most of the significant issues that have been identified during this study fell outside the scope of these regulations. The report was commissioned in 2007 at a cost of £241,067.
> 
> (xi) _ **Modelling the current and potential accessibility of the housing stock** _. This report by Building Research Establishment considered the accessibility of the existing housing stock in England with particular reference to its utility for older and disabled people. The report uses data from the English Housing Condition Survey to identify the frequency and suitability of a range of built features within homes to arrive at an overall assessment of their accessibility and future adaptability. The report was commissioned in 2006 at a cost of £56,305.
> 
> (xii) ** _Future administration of the Energy Performance Buildings Directive Quality Assurance regime_ **. The objective of the work was to set the long term standards and quality assurance arrangements for the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (regime and infrastructure, including Accreditation Schemes (and energy assessors, to ensure that robust, repeatable and accurate Energy Performance Certificates, Display Energy Certificates and Air Conditioning Reports were produced in a consistent manner. It was commissioned in June 2009 at a cost of £75,280.
> 
> (xiii) ** _Review of the impact of the draft European Basic safety standard Directive on Building Regulations_ **. This report by the Building Research Establishment examines the implications of the proposed European ionising radiation Basic Safety Standard Directive for Building Regulations. This research was commissioned in February 2010 at a cost of £24,829.
> 
> (xiv) ** _Glazing under abnormal loads_ **. This report by Buro Happold and the Building Research Establishment addressed the issue of abnormal loads on glazing and the response of glazing systems. The research was commissioned in particular to examine the role of building regulations in mitigating the risks involved from abnormal loads on glazing. It reviewed structural assessment methods currently used to design buildings with glazed systems and assess their adequacy in the area of abnormal loadings. This work was commissioned in October 2003 at a cost of £157,052.
> 
> (xv) _ **Safety of Masonry Parapets** _. The overall aim of this project was to determine and analyse the most common structural problems associated with masonry parapets and the potential hazards and dangers that may arise. Having identified the problems, conclusions and recommendations require to be made regarding measures that ought to be taken in the specification, design, construction and maintenance of masonry parapets to ensure that they remained safe and structurally sound over the service life of the building. This work was commissioned in October 2003 and cost £61,212.
> 
> (xvi) _ **Radon: Current and Future Performance of Radon Protective Measures** _. This report by the Building Research Establishment (BRE) reviews the performance of radon protective measures in new buildings. The research notes that radon protection measures installed 20 years continue to provide a high degree of radon protection, and were not adversely affected by improvements such as extensions, conservatories, double glazing or insulation. This work was commissioned in February 2010 at a cost of £53,505.

These reports and findings are of general policy interest, but do not relate to forthcoming policy announcements and are not necessarily a reflection of the current Government's policies and priorities.

Copies of these reports are available on the Department for Communities and Local Government website. Copies have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.

Today the Government is publishing a group of reports presenting the findings from research projects commissioned by the previous administration.

We are publishing these documents in the interests of transparency and as part of our Freedom of Information commitment to publish the results of all commissioned research. For transparency, all completed work is being published regardless of format or robustness.

The [seven reports](http://www.communities.gov.uk/archived/general-content/corporate/researcharchive/volume12building/) published today represent the findings from seven research projects at a total cost of £190,320. These findings cover the topics of building, planning and the environment.

This research provides an improved evidence base to understand the costs, benefits and practical implications of applying the Lifetime Home Standard to new build housing development. In particular it develops cost analysis which more accurately reflects the likely contribution of access standards to the cumulative impact of regulation on housing supply, and sets out clearly the likely impact on different housing typologies, and on site density.

Although these reports are from the last Administration, they do touch upon current government policy. The Coalition Government has set out in the National Planning Policy Framework that Local Plans must take into account the housing needs of a range of users including older and disabled people. In November's Housing Strategy, this Government also set out its expectation that new development should have a diverse mix of property types, including more accessible designs such as the Lifetime Home Standard. However, we do not intend to introduce national regulation. We believe that decisions should be made at a local level, in proportion to local need and aligned with other local housing support and information services.

### Lifetime Homes Standards

> (i) ** _Modelling the current and potential accessibility of the housing stock_ ** - This report by Building Research Establishment considers the accessibility of the existing housing stock in England with particular reference to its utility for older and disabled people. The report uses data from the English Home Condition Survey to identify the frequency and suitability of a range of built features within homes to arrive at an overall assessment of their accessibility and future adaptability. The report was commissioned in 2006 at a cost of £56,305.
> 
> (ii) _ **Assessing the cost of Lifetime Homes Standards** _ - This report by the Building Cost Information Service (BCIS) looks at establishing the cost impact of introducing the Lifetime Homes Standards in private sector housing, identifying best practice and the potential cost savings that can be delivered through efficiency of design. The report was commissioned in 2009 at a cost of £34,818.
> 
> (iii) ** _Health benefits of Lifetime Home Standards_ ** - This report by the Building Research Establishment sets out findings from work to determine the relative benefits of building to the Lifetime Home Standard. Utilising existing data from the Housing Health and Safety Rating System, the research evaluated the health costs associated with the different levels of harm relating either to direct NHS costs or to societal costs. The report was commissioned in 2009 at a cost of £21,302.
> 
> (iv) ** _Lifetime Homes: Technical forum_ ** - This report by Habinteg Housing Association captures discussions and recommendations which emerged from a Technical Working Group established to test proposals for improving guidance in the Lifetime Home Standard. This report was commissioned in 2009 at a cost of £17,448.
> 
> (v) ** _Analysis of distribution of housing typologies in Public and Private Sector and typical compatibility with the Lifetime Home Standard_ ** - This research conducted by Levitt Bernstein considers the impact of and current compliance with the 16 point standard of _Lifetime Homes Lifetime Neighbourhoods - a National strategy for Housing in an Ageing Society_. Mindful that the standards were originally developed with very suburban 2, 3 and 4 bed detached housing in mind, there was a need to review the 16 point standard and consider the implications of applying it to current and emerging new build housing typologies in England and Wales. The research develops and agrees a model of the variety and distribution of future housing typologies in England and Wales and analyses what impact the application of Lifetime Homes Standards will have on varying house typologies. The study focussed primarily on private sector housing. This report was commissioned in 2009 at a cost of £34,360.
> 
> (vi) ** _Impact on site density of Lifetime Homes_ ** - This research work conducted by Levitt Bernstein is an extension to an earlier piece of work and represents an initial exploration of the impact that the application of Lifetime Homes Standards is likely to have on the site density of private sector housing. It concentrates on low to medium density suburban developments, typically 30-60 dwellings per hectare (dph). The research consisted of a theoretical analysis to calculate the effect on plot size of various increases to plan footprints; an assessment of impact on density on a small sample of typical site layouts in addition to feed back from industry about site density and marketability. This report was commissioned in 2009 at a cost of £16,087.
> 
> (vii) _ **Design of Lifetime homes** _ - This research conducted by Hunt Thomson Architects seeks to evaluate the impact on designing private sectors homes to meet the Lifetime Home Standard, and in particular to understand the likely impact of seeking to minimise both increase in cost and any necessary increase in the overall size of properties by adopting the standard. The project utilised analysis of a range of typical speculative housing development plans and compares these designs with entirely new housing layouts which incorporate the 16 elements of the Lifetime Home Standard. This report was commissioned in 2009 at a cost of £10,000.

At a time when public budgets must be reduced, the new Government wants to ensure its research delivers best possible value for money for the taxpayer and that sums expended are reasonable in relation to the public policy benefits obtained. My department has put in place new scrutiny and challenge processes for future research.

Any new projects will be scrutinised to ensure the methodology is sound and that all options for funding are explored at an early stage. This includes using existing work from other organisations, joint funding projects with other departments or organisations and taking work forward in-house.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/planningandbuilding/2189482,Abolition of Regional Strategies,"* * *

It is the Government's policy to revoke existing regional strategies outside London, reflecting manifesto commitments made by both Coalition parties in the 2010 general election and subsequently incorporated into the Coalition Agreement. The Localism Act 2011 provides for the abolition of regional strategies in a two-stage process. The first stage, to remove the regional planning framework and prevent further strategies from being created, took effect when the Localism Act received Royal Assent on 15 November. The second stage would be to abolish the existing regional strategies by secondary legislation. However, any final decision on this must take account of assessments of, and consultation on, the possible environmental effects of revocation of each of the existing regional strategies.

The Strategic Environmental Assessment process is set out in an EU Directive (Directive 2001/42/EC). In March 2012, the European Court of Justice issued a significant ruling on the interpretation and application of the Directive (Inter-Environnement Bruxelles ASBL & Others v Government of the Brussels-Capital Region).

As part of the Strategic Environmental Assessment process, and before the decision of the European Court of Justice, there has already been consultation with the statutory consultation bodies on the scope and level of detail of the environmental reports. Public consultation took place between October 2011 and January 2012 on the basis of environmental reports published in October 2011. Detailed responses were provided in the course of this exercise.  
   
Following the decision of the European Court of Justice, in the light of planning policy and legislation that have been put in place since January 2012, in light of the earlier consultation responses, and in order to be meticulous in observing the requirements of the Directive, the Government is now updating the environmental reports and undertaking additional consultation. We are publishing the first of the updated environmental reports: the report in respect of the proposed [revocation of the East of England Regional Strategy](http://www.communities.gov.uk/planningandbuilding/planningenvironment/strategicenvironmentassess/) shortly and will place a copy in the Libraries of both Houses. This report builds on and is intended to supersede the previous report.

The period for consultation responses will remain open for eight weeks. We welcome and encourage all interested parties to respond. At the end of that period we will consider all consultation responses, including those already submitted during the October 2011 to January 2012 response period.

In the coming weeks my Department will publish updated environmental reports relating to the proposals on each of the other regional strategies, so that those proposals too can be the subject of additional consultation. In each case there will be an 8 week period for consultation responses. All updated environmental reports will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses as they are published.

The proposed revocation of the Regional Strategies may be regarded as a material consideration by decision makers when determining planning applications and appeals.

In respect of plan-making, the National Planning Policy Framework implementation period provides councils with the incentive to get their plan policies up to date and in doing so they can have regard to the policy to revoke Regional Strategies and the new National Planning Policy Framework policies. A local plan document must be in general conformity with the regional strategy at the stage that the plan is submitted for examination but it is open to councils when preparing local plans to take account of the policy to revoke up to the time of submission. Local authorities can also bring forward proposals (for example on housing targets) which have a local interpretation to them in their plans, based on their own sound evidence base where that is justified by the local circumstances. That evidence base is likely to be more up to date than that included in the Regional Strategies. Each case will depend on its particular facts.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/regeneration/2211838,Housing and growth,"* * *

The Coalition Government's number one priority is to get the economy growing. We must create the conditions that support local economic growth and remove barriers that stop local businesses creating jobs and getting Britain building again.

In November, the Government published a comprehensive housing strategy and we have rapidly put in place measures set out in the strategy to support a thriving, active and stable housing market.

We are reforming the Right to Buy by significantly increasing the discounts available to tenants to buy their own home. We launched our NewBuy scheme allowing people access to mortgages with only a 5 per cent deposit. And to unblock stalled sites with the capacity for up to 16,000 homes we launched the £570 million Get Britain Building fund. We also announced plans to dispose of public sector land with the capacity to deliver 100,000 homes, and invested £770 million in infrastructure for housing and growth through the Growing Places Fund.

House building starts across England were 29 per cent higher in 2011 compared to 2009. But there is far more to do to provide homes to meet Britain's demographic needs and to help generate local economic growth.

### Increasing investment in the private rented sector

The rented sector already provides good quality homes for many young people, professionals and families. But growth has been constrained by the lack of large scale investment. We invited Sir Adrian Montague to report on the barriers to institutional investment and intend to take up Sir Adrian's key recommendation. Today I can announce that we will be investing £200 million in housing sites to ensure that the high-quality rented homes that are needed are available to institutional investors quickly. And we will be establishing a taskforce to bring together developers, management bodies and institutional investors to broker deals and deliver more rented homes.

The Government will also use its hard earned fiscal credibility to pass on lower costs of borrowing to support the long-term delivery of new rental homes. To give institutional investors the assurance they need to invest in this area we will be issuing a debt guarantee for up to £10 billion for this scheme and the affordable housing scheme set out below. Under the scheme, the Government will enable providers to raise debt with a Government guarantee, where they commit to investing in additional new-build rented homes. From tomorrow, the Government will be inviting expressions of interest from companies wishing to benefit from the scheme. It is expected that housing associations, property management companies and developers will be amongst those to benefit.

### Affordable Housing Guarantees and tackling empty homes

The need for affordable housing remains high. We will therefore be extending the use of guarantees to cover borrowing needed to deliver more affordable homes. Building on the success of the Affordable Homes Programme, the Government will invite bids to provide up to an additional 15,000 affordable homes through the use of loan guarantees, asset management flexibilities and capital funding. We also intend to extend our successful refurbishment programme to bring an additional 5,000 existing empty homes back into use. In total we will invest another £300 million.

### Helping first time buyers

To complement supporting the rented sector, we also want to help those who want to get onto and move up the housing ladder.

Building on our existing schemes, we will continue to support house building and to help people into home ownership through Newbuy - making it easier to access a mortgage with only a 5 per cent deposit. We are working with the Home Builders Federation and the Council of Mortgage Lenders to increase take up and grow the number of builders and lenders in the scheme. I welcome Monday's announcement that Aldermore, have joined the scheme - taking the number of lenders up to six, over 70 per cent of the market. Homebuilders and lenders will work together on a concerted marketing campaign over the Autumn to raise consumer awareness and understanding of scheme.

We will also allocate an additional £280 million, with a matching contribution from house builders, to extend our very successful FirstBuy scheme to March 2014. This will allow up to 16,500 additional first time buyers to purchase a home.

### Accelerating large housing schemes

The need for new homes is acute, and supply remains constrained. There are many large housing schemes in areas of high housing demand that could provide real benefit to local communities once delivered. But, large schemes are complicated and raise a wide range of complex issues that can be difficult to resolve.

Building on success in working with Kent local authorities and developers to unlock major housing opportunities at Eastern Quarry in the Ebbsfleet Valley, the Government will work in partnership with local authorities, scheme promoters and communities to accelerate delivery of locally-supported, major housing sites. These will be sites where there is local support for growth, strong demand for new homes, and good prospects for early delivery.

Off-site construction can create skilled jobs, improve the quality of homes and ultimately bring down costs. An industry-led group convened by DCLG and BIS, will look in detail at the barriers holding back the growth of this part of the sector and how increased use of such techniques can be incentivised. We will ask this advisory group of experts to prepare an proposals by Budget 2013, with the aim of improving the efficiency of housing supply and unlocking high value jobs in the UK.

Thanks to the Government's credible fiscal strategy, homeowners are benefiting from historically low interest rates. However, the private sector needs to be able to access both finance and land to build the homes we need. The Funding for Lending Scheme, run by the Bank of England with the approval of the Government, provides strong incentives for banks and building societies to boost lending, including mortgages and loans to businesses

### Getting surplus public sector land back into use

In response to emerging conclusions from a review chaired by Tony Pidgley, Chairman of the Berkeley Group, the Government will accelerate the release of surplus public sector land by strengthening the role of Homes and Communities Agency outside London through a targeted programme of transfers from other Government Departments and agencies. We will also work to accelerate disposals by preparing the land for market and providing a single 'shop window' for all surplus public sector land. We will work with the Mayor of London with a view to developing a similar approach in London, and to resolve how other measures are delivered for the benefit of Londoners.

### Reducing planning delays

To get more homes built - and more workshops, factories and offices - we need a planning system which works proactively to support the growth that this country needs.

The National Planning Policy Framework is a major step forward. It has been widely welcomed by business, and as a result of its positive influence we are already seeing accelerated plan-making and more positive decision-taking.

We are clear that local people - and local authorities - must be at the heart of planning. The last government tried top-down imposition of growth and unequivocally failed. The imposition of Regional Strategies built nothing but resentment, with house building falling to its lowest peacetime rate since the 1920s.

The Localism Act has put the power to plan back in the hands of communities, but with this power comes responsibility: a responsibility to meet their needs for development and growth, and to deal quickly and effectively with proposals that will deliver homes, jobs and facilities.

Today we are announcing a series of additional measures to drive the effective implementation of these reforms and remove unnecessary bureaucracy that can hinder sustainable growth.

Given the importance of efficient and effective planning decisions for the economy, we need to ensure that where there are clear failures in performance, that applicants are able to access a better service. We propose to legislate to allow applications to be decided by the Planning Inspectorate, if the local authority has a track record of consistently poor performance in the speed or quality of its decisions. Planning is a quasi-judicial process: justice delayed is justice denied. It is unfair to all parties for local planning authorities simply to fail to make timely decisions on a planning application - creating uncertainty both for applicants and local residents.

In support of this we will also require more transparent reporting of council performance on planning, and will be working with the Local Government Association to increase the use of Planning Performance Agreements for major schemes - which commit both applicants and planning authorities to a clear timetable for determining proposals. In addition, we intend to give Planning Inspectors more power to initiate an award of costs in planning appeal proceedings, where it is clear that an application has not been handled as it should have been with due process.

Swift determination of appeals by the Planning Inspectorate is also of critical importance. We will consult shortly on options to speed up planning appeals - and for a new fast-track procedure for some small commercial appeals. I have also instructed the Planning Inspectorate with immediate effect to divert resources to prioritise all major economic and housing related appeals, to ensure applicants receive a response in the quickest possible time.

I have also extended a measure that allows developers the chance to seek additional time to get their sites up and running before planning permission expires, for an additional year. This measure will cut the costs of getting developments back on track.

Getting the infrastructure projects that the country's economic success relies upon underway as swiftly as possible is also a top priority. The planning regime for Major Infrastructure which deals with many of these cases is bedding in well and is bringing benefits through its streamlined and more certain processes. We want to ensure that this planning regime rightly focuses on the most important schemes whilst also extending the benefits of it to other forms of development which are of national importance.

To achieve this we now intend to review the thresholds for some of the existing categories in the regime, and also to bring new categories of commercial and business development into the regime - making it possible for such schemes, where they are of sufficient significance, to be considered and determined at a national level. We will also work to extend the principle of a one-stop-shop for non-planning consents for major infrastructure, and amend the Special Parliamentary procedures which apply to major infrastructure to ensure they are fit for purpose.

### Reducing the cumulative burden of red tape

It is vital that the affordable housing element of Section 106 agreements negotiated during different economic conditions is not allowed to undermine the viability of sites and prevent any construction of new housing. This results in no development, no regeneration and no community benefits at all when agreements are no longer economically viable.

The Government estimates that up to 75,000 new homes are currently stalled due to site viability. S106 is an important tool to provide affordable housing and we welcome the flexible approach that many councils have already taken to renegotiating these agreements where necessary. The Government is also acting to get developers and councils around the table through its new mediation scheme. However, given the current imperative for growth, we need to do more.

The Government will now introduce legislation, to be effective in early 2013, which will allow any developer of sites which are unviable because of the number of affordable homes, to appeal with immediate effect. The Planning Inspectorate will be instructed to assess how many affordable homes would need to be removed from the Section 106 agreement for the site to be viable in current economic conditions. The Planning Inspectorate would then, as necessary, set aside the existing Section 106 agreement for a three year period, in favour of a new agreement with fewer affordable homes. We would encourage councils to take the opportunity before legislation comes into effect to seek negotiated solutions where possible.

Alongside this, the Government is also consulting on legislation that would allow developers to renegotiate non-viable Section 106 agreements entered into prior to April 2010.  
   
There is concern that the array of local and national standards used in different parts the country is complex and counter-productive: confusing local residents, councillors and developers. I am announcing today a fundamental and urgent review led by Government working with interested parties to rationalise these standards. This review will result in a clear plan of action by next spring, including legislative approaches if a significant rationalisation cannot be agreed.

### Supporting locally-led development

We have previously made clear the importance we attach to delivering new large-scale settlements. The recovery criteria already includes large residential developments. To align this with the call-in process, I will also carefully consider the use of call-in for major new settlements with larger than local impacts.

To support locally-led development, communities will share in benefits including the New Homes Bonus, Community Infrastructure Levy contributions towards local infrastructure, and the financial benefits of business rates discounts and forthcoming business rates retention from April 2013.

The Green Belt is an important protection against urban sprawl, providing a 'green lung' around towns and cities. The Coalition Agreement commits the Government to safeguarding Green Belt and other environmental designations, which they have been in the new National Planning Policy Framework. The Localism Act allows for the abolition of Labour's Regional Spatial Strategies which sought to bulldoze the Green Belt around thirty towns and cities across the country, subject to the Strategic Environmental Assessment process, as outlined in my Statement of 3 September 2012, Official Report, Column 5WS.

As has always been the case, councils can review local designations to promote growth. We encourage councils to use the flexibilities set out in the National Planning Policy Framework to tailor the extent of Green Belt land in their areas to reflect local circumstances. Where Green Belt is considered in reviewing or drawing up Local Plans, we will support councils to move quickly through the process by prioritising their Local Plan examinations... There is considerable previously developed land in many Green Belt areas, which could be put to more productive use. We encourage Councils to make best use of this land, whilst protecting the openness of the Green Belt in line with the requirements in the National Planning Policy Framework.

### Helping homeowners improve their homes

As a nation, we have great pride in our homes, and I want to make it easier for families to undertake home improvements: not just to cut red tape and strengthen individual homeowners' rights, but also to help generate economic activity which will support small traders in particular.

I am announcing today a further package of simplification measures to remove red tape and ease the burden on local authorities. We will consult shortly on changes to increase existing permitted development rights for extensions to homes and business premises in non protected areas for a three-year period. This will mean less municipal red tape to build a conservatory and similar small-scale home improvement and free up valuable resources in local authorities.

### Getting empty offices into use

We have already undertaken a series of measures to make change of use easier, to help get empty buildings back into productive use.

We will introduce permitted development rights to enable change of use from commercial to residential purposes, while providing the opportunity for authorities to seek a local exemption where they believe there will be an adverse economic impact. This common sense measure will help the regeneration of our towns and cities. Our high streets will benefit from a greater resident population, increasing footfall and supporting local shops.

This package of measures will ensure that the reforms which we have made to the planning system are implemented as effectively as possible, and that the planning system plays as full a role as possible in supporting local jobs and local firms.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/regeneration/2239809,Business Rates,"* * *

I am today announcing the Government's intention to postpone the next business rates revaluation in England to 2017. Primary legislation will be brought forward through the Growth and Infrastructure Bill which will shortly be laid before Parliament.

Business rates are the third biggest outgoing for local firms after rent and staff costs. This decision will avoid local firms and local shops facing unexpected hikes in their business rate bills over the next five years. As business rates are linked to inflation, there will be no real terms increase in rates over this period. This reform will provide certainty for business to plan and invest, supporting local economic growth.

Since the last revaluation (based on 2008 valuations), the economy and property market have faced exceptional changes. A revaluation at this point would be likely to result in sharp changes to business rate bills in many parts of the country and in many sectors. Tax stability is vital to businesses looking to grow and help improve the economy.

The Government is committed to maintaining up to date rate bills through regular five yearly revaluations in England which will resume after 2017, once the economy has had a chance to recover fully from the financial and fiscal crisis this Government inherited from the last Administration.

These measures complement the local retention of business rates being introduced through the Local Government Finance Bill which will give councils new incentives to support local firms and local shops, and also complements the new power to introduce local business rate discounts, the automation of small business rate relief and the abolition of the unfair 'ports tax' all enacted through the Localism Act 2011.

BIS Minister of State for Business and Enterprise (Michael Fallon) and the DCLG Minister of State for Housing (Mark Prisk) are today announcing that £25m of Government funding will be made available to support local enterprise partnerships in their pursuit of economic growth.

Government's goal is to promote strong, sustainable and balanced growth across the UK. Local enterprise partnerships are central to our approach to driving local economic growth and for ensuring that every locality is able to fulfil its potential. Local enterprise partnerships are voluntary partnerships of business and civic leaders, working across local economic areas, and have a vitally important role in identifying opportunities for private sector growth and addressing local barriers to growth through the united efforts of their partners.

Local enterprise partnerships have also been encouraged to identify local barriers to growth where government action can address some of the specific barriers. Ministers across government are committed to supporting local enterprise partnerships achieve their local growth priorities and tackle the barriers to progress.

In response to recent strong representations BIS and DCLG have decided to offer jointly up to £250k pa of matched core funding to local enterprise partnerships for the remainder of this Parliament (until 2014/15), subject to satisfactory proposals being received. We will offer each local enterprise partnership a one-off initial payment of £125k for the remainder of this financial year to provide immediate support, with subsequent years funding dependent on matched funding from local partners. Where matched by funds locally the overall funding pot could equate up to £45m over this period. With this offer of core resources, local enterprise partnerships will be asked to ensure that they have a clear set of priorities for local growth in place.

Local enterprise partnerships will remain voluntary business and civic partnerships to drive sustainable private sector growth and job creation in their area. This offer of core resource funding will provide more capacity for local enterprise partnerships to drive forward their growth priorities, allow them to do longer term resource planning and strengthen support and autonomy of the business-led boards.

### Getting surplus public sector land back into use

In response to emerging conclusions from a review chaired by Tony Pidgley, Chairman of the Berkeley Group, the Government will accelerate the release of surplus public sector land by strengthening the role of Homes and Communities Agency outside London through a targeted programme of transfers from other Government Departments and agencies. We will also work to accelerate disposals by preparing the land for market and providing a single 'shop window' for all surplus public sector land. We will work with the Mayor of London with a view to developing a similar approach in London, and to resolve how other measures are delivered for the benefit of Londoners.

### Reducing planning delays

To get more homes built - and more workshops, factories and offices - we need a planning system which works proactively to support the growth that this country needs.

The National Planning Policy Framework is a major step forward. It has been widely welcomed by business, and as a result of its positive influence we are already seeing accelerated plan-making and more positive decision-taking.

We are clear that local people - and local authorities - must be at the heart of planning. The last government tried top-down imposition of growth and unequivocally failed. The imposition of Regional Strategies built nothing but resentment, with house building falling to its lowest peacetime rate since the 1920s.

The Localism Act has put the power to plan back in the hands of communities, but with this power comes responsibility: a responsibility to meet their needs for development and growth, and to deal quickly and effectively with proposals that will deliver homes, jobs and facilities.

Today we are announcing a series of additional measures to drive the effective implementation of these reforms and remove unnecessary bureaucracy that can hinder sustainable growth.

Given the importance of efficient and effective planning decisions for the economy, we need to ensure that where there are clear failures in performance, that applicants are able to access a better service. We propose to legislate to allow applications to be decided by the Planning Inspectorate, if the local authority has a track record of consistently poor performance in the speed or quality of its decisions. Planning is a quasi-judicial process: justice delayed is justice denied. It is unfair to all parties for local planning authorities simply to fail to make timely decisions on a planning application - creating uncertainty both for applicants and local residents.

In support of this we will also require more transparent reporting of council performance on planning, and will be working with the Local Government Association to increase the use of Planning Performance Agreements for major schemes - which commit both applicants and planning authorities to a clear timetable for determining proposals. In addition, we intend to give Planning Inspectors more power to initiate an award of costs in planning appeal proceedings, where it is clear that an application has not been handled as it should have been with due process.

Swift determination of appeals by the Planning Inspectorate is also of critical importance. We will consult shortly on options to speed up planning appeals - and for a new fast-track procedure for some small commercial appeals. I have also instructed the Planning Inspectorate with immediate effect to divert resources to prioritise all major economic and housing related appeals, to ensure applicants receive a response in the quickest possible time.

I have also extended a measure that allows developers the chance to seek additional time to get their sites up and running before planning permission expires, for an additional year. This measure will cut the costs of getting developments back on track.

Getting the infrastructure projects that the country's economic success relies upon underway as swiftly as possible is also a top priority. The planning regime for Major Infrastructure which deals with many of these cases is bedding in well and is bringing benefits through its streamlined and more certain processes. We want to ensure that this planning regime rightly focuses on the most important schemes whilst also extending the benefits of it to other forms of development which are of national importance.

To achieve this we now intend to review the thresholds for some of the existing categories in the regime, and also to bring new categories of commercial and business development into the regime - making it possible for such schemes, where they are of sufficient significance, to be considered and determined at a national level. We will also work to extend the principle of a one-stop-shop for non-planning consents for major infrastructure, and amend the Special Parliamentary procedures which apply to major infrastructure to ensure they are fit for purpose.

### Reducing the cumulative burden of red tape

It is vital that the affordable housing element of Section 106 agreements negotiated during different economic conditions is not allowed to undermine the viability of sites and prevent any construction of new housing. This results in no development, no regeneration and no community benefits at all when agreements are no longer economically viable.

The Government estimates that up to 75,000 new homes are currently stalled due to site viability. S106 is an important tool to provide affordable housing and we welcome the flexible approach that many councils have already taken to renegotiating these agreements where necessary. The Government is also acting to get developers and councils around the table through its new mediation scheme. However, given the current imperative for growth, we need to do more.

The Government will now introduce legislation, to be effective in early 2013, which will allow any developer of sites which are unviable because of the number of affordable homes, to appeal with immediate effect. The Planning Inspectorate will be instructed to assess how many affordable homes would need to be removed from the Section 106 agreement for the site to be viable in current economic conditions. The Planning Inspectorate would then, as necessary, set aside the existing Section 106 agreement for a three year period, in favour of a new agreement with fewer affordable homes. We would encourage councils to take the opportunity before legislation comes into effect to seek negotiated solutions where possible.

Alongside this, the Government is also consulting on legislation that would allow developers to renegotiate non-viable Section 106 agreements entered into prior to April 2010.  
   
There is concern that the array of local and national standards used in different parts the country is complex and counter-productive: confusing local residents, councillors and developers. I am announcing today a fundamental and urgent review led by Government working with interested parties to rationalise these standards. This review will result in a clear plan of action by next spring, including legislative approaches if a significant rationalisation cannot be agreed.

### Supporting locally-led development

We have previously made clear the importance we attach to delivering new large-scale settlements. The recovery criteria already includes large residential developments. To align this with the call-in process, I will also carefully consider the use of call-in for major new settlements with larger than local impacts.

To support locally-led development, communities will share in benefits including the New Homes Bonus, Community Infrastructure Levy contributions towards local infrastructure, and the financial benefits of business rates discounts and forthcoming business rates retention from April 2013.

The Green Belt is an important protection against urban sprawl, providing a 'green lung' around towns and cities. The Coalition Agreement commits the Government to safeguarding Green Belt and other environmental designations, which they have been in the new National Planning Policy Framework. The Localism Act allows for the abolition of Labour's Regional Spatial Strategies which sought to bulldoze the Green Belt around thirty towns and cities across the country, subject to the Strategic Environmental Assessment process, as outlined in my Statement of 3 September 2012, Official Report, Column 5WS.

As has always been the case, councils can review local designations to promote growth. We encourage councils to use the flexibilities set out in the National Planning Policy Framework to tailor the extent of Green Belt land in their areas to reflect local circumstances. Where Green Belt is considered in reviewing or drawing up Local Plans, we will support councils to move quickly through the process by prioritising their Local Plan examinations... There is considerable previously developed land in many Green Belt areas, which could be put to more productive use. We encourage Councils to make best use of this land, whilst protecting the openness of the Green Belt in line with the requirements in the National Planning Policy Framework.

### Helping homeowners improve their homes

As a nation, we have great pride in our homes, and I want to make it easier for families to undertake home improvements: not just to cut red tape and strengthen individual homeowners' rights, but also to help generate economic activity which will support small traders in particular.

I am announcing today a further package of simplification measures to remove red tape and ease the burden on local authorities. We will consult shortly on changes to increase existing permitted development rights for extensions to homes and business premises in non protected areas for a three-year period. This will mean less municipal red tape to build a conservatory and similar small-scale home improvement and free up valuable resources in local authorities.

### Getting empty offices into use

We have already undertaken a series of measures to make change of use easier, to help get empty buildings back into productive use.

We will introduce permitted development rights to enable change of use from commercial to residential purposes, while providing the opportunity for authorities to seek a local exemption where they believe there will be an adverse economic impact. This common sense measure will help the regeneration of our towns and cities. Our high streets will benefit from a greater resident population, increasing footfall and supporting local shops.

This package of measures will ensure that the reforms which we have made to the planning system are implemented as effectively as possible, and that the planning system plays as full a role as possible in supporting local jobs and local firms.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/newsroom/2188820,Legacy FiReControl buildings,"* * *

I want to update the House on my Department's progress with the Regional Control Centre buildings - the main legacy asset of the terminated FiReControl project from the last Administration.

The nine Regional Control Centre buildings were procured through a private developer scheme from 2004 onwards and completed between June 2007 and February 2010. The leases run for 20 or 25 years from completion. As noted on 26 January 2009, _Official Report_, House of Commons, Column 108W, the last Administration decided not to include break clauses in the contracts, forcing taxpayers to shoulder the ultimate liability for the empty buildings.

The National Audit Office, in their report _The Failure of Fire Control_, were highly critical of the top-down FiReControl project. They stated:

> ""The FiReControl project was flawed from the outset because it did not have the support of those essential to its success - local fire and rescue services. The Department rushed the start of the project, failing to follow proper procedures. Ineffective checks and balances during initiation and early stages meant the Department committed itself to the project on the basis of broad-brush and inaccurate estimates of costs and benefits and an unrealistic delivery timetable, and agreed an inadequate contract with its IT supplier. The Department under-appreciated the project's complexity, and then mismanaged the IT contractor's performance and delivery. The Department failed to provide the necessary leadership to make the project successful, over-relying on poorly managed consultants and failing to sort out early problems with delivery by the contractor. The Department took a firmer grip of the project from 2009 and terminated the contract in December 2010 to avoid even more money being wasted""  
(National Audit Office, _The Failure of the FiReControl project_, HC1272, 1 July 2011).

Following the termination of the FiReControl project in December 2010 by the Coalition Government, my Department explored whether fire and rescue authorities could make use of the centres as they were purpose built for control services. Our next preference was for other emergency services to take over the buildings. Our prime aims were to ensure value for taxpayers' money and achieve a localist approach to improvements in resilience.

I can report success for four of the buildings. One is already in use as a control centre and three further buildings will be used by emergency services, as follows:

  * The London building was officially opened on 1 February 2012 - in good time for the Olympic and Paralympic Games - and is fully operational as the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority's control centre.
  * As announced by the Minister for Shipping on 22 November 2011, _Official Report_, House of Commons, Column 163, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency will use the Fareham building as their Operations Centre.
  * The Warrington building will be used as a shared control service for four fire authorities (Greater Manchester, Cheshire, Lancashire and Cumbria).
  * County Durham and Darlington Fire and Rescue Authority will use the Durham building as their new headquarters and control room.

Having sought public sector tenants, my Department is launching a marketing campaign to attract tenants from a wider range of organisations for the remaining five buildings, including from the private sector. These buildings are located in Wolverhampton, Cambridge, Taunton, Wakefield and Castle Donington. They are built to a high specification and have a number of desirable features, including excellent resilience, good security and easy access to major road networks. Buyers of the control rooms will also benefit from the £6,000 a piece deluxe, polished chrome 'Brasilia' espresso machines that were purchased for each of the centres by the last Administration (as outlined on 15 March 2010, _Official Report_, House of Commons, Column 665W).

Marketing begins in late July, with sale boards going up at the five buildings. Other marketing activities will comprise some print and online advertising, a brochure for interested organisations, a dedicated website and site visits. My Department has looked for cost effective marketing channels, including no-cost and low-cost routes, and will keep the outcomes under review in order to assess effectiveness and progress.

In the meantime, we have taken firm steps to reduce the costs of the unused control centres. For example, the facilities management bill has been reduced by 25 per cent and the utilities bill by 35 per cent. A second review of the facilities management arrangements will result in a further reduction from April 2013. While we will continue to seek to drive down these costs to make savings for the taxpayer, the largest saving will come from finding suitable tenants to take over the buildings.

I want to inform the House of my Department's intention to provide an Authorised Guarantee Agreement to the landlord of the North West Regional Control Centre building. This statement sits alongside a departmental minute I have laid before the House setting out the contingent liability associated with the provision of an Authorised Guarantee Agreement.

As set out in the departmental minute, the lease for the North West Control Centre in Warrington has been assigned to NW Fire Control Ltd, a consortium of four fire and rescue authorities. The consortium will use the building to provide a shared control service. This is positive news, which will result in emergency calls being taken in a specialist, highly resilient, purpose-built centre. We are providing an Authorised Guarantee Agreement to the landlord, as provided for in the lease.

My Department and NW Fire Control Ltd have already entered into a formal agreement regarding the control centre building for the lifetime of the lease, which runs until 2033. As such, we expect there to be no costs to Government from the provision of this Authorised Guarantee Agreement.

It is clearly unsatisfactory that taxpayers have had to foot the bill for this poorly conceived and poorly implemented project from the last Administration, and taxpayers will no doubt resent such expensive buildings lying empty because of the botched procurement and handling of FireControl under the last Government. However, the Coalition Government has taken firm action to protect the public purse from the botched programme and sought to minimise the cost of these inherited liabilities, in as far as we are able to given the constraints of the contracts that were signed.

Ministers will continue to keep Parliament informed of progress.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/newsroom/localstatistics,Local statistics,"* * *

I would like to update Hon. Members on changes to the publication of the Department's statistics.

Today my Department has announced its response to the consultation on proposed changes to the Department's statistics. From October this year, we will no longer publish statistics at a government office regional level. Instead the Department will plan to publish, where appropriate, statistics for Local Enterprise Partnerships and upper-tier local authorities, complementing existing statistics by local authority.

The Coalition Government has abolished regional government. The unelected Regional Assemblies/Regional Chambers, the Government Offices for the Regions, the Regional FiReControl programme, the Regional Development Agencies have been terminated, as is intended for the Regional Spatial Strategies, subject to the strategic environment assessment process outlined in my statement of 3 September 2012, _Official Report, Column 5WS_.

The government office regions were an inefficient tier of administration based on arbitrary boundaries. They did not reflect the areas that local residents most identified with, nor were they areas with common economic problems and market conditions, nor were they the most sensible boundaries for coordinating functions such as fire and resilience.

The continuing use of the former government office regional boundaries no longer provides a coherent framework for assessing public policy. Many of the Government's policies now use alternative local geographies, for example Local Enterprise Partnerships, the New Homes Bonus and City Deals. Publishing statistics at a regional level is no longer necessary or informative, and we see little point in producing statistics at taxpayers' expense for their own sake.

The old regional classifications are also misleading - they fail to quantify both the pockets of deprivation that can exist within regions or the differences between rural and urban England, and there is an inconsistency of approach to the size and population of each government region. They are arbitrary lines on a map that have no resonance - in contrast to England's long-standing cities, boroughs and counties which have a real sense of local identity and popular support, dating back centuries in many cases. England has no history of regional government, whereas it does have a great tradition of local governance that this Government wishes to strengthen.

There is also a European dimension to the regions in the form of Eurostat's Nomenclature of Units for Territorial Statistics standard (the appropriately named 'NUTS Regulations'). It is the view of Ministers that the NUTS1 hierarchy is no longer appropriate for Structural Funds in England moving forward from 2014. Ministers reject the notion of a 'Europe of the Regions' where nation-states and national Parliaments are sidelined, and replaced with distant regional governments answerable only to a federal European super-state. Dismantling such arbitrary, unelected regional administrative structures will assist in that goal.

Ministers have carefully considered all the representations made in the consultation. I would note that, for the purposes of historic comparisons, nothing prevents academics and other interested parties from compiling and analysing the open local authority data by the old regional government boundaries, if they wish.

The consultation response also notes the implementation of a new form on local authority housing statistics which reduces and rationalises the data we are asking local authorities to provide, reducing burdens on local government. It also reports on the responses on Land Use Change Statistics which confirmed their importance for monitoring the outcomes of planning policy.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/newsroom/2218868,"Unpublished research reports: Planning, building  and the environment","* * *

Today my Department is publishing the thirteenth group of reports presenting the findings from research projects commissioned by the previous administration.

This Administration inherited a significant backlog of unpublished reports that were commissioned by the previous government which we have been publishing in groups themed on a particular topic.

The reports and findings are of general policy interest, but do not relate to forthcoming policy announcements. We are publishing these documents in the interests of transparency and as part of our Freedom of Information commitment to publish the results of all commissioned research.

The [16 reports](http://www.communities.gov.uk/archived/general-content/corporate/researcharchive/volume13planning/) published today represent the findings from fifteen research projects at a total cost of £1,453,505. These findings cover the topics of building, planning and the environment.

### Planning reports

> (i) _ **Evaluation of minerals policy statements (2 volumes)** _. This report by the British Geological Survey considered the implementation of a number of the Minerals Policy Statements and Minerals Policy Guidance notes, and evaluated the impacts of the policy's implementation. This report was commissioned in January 2010 at a cost of £60,000.
> 
> (ii) _ **Investigating the influence of settlement pattern and morphology on the sterilisation of shallow coal resources** _. This report by the British Geological Survey assessed the impact on shallow coal resources of using separation zones around urban areas. This report was commissioned in January 2010 at a cost of £9,000.
> 
> (iii) ** _Research to understand the rural impacts of Regional Spatial Strategies_ **. This report by Land Use Consultants noted that the Regional Strategies were not rural proofed, had an urban-centred approach and planned housing provision in rural areas was on a declining trend. This report was commissioned in 2009 at a cost of £21,542.
> 
> (iv) _ **A quality local development management service** _. The last Government's Killian Pretty Report recommended that Government should review the then existing national planning indicator (National Indicator 157) on timeliness for progressing planning applications and proposed a new satisfaction with the planning application service indicator. There was concern from applicants, local planning authorities and others that the performance regime focused on the 8 and 13 week timescale targets had unintended effects on behaviours and outcomes. In response the Department commissioned research into alternatives. The research report by Addison & Associates with Arup recommended monitoring 37 different indicators. This report was commissioned in November 2009 at a cost of £72,816.  
   
(v) _ **A tool to assess the Impact of EU Directives on UK Sub National Planning Policies (2 reports)** _. This research by Ove Arup aimed to develop a tool to assess the impact of future EU directives on national planning policies. Directives used in developing this tool included the Marine Strategy Directive, the Water Framework Directive and the Habitats Directive. It noted that EU Directives create significant tensions with the need for development to met demand. The Marine Strategy Directive would cost key business sectors between £439 million to £1.2 billion in additional costs. The research was commissioned in 2009 at a cost of £81,025.

### Building and the environment reports

> (vi) _ **Mapping the standard of existing stock and its turnover** _. This report by Building Research Establishment considered the work to develop a model of the existing housing stock in England and Wales, which could be used in assessing the impact of current and future policy in relation to energy use, carbon emissions and water consumption. This report was commissioned in 2008 at a cost of £56,305.
> 
> (vii) _ **Case studies of change of use of dwellings** _. This report by Faber Maunsell looked at achieving satisfactory acoustic performance for buildings to be converted from industry or commercial use to residential use. Although sound insulation was the main concern of this project, all other relevant requirements of the Building Regulations were to be considered and methods of compliance outlined. This report was commissioned in 2003 at a cost of £115,860.
> 
> (viii) _ **Lessons from Stamford Brook: Understanding the gap between designed and real performance** _. This report by Leeds Metropolitan University conveyed the results of a research designed to evaluate the extent to which low carbon housing standards could be achieved in a large commercial housing development and incorporated into future Building Regulations. The report was commissioned in 2002 and the department's contribution was £215,000.
> 
> (ix) _ **The safety of stairs investigated over a range of rise and goings** _. This report by Building Research Establishment considered people's use of stairs. It conducted analysis of subjective opinions, objective behaviour on stairs and foot placement data to establish the effect of guidance within Part K (Protection from falling, collision and impact) on the design of public, private and institutional stairs and the risk of falling. The report was commissioned in 2003 at a cost of £219,682.
> 
> (x) _ **Investigation of real fires** _. This report by the Building Research Establishment provided feedback on the performance of real buildings in real fires. The findings noted the overall effectiveness of the Building Regulations in providing for the safety of life in the event of fire and most of the significant issues that have been identified during this study fell outside the scope of these regulations. The report was commissioned in 2007 at a cost of £241,067.
> 
> (xi) _ **Modelling the current and potential accessibility of the housing stock** _. This report by Building Research Establishment considered the accessibility of the existing housing stock in England with particular reference to its utility for older and disabled people. The report uses data from the English Housing Condition Survey to identify the frequency and suitability of a range of built features within homes to arrive at an overall assessment of their accessibility and future adaptability. The report was commissioned in 2006 at a cost of £56,305.
> 
> (xii) ** _Future administration of the Energy Performance Buildings Directive Quality Assurance regime_ **. The objective of the work was to set the long term standards and quality assurance arrangements for the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (regime and infrastructure, including Accreditation Schemes (and energy assessors, to ensure that robust, repeatable and accurate Energy Performance Certificates, Display Energy Certificates and Air Conditioning Reports were produced in a consistent manner. It was commissioned in June 2009 at a cost of £75,280.
> 
> (xiii) ** _Review of the impact of the draft European Basic safety standard Directive on Building Regulations_ **. This report by the Building Research Establishment examines the implications of the proposed European ionising radiation Basic Safety Standard Directive for Building Regulations. This research was commissioned in February 2010 at a cost of £24,829.
> 
> (xiv) ** _Glazing under abnormal loads_ **. This report by Buro Happold and the Building Research Establishment addressed the issue of abnormal loads on glazing and the response of glazing systems. The research was commissioned in particular to examine the role of building regulations in mitigating the risks involved from abnormal loads on glazing. It reviewed structural assessment methods currently used to design buildings with glazed systems and assess their adequacy in the area of abnormal loadings. This work was commissioned in October 2003 at a cost of £157,052.
> 
> (xv) _ **Safety of Masonry Parapets** _. The overall aim of this project was to determine and analyse the most common structural problems associated with masonry parapets and the potential hazards and dangers that may arise. Having identified the problems, conclusions and recommendations require to be made regarding measures that ought to be taken in the specification, design, construction and maintenance of masonry parapets to ensure that they remained safe and structurally sound over the service life of the building. This work was commissioned in October 2003 and cost £61,212.
> 
> (xvi) _ **Radon: Current and Future Performance of Radon Protective Measures** _. This report by the Building Research Establishment (BRE) reviews the performance of radon protective measures in new buildings. The research notes that radon protection measures installed 20 years continue to provide a high degree of radon protection, and were not adversely affected by improvements such as extensions, conservatories, double glazing or insulation. This work was commissioned in February 2010 at a cost of £53,505.

These reports and findings are of general policy interest, but do not relate to forthcoming policy announcements and are not necessarily a reflection of the current Government's policies and priorities.

Copies of these reports are available on the Department for Communities and Local Government website. Copies have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/newsroom/2236805,Localising council tax support,"* * *

In the 2010 Spending Review, the Government announced plans to localise council tax benefit and this is being taken forward through the Local Government Finance Bill currently before Parliament. From April 2013, these reforms will localise council tax support and give councils stronger incentives to support local firms, cut fraud, promote local enterprise and get people back into work.

These reforms contribute to the Government's deficit reduction programme, delivering savings of £470million a year of taxpayers' money in Great Britain from 2013-14. Welfare reform is vital to tackle the budget deficit, as council tax benefit expenditure in England increased from £2.0billion to £4.3billion from 1997-98 by 2010-11.

Localisation will give local authorities the flexibility to design council tax support schemes for working age claimants in their area. We have been clear that councils have the scope to help manage the impact of the reduction in council tax support funding through securing sensible savings. To help the transition to these changes, my Department has already provided £30million of funding to help councils draw up local support schemes.

There is a real incentive for councils to make savings in the new localised system from cutting fraud and error, where an estimated £200 million was paid out unnecessarily in 2011-12. However, we appreciate that these savings may not be delivered immediately in the first year.

Consequently, to further assist the transition process, my Department is today announcing an additional £100million of funding for councils to help support them in developing well-designed council tax support schemes and maintain positive incentives to work. This is new and additional funding for local government.

As councils draw up their local schemes, it is clear that many are delivering savings using their local flexibilities and discretion, without unfairly increasing the burden on those who are currently on benefits. Equally, there are some councils which are asking for very large additional contributions from those on benefits.

The new £100million transition grant will seek to encourage best practice. The voluntary grant will be available to councils (billing and major precepting authorities) who choose to design their local schemes so that:

  * those who would be on 100 per cent support under current council tax benefit arrangements pay between zero and no more than 8.5 per cent of their council tax liability;
  * the taper rate does not increase above 25 per cent;
  * there is no sharp reduction in support for those entering work - for claimants currently entitled to less than 100 per cent support, the taper will be applied to an amount at least equal to their maximum eligible award.

In allowing flexibility over aspects of the scheme, we would not expect local authorities to impose large additional increases in non-dependant deductions. Councils will rightly want to avoid collecting small payments, and it may consequently be better value for money for councils to avoid designing schemes which seek to do so.

The amount of funding for which councils will be eligible to apply and the timescales and process for making an application will be published shortly. We anticipate that councils will make applications after 31 January 2013, and that funding will be paid in March 2013. The grant will be a simple one, easy to apply for and swiftly paid out, to help those councils who choose to do the right thing.

The Government has a clear goal in tackling the deficit, and reducing spending on benefits. This measured, transitional approach will help deliver an important programme of welfare reform, whilst still protecting taxpayers' broader interests.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/newsroom/firenationalframework,Fire and Rescue National Framework for England,"* * *

I have today published the Fire and Rescue National Framework for England. The Framework resets the relationship between fire and rescue authorities and Government. One of the key principles of which is to acknowledge the proficiency and experience of fire and rescue authorities; and to allow them the freedom and flexibility to deliver the services for which they are respected and renowned without Whitehall prescription.

The priorities in the Framework are for fire and rescue authorities to:

  * identify and assess the full range of foreseeable fire and rescue related risks their area faces, make provision for prevention and protection activities and to respond to incidents appropriately
  * work in partnership with their communities and a wide range of partners locally and nationally to deliver their service; and
  * be accountable to communities for the service they provide.

Fire and rescue authorities face new challenges: the need to deal with the continuing threat of terrorism, the impact of climate change, and the impacts of an ageing population, against a backdrop of change and the need to cut the national deficit. The Framework enables fire and rescue authorities to efficiently deliver their services; including working collaboratively with other fire and rescue authorities, or with other organisations, to improve public safety and cost effectiveness. Principally, it is to local communities, not central government, that fire and rescue authorities are accountable.

The Framework delivers on the Government commitment in its response to the Fire Future Reports, to clearly define national resilience and to set out clear roles and responsibilities in relation to national resilience. The Framework also sets out arrangements for fire and rescue authorities to collectively engage with Government on national resilience issues through a new Fire and Rescue Strategic Resilience Board. Through this Board, we will take a collaborative approach to national resilience that is based on and drawn from local capability, expertise, knowledge and leadership.

The Framework has an open-ended duration which gives fire and rescue authorities greater certainty. The high level, strategic nature of the Framework should mean that it will remain unchanged for the medium to long term.

Copies of the Fire and Rescue National Framework for England have been deposited in the Library of the House.

On 9 February I reported to the House on the Heads of Agreement on the firefighters' pension scheme to be introduced in 2015, which set out the Government's final position on the main elements of scheme design. My officials have continued discussions with the firefighter unions and the Local Government Association over the remaining details of the firefighters' pension scheme.  
  
The Government pays tribute to the importance of the work undertaken by our fire and rescue service and the bravery, dedication and professionalism of the men and women who work within it. The Government is committed to providing public service pensions that are sustainable, fair and effective.  
  
Building on the proposals brought forward by Lord Hutton, the proposed final agreement aims to strike a balanced deal between public service workers and the taxpayer. They will ensure that public service workers continue to have access to good pensions, while taxpayers benefit from greater control over their costs.  
  
Public sector pensions will remain among the very best available - a guaranteed level and inflation proofed. Only 1 in 10 private sector workers have access to such schemes.

I can now report to the House that discussions on the design parameters for the firefighters' pension scheme in England to be introduced in 2015 have been concluded. This sets out our final position on proposed scheme design, which we are asking unions to take to their Executives as the outcome of negotiations.  
  
The headline elements of the proposed final agreement are set out below. The Government intends to maintain constructive dialogue with the fire fighter unions and the Local Government Association as detailed work goes forward.  
  
There will be full statutory protections provided in the new Scheme for the accrued rights of existing Scheme members:

  * all benefits accrued under final salary arrangements will be linked to the members' final salary, in accordance with the rules of the members' current schemes, when they leave the reformed scheme
  * full recognition of a member's expectation to double accrual for service accrued under the Firefighters' Pension Scheme 1992 ('the 1992 scheme'), so that a member's full continuous pensionable service upon retirement will be used to calculate an averaged accrual rate to be applied to service accrued under the 1992 scheme
  * members to be able to access their 1992 scheme benefits when they retire at that scheme's 'ordinary pension' age (i.e. from age 50 with 25 or more years pensionable service), subject to abatement rules for that scheme. Pensionable service for the purpose of calculating the ordinary pension age will include any continuous pensionable service accrued under both the 1992 scheme and the 2015 scheme
  * members of the 1992 scheme will continue to have access to an actuarially assessed commutation factor for benefits accrued under that scheme

There also will be transitional statutory protections for qualifying, existing members:

  * all active scheme members who, as of 1 April 2012, have 10 years or less to their current Normal Pension Age will see no change in when they can retire, nor any decrease in the amount of pension they receive at their current Normal Pension Age. This protection will be achieved by the member remaining in their current scheme until they retire, which could be beyond 31 March 2022.
  * there will be a further 4 years of tapered protection for scheme members. Members who are up to 14 years from their current Normal Pension Age, as of 1 April 2012, will have limited protection so that on average for every month of age they are beyond 10 years of their Normal Pension Age, they gain about 53 days of protection. The last day of protected service for any member will be 31 March 2022.

The core parameters of the new Scheme are set out below:

> a. a pension scheme design based on career average revalued earnings
> 
> b. an accrual rate of 1/58.7th of pensionable earnings each year
> 
> c. there will be no cap on how much pension can be accrued
> 
> d. a revaluation rate of active members' benefits in line with average weekly earnings
> 
> e. pensions in payment and deferred benefits to increase in line with Prices Index (currently CPI)
> 
> f. Member contribution rates in the 2015 scheme from 1 April 2015 will average 13.2 per cent, equal to the expected average of contribution rates in the 1992 and 2006 schemes on the 31 March 2015. However, as announced by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury on 20 December 2011, the Government will review the impact of the proposed 2012-13 contribution changes, including the effect of membership opt-outs, before taking final decisions on how future increases will be delivered in 2013-14 and 2014-15, and in the new scheme. Interested parties will have a full opportunity to provide evidence and their views to the Government as part of the review
> 
> g. without prejudice to the outcome of that review, tariffs for the 2015 scheme are likely to provide for lower rates for new recruits, with some tiered progressive increases for middle, high, and higher income earners
> 
> h. flexible retirement from the scheme's minimum pension age of 55, built around the scheme's Normal Pension Age of 60, with members able to take their pension from the scheme's minimum pension age, as follows:
> 
> - for all active members who are aged 57 or more at retirement, 2015 scheme benefits taken before Normal Pension Age will be actuarially reduced with reference to the 2015 scheme's Normal Pension Age, rather than the deferred pension age  
- all other members will have their 2015 scheme benefits actuarially reduced on a cost neutral basis from the scheme's deferred pension age.
> 
> i. authority initiated early retirement for members of the 2015 scheme, from age 55, to be in accordance with the arrangements set out in Part 3, Rule 6 of the New Firefighters' Pension Scheme 2006
> 
> j. the Normal Pension Age will be subject to regular review. These reviews will consider the increasing State Pension Age and any changes to it, alongside evidence from interested parties, including unions and employers. It will consider if the Normal Pension Age of 60 remains relevant, taking account of the economical, efficient and effective management of the fire service, the changing profile of the workforce and the occupational demands of, and fitness standards for, firefighting roles
> 
> k. this regular review will be informed by research to be carried out, within the auspices of the Firefighters' Pension Committee, which will monitor and collate scheme data and experience
> 
> l. late retirement factors for members retiring from active service to be actuarially neutral from Normal Pension Age
> 
> m. a deferred pension age equal to the individuals' State Pension Age
> 
> n. an optional lump sum by commutation at a rate of £12 for every £1 per annum of pension foregone in accordance with HM Revenue and Customs limits and regulations
> 
> o. abatement in existing schemes to continue
> 
> p. ill-health retirement benefits to be based on the arrangements in the 2006 scheme
> 
> q. all other ancillary benefits to be based on those contained in the 2006 scheme
> 
> r. members rejoining after a period of deferment of less than 5 years can link new service with previous service, as if they had always been an active member
> 
> s. members transferring between public service schemes would be treated as having continuous active service
> 
> t. an employer contribution cap with a symmetrical buffer.

The scheme actuary has confirmed that this scheme design does not exceed the cost ceiling set by the Government on 2 November. Copies of the proposed final agreement and scheme actuary verification have been deposited in the Libraries of both Houses.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/newsroom/6436205,Business Rates,"* * *

I am today announcing the Government's intention to postpone the next business rates revaluation in England to 2017. Primary legislation will be brought forward through the Growth and Infrastructure Bill which will shortly be laid before Parliament.

Business rates are the third biggest outgoing for local firms after rent and staff costs. This decision will avoid local firms and local shops facing unexpected hikes in their business rate bills over the next five years. As business rates are linked to inflation, there will be no real terms increase in rates over this period. This reform will provide certainty for business to plan and invest, supporting local economic growth.

Since the last revaluation (based on 2008 valuations), the economy and property market have faced exceptional changes. A revaluation at this point would be likely to result in sharp changes to business rate bills in many parts of the country and in many sectors. Tax stability is vital to businesses looking to grow and help improve the economy.

The Government is committed to maintaining up to date rate bills through regular five yearly revaluations in England which will resume after 2017, once the economy has had a chance to recover fully from the financial and fiscal crisis this Government inherited from the last Administration.

These measures complement the local retention of business rates being introduced through the Local Government Finance Bill which will give councils new incentives to support local firms and local shops, and also complements the new power to introduce local business rate discounts, the automation of small business rate relief and the abolition of the unfair 'ports tax' all enacted through the Localism Act 2011.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/newsroom/august2011riots,August 2011 riots,"* * *

I am grateful to Darra Singh and the other members of the Riots, Communities and Victims Panel for their work on their independent review into last year's public disorder. They have presented us with a substantial report that seeks to identify steps that can be taken to strengthen social and economic resilience in the aftermath of last August's riots. We value the importance of the Panel's work and will publish further information on the Government response to the Panel's report in due course.

### Riots recovery

On 12 August 2011, as part of a concerted, cross-Government action, the Government announced a series of measures to help rebuild communities following the riots and public disorder in the summer of 2011.

The package provided immediate and ongoing support to open up shops and rebuild buildings which were damaged, make sure people who lost their homes were re-housed, and to help councils get their areas back to normal as quickly as possible.

Under these schemes, local councils played a pivotal role in providing support to local firms and local residents, with central Government reimbursing their costs. I would like to put on the record the thanks of Her Majesty's Government for the work of local government in giving clear and determined leadership to their communities.

The Department for Communities and Local Government reimbursed councils' immediate costs of around £10 million to make their areas safe, clear and clean again and to help councils reduce business rates, finance emergency building repairs and encourage customers back to affected areas. It also reimbursed councils for potential losses from New Homes Bonus payments as well as for immediate costs of just under £400,000 to re-house those made homeless by the public disorder.

We also recognise the leadership shown by the Mayor of London and local authorities across the country in driving recovery in their areas. Their leadership helped galvanise the community and brought people together to reclaim and rebuild their neighbourhoods. Salford celebrated local pride by launching an 'I love Salford' campaign as an act of defiance against the looters. Manchester made sure people understood what help was on offer by knocking on doors and helping to complete forms. The Mayor provided immediate advice to those affected through a dedicated website and helpline as well as supporting the charitable High Street Fund. The Mayor has also created a Regeneration Fund to create jobs and economic growth in the worst affected areas. 

Local authorities also provided their own funding or facilitated access to other funding. For example, the Croydon Enterprise Loan Fund provided interest free loans up to £10,000 to affected businesses and the Tottenham Fund in Haringey raised around £50,000 and received donations of clothes and goods for displaced families. Councils such as Ealing started making emergency payments to businesses within a week of the disorder working swiftly to overcome bureaucracy.

Government played its part, but communities themselves led the way and got on with the job of repairing the damage. We saw some remarkable examples of kindness - people coming together and giving their time and energy to cleaning up streets in the mornings after the disturbances, helping victims through donations of money and goods and affirming their pride in the places they live and work.

### Riots damages and insurance

Separate to these actions, residents could potentially also claim back costs from their insurers and/or police authorities.

The vast majority of individuals and businesses who suffered losses as a result of the riots last August have received a payout. Police authorities have concluded 95 per cent of all valid active uninsured claims made under the Riot (Damages) Act. Of those who have insurance approximately 95 per cent of individuals and 92 per cent of small to medium size businesses have received a payout from their insurer. There are also a number of claims to be settled by police authorities who are seeking reimbursement of costs they have paid to policy holders, so far 81 per cent of these cases have been dealt with. The majority of cases that are still outstanding in police authorities are being delayed as a result of required information that has not been sent by the claimants or insurance companies.

While every effort has been made to support and compensate victims, we are reviewing the Riot (Damages) Act to ensure that it is fit for a modern policing world.

### Policing reform

The scenes of disorder last year were unprecedented in modern times and we are working with the police to take forward recommendations of Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary's report, _The Rules of Engagement: A Review of the August 2011 disorders_. Significant progress has been made, including ongoing development of information and intelligence gathering; testing of swifter mobilisation capabilities; and, consideration and enhancement of the broad range of tactical responses required for policing disorder. Reform is an ongoing process and the work underway will help ensure the police maintain the sharpness to respond effectively each and every time.

The Panel's report also notes the need to improve engagement between the police and local communities. We know the public want a permanent and visible police presence in their communities, working alongside them to identify and tackle the issues that matter to them. The police should work openly and in partnership with all members of their community. From November, Police and Crime Commissioners will be responsible for ensuring that local people's voices are heard and acted upon and make sure that the police are delivering the priorities of the local community.

### Social policy review

Alongside responsible steps to strengthen our capabilities to deal with any future disturbances should they arise, Government is taking forward action to address some of the more entrenched issues highlighted in the Panel's report. We have conducted a review of social policy which has built upon existing programmes of work that were in place to address some of these issues, such as enhancing the support provided to parents. 

The importance of early intervention and good parenting was brought out strongly in the Panel's report. We know that the experiences children are exposed to in the very early years and before birth - social, economic, psychological and environmental - affect their health, wellbeing and outcomes in later life. The Government is increasing the number of health visitors by 4,200 and, for some of the most vulnerable families, doubling the number of places on the Family Nurse Partnership programme by 2015.

To support good parenting from the start, the Government is also retaining a network of Sure Start Children's Centres accessible to all families and focussing support on those who need it most. Evidence shows that universal stigma free services can play a crucial role in reaching the most vulnerable families as well as helping to improve outcomes for children. We are also trialling providing access to universal high quality parenting classes to mothers and fathers of young children.

We gave local councils much greater flexibility over how they use their funding, to enable them to work with local partners to prevent families reaching crisis points. In addition we have provided up to £11 million of funding over 2011-13 to the voluntary and community sector to deliver national online and telephone support services, including specialist support to help parents when they need it in dealing with a wide range of issues including relationship advice and dealing with children with behaviour problems.

Alongside expanding existing areas of work, the social policy review has led to the development of a further programme of action aimed at reducing crime and re-offending; supporting families and parents; welfare and work; supporting young people; and accelerating regeneration in our cities.

### Troubled Families initiative

The Troubled Families programme is targeting those families that would benefit most from help to turn their life around. Troubled families include those with adults out of work, children not in school and families who are committing anti-social behaviour and crime. Through tackling the root causes underlying a family's problems the programme will turn around the lives of 120,000 families by getting parents into work and children attending school. All 152 eligible councils have confirmed that they are ready and willing to run the programme in their area and are now well in to drawing up their lists of families so that help can get in there quickly. The programme is focusing on the most difficult families, but it will also help drive effective support to a wider number of families who are struggling but who are not the most disruptive or chaotic.

As well as addressing the family's needs, we are taking action to improve young people's life chances through a number of wide ranging reforms aimed at raising the educational attainment of disadvantaged pupils. These reforms include the Pupil Premium, the Academy and Free schools programme and strengthening teacher's powers to tackle bad behaviour in schools.

### Tackling gang and youth violence

We know that a significant proportion of young people involved in the disturbances had links with gangs. The cross-Government _Ending Gang and Youth Violence_ report, published in November 2011, contains a series of actions for central government and a set of principles and good practice examples to help local areas tackle the problem. Implementation of the report commitments is underway, including the provision of expert support to 29 areas most affected by gang and youth violence.

### Training and employment

We recognise that a successful passage to adulthood is best served by work. As the Panel's report highlights, we need to make sure that young people have the skills they need to get ready for work. That is why we are overhauling vocational education and have created the biggest apprenticeships programme our country has ever seen. We are determined to bring down the number of young people who are not in education, employment or training through making continuing in education and training to 18 compulsory and supporting those most in need via the Youth Contract which will provide additional support worth almost £1 billion, to young people over the next three years. As part of the Contract 160,000 wage incentives worth up to £2,275 each are now available to employers who recruit an 18-24 year-old from the Work Programme for at least 26 weeks. From late July 2012, in selected 'youth unemployment hotspots', wage incentives will be available via Jobcentre Plus to employ 18-24 year olds who have been claiming for 6 months.

### Effective justice

The Panel's report highlighted the number of rioters with a large number of previous criminal convictions. Last year, the Government published innovative plans to reform how we punish, sentence and rehabilitate offenders. We are already taking active steps to strengthen community sentences to stop less serious offenders getting to the stage where custody is necessary, with more intensive community payback, longer electronically monitored curfews and bans on driving and foreign travel. But we want to go further and have just consulted on proposals which include a clear punitive element in every community order handed down by the courts. In addition, since March 2012 all prison leavers that claim Jobseekers' Allowance will be mandated immediately onto the Work Programme. We are committed to improving the speed and efficiency of the criminal justice system, building on lessons learned from the swift response to the riots, and are setting out the work we are taking forward in the White Paper: _Swift and Sure Justice: the Government's Plans for Reform of the Criminal Justice System_, published today.

Alongside this we are taking forward policies to start tackling the high number of repeat offenders. We are making prison places of meaningful productive work and training where more prisoners are expected to work a full week and we are testing drug recovery wings which aim to get offenders off drugs for good. We are also implementing Payment by Results pilots, which will pay providers according to their success in reducing re-offending rates.

We are committed to legislating to extend landlords' powers to seek possession where a tenant or member of their household is convicted of an offence committed at the scene of a riot.

### Punishing criminals

The acts of selfless kindness shown by many, contrast starkly with those who robbed and looted, acting as a reminder that the riots were perpetrated by a reckless minority.

Government has sent a strong message to those that took part in the riots that acts of mindless criminality will not be tolerated. Those involved have been brought swiftly to justice. As of June 2012, 1,968 people were found guilty and sentenced. 1,292 people received immediate custody and their average sentence length was over four times longer than the average sentence for similar crimes in 2010 (based on those found guilty at the magistrates' court but sentenced at any court). Those sentenced to immediate custody were given an average custodial sentence length of 16.8 months. This compares to an average custodial sentence length of 3.7 months for those convicted at magistrates' courts, but sentenced at any court for similar offences in England and Wales in 2010.

Through these actions and the programme of work outlined in this response, we are confident that we are building strong foundations to address the issues raised in the Panel's report.

But there is one clear overriding message: the rioters were criminals. Such opportunistic criminality was not and will not be tolerated.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/newsroom/2180483,"Unpublished research reports: Building, planning and the environment","* * *

Today the Government is publishing a group of reports presenting the findings from research projects commissioned by the previous administration.

We are publishing these documents in the interests of transparency and as part of our Freedom of Information commitment to publish the results of all commissioned research. For transparency, all completed work is being published regardless of format or robustness.

The [seven reports](http://www.communities.gov.uk/archived/general-content/corporate/researcharchive/volume12building/) published today represent the findings from seven research projects at a total cost of £190,320. These findings cover the topics of building, planning and the environment.

This research provides an improved evidence base to understand the costs, benefits and practical implications of applying the Lifetime Home Standard to new build housing development. In particular it develops cost analysis which more accurately reflects the likely contribution of access standards to the cumulative impact of regulation on housing supply, and sets out clearly the likely impact on different housing typologies, and on site density.

Although these reports are from the last Administration, they do touch upon current government policy. The Coalition Government has set out in the National Planning Policy Framework that Local Plans must take into account the housing needs of a range of users including older and disabled people. In November's Housing Strategy, this Government also set out its expectation that new development should have a diverse mix of property types, including more accessible designs such as the Lifetime Home Standard. However, we do not intend to introduce national regulation. We believe that decisions should be made at a local level, in proportion to local need and aligned with other local housing support and information services.

### Lifetime Homes Standards

> (i) ** _Modelling the current and potential accessibility of the housing stock_ ** - This report by Building Research Establishment considers the accessibility of the existing housing stock in England with particular reference to its utility for older and disabled people. The report uses data from the English Home Condition Survey to identify the frequency and suitability of a range of built features within homes to arrive at an overall assessment of their accessibility and future adaptability. The report was commissioned in 2006 at a cost of £56,305.
> 
> (ii) _ **Assessing the cost of Lifetime Homes Standards** _ - This report by the Building Cost Information Service (BCIS) looks at establishing the cost impact of introducing the Lifetime Homes Standards in private sector housing, identifying best practice and the potential cost savings that can be delivered through efficiency of design. The report was commissioned in 2009 at a cost of £34,818.
> 
> (iii) ** _Health benefits of Lifetime Home Standards_ ** - This report by the Building Research Establishment sets out findings from work to determine the relative benefits of building to the Lifetime Home Standard. Utilising existing data from the Housing Health and Safety Rating System, the research evaluated the health costs associated with the different levels of harm relating either to direct NHS costs or to societal costs. The report was commissioned in 2009 at a cost of £21,302.
> 
> (iv) ** _Lifetime Homes: Technical forum_ ** - This report by Habinteg Housing Association captures discussions and recommendations which emerged from a Technical Working Group established to test proposals for improving guidance in the Lifetime Home Standard. This report was commissioned in 2009 at a cost of £17,448.
> 
> (v) ** _Analysis of distribution of housing typologies in Public and Private Sector and typical compatibility with the Lifetime Home Standard_ ** - This research conducted by Levitt Bernstein considers the impact of and current compliance with the 16 point standard of _Lifetime Homes Lifetime Neighbourhoods - a National strategy for Housing in an Ageing Society_. Mindful that the standards were originally developed with very suburban 2, 3 and 4 bed detached housing in mind, there was a need to review the 16 point standard and consider the implications of applying it to current and emerging new build housing typologies in England and Wales. The research develops and agrees a model of the variety and distribution of future housing typologies in England and Wales and analyses what impact the application of Lifetime Homes Standards will have on varying house typologies. The study focussed primarily on private sector housing. This report was commissioned in 2009 at a cost of £34,360.
> 
> (vi) ** _Impact on site density of Lifetime Homes_ ** - This research work conducted by Levitt Bernstein is an extension to an earlier piece of work and represents an initial exploration of the impact that the application of Lifetime Homes Standards is likely to have on the site density of private sector housing. It concentrates on low to medium density suburban developments, typically 30-60 dwellings per hectare (dph). The research consisted of a theoretical analysis to calculate the effect on plot size of various increases to plan footprints; an assessment of impact on density on a small sample of typical site layouts in addition to feed back from industry about site density and marketability. This report was commissioned in 2009 at a cost of £16,087.
> 
> (vii) _ **Design of Lifetime homes** _ - This research conducted by Hunt Thomson Architects seeks to evaluate the impact on designing private sectors homes to meet the Lifetime Home Standard, and in particular to understand the likely impact of seeking to minimise both increase in cost and any necessary increase in the overall size of properties by adopting the standard. The project utilised analysis of a range of typical speculative housing development plans and compares these designs with entirely new housing layouts which incorporate the 16 elements of the Lifetime Home Standard. This report was commissioned in 2009 at a cost of £10,000.

At a time when public budgets must be reduced, the new Government wants to ensure its research delivers best possible value for money for the taxpayer and that sums expended are reasonable in relation to the public policy benefits obtained. My department has put in place new scrutiny and challenge processes for future research.

Any new projects will be scrutinised to ensure the methodology is sound and that all options for funding are explored at an early stage. This includes using existing work from other organisations, joint funding projects with other departments or organisations and taking work forward in-house.

Copies of these reports are available on the Department for Communities and Local Government [website](http://www.communities.gov.uk/archived/general-content/corporate/researcharchive/volume12building/). Copies have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/newsroom/2189479,Abolition of Regional Strategies,"* * *

It is the Government's policy to revoke existing regional strategies outside London, reflecting manifesto commitments made by both Coalition parties in the 2010 general election and subsequently incorporated into the Coalition Agreement. The Localism Act 2011 provides for the abolition of regional strategies in a two-stage process. The first stage, to remove the regional planning framework and prevent further strategies from being created, took effect when the Localism Act received Royal Assent on 15 November. The second stage would be to abolish the existing regional strategies by secondary legislation. However, any final decision on this must take account of assessments of, and consultation on, the possible environmental effects of revocation of each of the existing regional strategies.

The Strategic Environmental Assessment process is set out in an EU Directive (Directive 2001/42/EC). In March 2012, the European Court of Justice issued a significant ruling on the interpretation and application of the Directive (Inter-Environnement Bruxelles ASBL & Others v Government of the Brussels-Capital Region).

As part of the Strategic Environmental Assessment process, and before the decision of the European Court of Justice, there has already been consultation with the statutory consultation bodies on the scope and level of detail of the environmental reports. Public consultation took place between October 2011 and January 2012 on the basis of environmental reports published in October 2011. Detailed responses were provided in the course of this exercise.  
   
Following the decision of the European Court of Justice, in the light of planning policy and legislation that have been put in place since January 2012, in light of the earlier consultation responses, and in order to be meticulous in observing the requirements of the Directive, the Government is now updating the environmental reports and undertaking additional consultation. We are publishing the first of the updated environmental reports: the report in respect of the proposed [revocation of the East of England Regional Strategy](http://www.communities.gov.uk/planningandbuilding/planningenvironment/strategicenvironmentassess/) shortly and will place a copy in the Libraries of both Houses. This report builds on and is intended to supersede the previous report.

The period for consultation responses will remain open for eight weeks. We welcome and encourage all interested parties to respond. At the end of that period we will consider all consultation responses, including those already submitted during the October 2011 to January 2012 response period.

In the coming weeks my Department will publish updated environmental reports relating to the proposals on each of the other regional strategies, so that those proposals too can be the subject of additional consultation. In each case there will be an 8 week period for consultation responses. All updated environmental reports will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses as they are published.

The proposed revocation of the Regional Strategies may be regarded as a material consideration by decision makers when determining planning applications and appeals.

In respect of plan-making, the National Planning Policy Framework implementation period provides councils with the incentive to get their plan policies up to date and in doing so they can have regard to the policy to revoke Regional Strategies and the new National Planning Policy Framework policies. A local plan document must be in general conformity with the regional strategy at the stage that the plan is submitted for examination but it is open to councils when preparing local plans to take account of the policy to revoke up to the time of submission. Local authorities can also bring forward proposals (for example on housing targets) which have a local interpretation to them in their plans, based on their own sound evidence base where that is justified by the local circumstances. That evidence base is likely to be more up to date than that included in the Regional Strategies. Each case will depend on its particular facts.

Today the Government is publishing the eleventh group of reports presenting the findings from research projects commissioned by the previous administration.

There is a significant backlog of unpublished reports that were produced by the previous government which we will be publishing in groups themed on a particular topic.

The reports and findings are of general policy interest, but do not relate to forthcoming policy announcements. We are publishing these documents in the interests of transparency and as part of our Freedom of Information commitment to publish the results of all commissioned research.

The [20 reports](http://www.communities.gov.uk/archived/general-content/corporate/researcharchive/volume11fire/) listed below represent the findings from seventeen research projects at a total cost to taxpayers of £1,042,850. These findings cover the topic of fire.

> (i) _ **Review of the adequacy and impact of integrated risk management planning in the fire and rescue service** _. This report, commissioned in 2008, evaluated the adequacy and overall impact of integrated risk management planning on the efficiency of the fire and rescue service and on national fire-related outcomes.
> 
> (ii) _ **Asset management in fire and rescue authorities** _. This report evaluated the extent to which fire and rescue authorities manage their property assets to ensure effective service provision and achieve value for money, and to make recommendations for improvement.
> 
> (iii) _ **A review of current processes for operational training and development in the fire and rescue service** _. The review was set up to provide part of the evidence base needed to inform the debate about fire and rescue service operational training and development. The project was also to identify good practice for wider dissemination and look for opportunities to improve and strength training for the future.
> 
> (iv) _ **Effectiveness of operational intervention - Gap analysis paper** _. This report by Qinetiq Limited identified gaps in the evidence base that may need to be filled in order to develop a computer model to simulate fire fighting operations. The report makes suggestions for how these gaps could be filled.
> 
> (v) _ **Effectiveness of operational intervention - Model development paper** _. This paper documented the development of a trial computer model to investigate the effectiveness of operational intervention at fire fighting incidents.
> 
> (vi) _ **Effectiveness of sprinklers in housing, commercial, public and other buildings** _. This research was commissioned in response to concerns and pressure from the sector that the provision of sprinklers represents the most cost effective way to maintain the downward pressure on fire deaths and associated economic losses.
> 
> (vii) ** _Impact of the fire fighter awareness campaign_ **. The fire and rescue service has struggled to recruit women for operational fire fighter roles. At the time of the study women made up less than 3% of the fire and rescue service's operational workforce. Research has shown that one of the key reasons why women are not becoming fire fighters is the service's image and the lack of awareness of fire fighting as a career for women.

_Draft text of the statement - may differ from the delivered version._

With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a statement on housing and planning.

  * The Coalition Government inherited a legacy where house building had fallen to its lowest rates since the 1920s.
  * A top-down planning system that built nothing but resentment.
  * A regime of regional planning quangos that created paralysis and confrontation. After six years of preparation, by the general election, less than 60 councils had completed local plans.

The result was no development. No regeneration. No community benefits.

This Government wants to get the economy growing.

To remove unnecessary red tape.

To support locally-led sustainable development.

In November, the Government published a comprehensive [housing strategy](http://www.communities.gov.uk/housing/about/keymeasures/) to support a thriving, active and stable housing market.

In March, we published a [National Planning Policy Framework](http://www.communities.gov.uk/planningandbuilding/planningsystem/planningpolicy/planningpolicyframework/) to condense 1,000 pages of central planning guidance to just 50.

Housebuilding is up - 29 per cent higher in 2011 than in 2009. But there is more to do.

So today, my Department is announcing a further series of common sense measures to promote house building and support locally-led economic growth.

The technical details are laid out in a [Written Statement](http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/newsroom/2211838) which has been laid before the House. I will summarise the key points for Hon Members.

  * Following on from [Sir Adrian Montague's independent report](http://www.communities.gov.uk/housing/privaterentedhousing/investment/) on supporting the private rented sector, we are providing £200 million of new funding to support institutional investment in high-quality rented homes.
  * Thanks to the action we have taken to tackle the last Government's deficit, we are passing on the lower costs of borrowing. We will be issuing a debt guarantee for up to £10 billion to support private investment in the private rented sector and in new affordable housing.
  * We will support up to an additional 15,000 affordable homes through the use of loan guarantees, flexibilities and capital funding.
  * We also intend to extend our successful refurbishment programme to bring an additional 5,000 existing empty homes back into use. The last Government wanted to demolish Victorian terraces with John Prescott's Pathfinder programme. By contrast, we are getting homes back into productive use.
  * In total we will invest another £300m in these measures to support new affordable homes and bring empty homes into use.
  * We actively want to support home ownership, which fell under the last Parliament despite a Labour pledge to increase it by a million.  
We are extending our successful FirstBuy scheme for first time buyers, with an additional £280 million of funding, helping up to 16,500 additional first time buyers to purchase a home.
  * To free up more brownfield land for development and regeneration, we will accelerate the release of surplus public sector land and empty offices through a targeted programme of transfers from other Government bodies.
  * We will work with local authorities and developers to unlock locally-supported large sites. Just last week, we were back to unblock the Eastern Quarry in the Ebbsfleet Valley - a major ex-industrial sitethat had stalled for a decade.

We are working with local communities and councils. But some councils need to raise their game, by failing to make planning decisions in a timely way. Planning delays create uncertainty both for local residents and local firms. So we will introduce a series of practical measures to help speed up planning decisions and appeals, and major infrastructure.

Some complex developments take time to assemble. So we are allowing for developers to extend the duration of existing planning permissions.

We are making it easier for developers to change unrealistic Section 106 agreements. A development which isn't built means no Section 106 payments. Common sense reforms will result in more regeneration, more housing and more community benefits.

Sustainable development should go hand in hand with environmental safeguards.

I can confirm that we have protected the Green Belt, in line with our commitment in the Coalition Agreement.

It has always the case that councils can amend local Green Belt boundaries should they wish - and we will support councils which choose to. This can include introducing new Green Belt protection around new large developments.

There is considerable previously developed land in many Green Belt areas. We encourage councils to make best use of this land, whilst protecting the openness of the Green Belt in line with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework.

If we are to protect our countryside, we need to focus more growth in our town centres. So we are introducing measures to make it easier to turn empty commercial buildings into housing. Our high streets will benefit from a greater resident population, increasing footfall and supporting local shops.

As a nation, we have great pride in our homes. We want to make it easier for families to undertake home improvements - such as building a new conservatory. So we will be seeking to simplify and increase permitted development rights for householders. Cutting back municipal red tape in this way could provide a particular boost for small traders and small builders.

Mr Speaker, These practical measures build on the housing, local government finance and planning reforms already in play.

Giving more power to individuals, to communities, to councils.

Providing new incentives to support local shops, local firms and local economic growth.

Delivering sustainable development and getting Britain building.

I commend this statement to the House.
