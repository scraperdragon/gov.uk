"The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore has said Scotland will benefit from the UK Government's latest food and drink export initiative launched today (Friday 27 January).

The Minister said Defra's Food and Drink Export Action Plan would set out how government and industry would work together to open up new key markets, including a plan to encourage and support manufacturers exporting overseas and a campaign to champion UK food abroad.

Defra worked with UKTI, industry trade associations and exporting companies to produce the plans in order to boost food and drink exports to high growth markets like India and China.

The Scotch Whisky Association has welcomed the initiative, saying it would create a ""joined-up approach to market access"" and increase the focus on removing trade barriers.

Michael Moore, who recently led the largest ever Scottish trade mission to Brazil, said:

""Scotland's food and drink is known across the world for its quality and this UK Government initiative will help support our companies as they further develop their business with the rest of the world. We have been working hard to secure further footholds in emerging markets, including securing geographical indication protection for Scotch whisky. This action plan will help exporters make the most of the huge global opportunities available to Scottish companies and will, in turn, help create and secure jobs and boost our economy.""

The project steering group which developed the action plan along with the export forum included Defra, UKTI, Food and Drink Federation, Food and Drink Exporters Association, Scotch Whisky Association, and the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board.

The Exports Action Plan includes plans to:

-       Hold regional road shows and business-to-business networking events to share best practice and encourage companies to export;

-       Make it far easier for companies to access the range of advice and support already available;

-       Make food export paperwork simpler and easier to access;

-       Better advertise the financial safeguards available to protect smaller companies from not being paid, which is a key concern;

-       Work across government and industry to get other countries to remove bans on British meat, such as beef and lamb to China.

-       Support inexperienced agri-food companies to showcase products at international tradeshows and trade missions;

-       Ministers and a new international business ambassador to provide high-level support and promote the best of British produce abroad;

-       Showcase British food and drink at the London Olympics 2012 to attract international buyers.

"Unemployment in Scotland rose by 19,000, to 231,000 in the period September to November 2011, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) data released today. The Scottish unemployment rate is 8.6 per cent, above the UK average of 8.4 per cent.

The labour market statistics also show employment in Scotland has decreased by 8,000 over the three months to September - November 2011. The number of those in employment in Scotland now stands at 2,467,000.

In December 2011, the number of people out of work and claiming Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) was 140,900. This is a fall of 1,400 over the month and the fourth consecutive monthly fall.

The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore said:

 ""There can be no clearer signal we need to focus on getting the economy back to health than the rise in unemployment shown by these figures. We have to get Scotland back to work and it is imperative we keep making the right decisions to support and grow our economy. Restoring confidence and stability will require work across every sector and I will continue to meet with a wide variety of businesses and organisations in the coming weeks and months.

""Tackling youth unemployment continues to be a major focus and I will chair a major national event on the issue in March to build on the seminars held throughout Scotland over the last year. We are taking major practical steps through the UK Government's Youth Contract, a £1 billion initiative backed by business and aimed directly at helping the young unemployed into work.

""There is no doubt it will take the committed efforts of both of Scotland's governments to overcome the scourge of joblessness among our young people and I will work with the Scottish Government, agencies, civic Scotland and anyone else to get people back into jobs.

""There has been a lot of interest in the constitution and the uncertainty surrounding Scotland's future in the last few days but Scotland should know nothing will divert this government from  the challenges we face in creating long-term, sustainable jobs.""

"Lord Wallace of Tankerness QC, the Advocate General for Scotland, has today said the Scottish  Government's forthcoming consultation paper cannot conceivably produce a solution to the legal problem which prevents Holyrood holding an independence referendum.

Lord Wallace reiterated the UK Government's legal view that the Scottish Parliament has no power to legislate for a referendum on independence and said it would make a great deal of sense for the First Minister and the Scottish Secretary to meet so that they can clear the path to a legal, fair and decisive referendum for the Scottish people.

The Advocate General said that any attempt by the Scottish Government to proceed with a referendum which is outside the Rule of Law would be ""a very worrying step for a democratically elected government to take"".

Lord Wallace will  give a lecture at Glasgow University on 20 January on Scotland's constitutional future. Speaking ahead of that lecture Lord Wallace commented on the UK Government's plans to facilitate a referendum on Scottish independence.

Lord Wallace said:

 ""Let me be clear. The Government wishes the referendum to take place on a sound legal basis, thus avoiding court challenge. The Government has therefore proposed a solution that involves devolving power to the Scottish Parliament that would avoid a referendum bill being dragged through the courts.  It would make a great deal of sense for the First Minister and the Scottish Secretary to meet so that they can start clearing the path to a legal, fair and decisive referendum for the Scottish people. There is no reason to delay these talks while we await  the Scottish Government's own consultation paper because there is nothing that could conceivably be in that document that will alter the legal position we face.

""The UK Government's legal view is that the Scottish Parliament has no power to deliver a referendum on independence. It does not matter whether such a referendum is described as ""advisory"", ""consultative"" or providing a basis for negotiations.  The Scottish Parliament has no power to legislate for a referendum on independence. 

""There are important consequences which follow from this.  One is that to proceed with a referendum that is outside of its legal powers would be to act contrary to the Rule of Law.  This is not a mere legal technicality as some commentators have suggested.  Government according to law is a fundamental principle of democracy.  To flout this principle would be a very worrying step for a democratically elected government to take.

""The second is that Scottish Parliament legislation paving the way for an unlawful referendum would be open to challenge in the courts.  That challenge could be initiated in the Court of Session by any individual or organisation with sufficient interest to bring proceedings.  It is important to note that a successful challenge in the courts could not only invalidate the outcome of the referendum -  it could stop the referendum happening in the first place.

""The UK Government acknowledges the political mandate achieved by the SNP at the May 2011 election.  It is precisely because of this political mandate that the UK Government is offering means to ensure that the Scottish Parliament has the power to deliver a referendum that is fair, legal and decisive.  The Section 30 order included in the Government's consultation paper would achieve this, and we are consulting in order to take the views of others on the issue.

 ""The UK Government is happy to discuss these crucially important constitutional issues.  As well as publishing the consultation itself, I look forward to a full airing of views at the question and answer session which will follow my public lecture.  I would also encourage both individuals and organisations to respond to the consultation ""

"Scottish Secretary Michael Moore is asking the First Minister to meet him in Edinburgh this week for talks on the independence referendum.

The UK Government wants to provide Holyrood with the legal powers for a fair and decisive referendum. Michael Moore has already spoken to Mr Salmond proposing talks and will write suggesting a specific time and place - Thursday in Edinburgh - to try and get things moving.

The Secretary of State said 'we want to have this referendum made in Scotland and we can start the work  in the nation's Capital this week.'

The UK Government made clear yesterday that they are happy to engage with the Scottish Government at all levels but that the first contact should be with the Scottish Secretary who is leading the referendum consultation.

Moore also said that he and his Ministerial colleagues will be out in Scotland this week listening to what people think about his referendum plans as well as making the case for Scotland remaining in the UK. Other UK ministers from Defra, BIS and the Foreign Office are due to be in Scotland over the next week and will help with this effort.

Moore will be addressing the CBI in Edinburgh on Monday and the Advocate General will be setting out the legal situation with the referendum at Glasgow University on Friday.

Michael Moore said:

'Since Tuesday, when I set out our plans for how  Scotland can hold a legal referendum, I have spoken to the First Minister and asked him to meet for talks. I have also written to him.

'I was pleased to hear him yesterday suggest talks with the UK Government and I want us to meet in Edinburgh this week to start making progress. We want this referendum made in Scotland and we should start the work this week in the nation's Capital.

'There are real legal problems that need solved and I hope we all share the desire to have a legal, fair and decisive referendum.  We should not waste any more time talking about talks. Let's get round the same table and get cracking with the arrangements for the most important decision Scotland will ever make.

'The sooner we sort out the process, the sooner we can get into the real debate about Scotland's future.'

"Being part of the United Kingdom means Scotland's farmers and fishermen can punch above their weight in Europe and the wider world, the Secretary of State for Scotland said today.

Michael Moore today welcomed the Environment Secretary, Caroline Spelman, to Scotland for a series of visits in the Lothians and Borders.

Moore accompanied Spelman on a visit to Eyemouth, where they met with local fishermen and seafood processors.  They then travelled on to Stow, to meet with representatives from the National Farmers Union of Scotland, and to the Glenkinchie Distillery in Pencaitland, where they discussed issues related to the whisky industry with officials from the Scotch Whisky Association.

Moore commented:

""I was delighted to join the Environment Secretary on her visits to local producers.  Scottish farmers and fishermen make a huge contribution to our society, producing the food we eat and supporting the wider economy, particularly in rural and coastal communities.  Scottish produce is renowned for its quality around the world, with exports increasing.

""The UK, as one of the world's leading economies, has the clout to negotiate the best possible deal for our producers with the European Union and to open up new markets through global trade negotiations.

""We are stronger when we speak with one voice.  We must continue to work together with the Scottish Government and the industry in Scotland to fight our corner around the world.""

Caroline Spelman said:

 ""Scotland's produce is becoming the envy of the world thanks to the hard work of fishermen, farmers and everyone else involved in food and drink production.

""The success that the industry achieved in 2011 was phenomenal and brought enormous benefits to the economy of not just Scotland but the whole of the UK.

""We must now find a way to make sure that the industry can thrive by reforming the Common Agriculture Policy and Common Fisheries Policy in a way that allows farmers and fishermen to continue to be successful in the future.""

"The UK Government is prepared to change the law so that the Scottish Parliament can hold a legal referendum on independence, Scottish Secretary Michael Moore announced today. The Government will now consult the people of Scotland on the best way to facilitate a legal, fair and decisive referendum.

In a statement to the House of Commons, the Secretary of State revealed that the  UK Government's clear legal view is that any independence referendum which the Scottish Parliament legislated for with its current powers would be unlawful as the constitution is reserved to the UK Parliament under the Scotland Act 1998.

Michael Moore said the UK Government's strongly held view is that Scotland should remain part of the UK but he told MPs that the 2011 Holyrood election result meant that there should now be a legal, fair and decisive referendum on Scottish independence.

The UK Government has today published a consultation document which looks at the ways in which a legal referendum on independence could be held.  While the document sets out a number of ways that a referendum could be legislated for, Ministers are prepared to use a Section 30 Order from the 1998 Scotland Act to devolve the necessary legal power to the Scottish Parliament. Such an Order requires the approval of the both the Scottish and UK Parliaments. 

The Government is clear that a referendum should be held sooner rather than later and the consultation proposes that the Order gives the Scottish Parliament power to hold a referendum by a specific date:  the Government has not set out a view on the specific date for a referendum in the consultation and invites views on when a referendum should be held. 

The paper also sets out what the Government regards as the essential criteria for a fair and decisive referendum. The Government is now consulting on these important matters with people in Scotland and will also seek the views of the Scottish Government. The consultation seeks views on issues such as:

- Should there be a single question on independence requiring a straight ""yes/no"" answer?  
- Should the referendum be run by the Electoral Commission following well established rules?  
- Who should have the vote?  
- What views are there on the timing of the referendum?

Speaking in the House of Commons, Michael Moore said:

""Since last year's election, we have been asking the Scottish Government to set out its plans for a referendum.  But so far it has not done so. In particular, it has not said anything more about its legal power to deliver a referendum. 

""This is not an issue that can be ducked. To legislate for a referendum on independence, the Scottish Parliament must have the legal power to do so.  It is the Government's clear view that the Scottish Parliament does not have that legal power.

""Scotland's future within the UK will be the most important decision we, as Scots, take in our lifetime.  It is essential that the referendum is legal, fair and decisive.  As a Government, we have been clear since May 2011 that we will not stand in the way of a referendum on independence.  But neither will we stand on the sidelines and let uncertainty continue.

""The 1998 Scotland Act is clear.  The Scottish Parliament cannot legislate on matters reserved to this Parliament.  Amongst the issues that are reserved is the constitution, including ""the Union of the Kingdoms of Scotland and England"".  Any Act of the Scottish Parliament that ""relates to"" a reserved matter is quite simply ""not law"". Whether or not a Bill ""relates to"" a reserved matter depends on its purpose and effect.  

""We are clear that the Scottish Government¿s purpose in bringing forward a referendum is to secure independence. Their intended effect is to secure a mandate for negotiating this.  Both purpose and effect relate directly to the reserved matter of the Union. Any distinction between a binding or advisory referendum is artificial.

""As the law stands, an independence referendum bill is outside the competence of the Scottish Parliament.  A bill could be challenged in court and it is our view that the Scottish Government would lose.

""So the consultation paper I am publishing today sets out different ways to deliver a legal, fair and decisive referendum.

""It explains how the powers for a referendum could be devolved under the Section 30 order-making provisions in the Scotland Act 1998 - our preferred approach.  It also invites views on devolving the powers using other legislation, including the current Scotland Bill, and for opinions on the possibility of running the referendum directly.

""Given the clear legal problem that exists, we want to work with the Scottish Government to provide the answer.  This is not about the mandates of Scotland's two governments, or who calls the shots.  It is about empowering the people of Scotland to participate in a legal referendum.  That means that the UK Government is willing to give the Scottish Parliament the powers to hold a referendum which they otherwise cannot do legally.

""Mr Speaker, this Government believes passionately in the United Kingdom. For over 300 years our country has brought people together in the most successful multi-national state the world has known. This Government is clear that independence is not in the interests of Scotland.  The United Kingdom brings strength to Scotland; Scotland brings strength to the United Kingdom.

""We recognise that this is not a view shared by all.  But politicians from both sides of the debate owe it to everyone in Scotland to ensure that the referendum is delivered in a legal, fair and decisive way. The future of Scotland must not be worked out in secret, behind closed doors.  Nor determined by wrangling in the courts.    It is my task to ensure this referendum is made in Scotland, by the people of Scotland, for the future of Scotland.""

The UK Government has now invited the Scottish Government to hold talks on trying to agree a way forward.

The consultation will run until March 9 after which the UK Government will announce how it intends to proceed.

"The Scotland Office Minister David Mundell visited the Scottish firm which built the Olympic basketball stadium in Glasgow today to see first-hand how Scotland is already benefiting from London hosting the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games this summer.

The Minister took a tour of Barr Construction to hear more about the challenges of building one of the largest temporary venues ever built and met with management and staff who had worked on delivering the project.

 David Mundell said:

""The Olympic year is going to be a great success for every part of the UK, including Scotland. Barr Construction has had a key role to play in delivering the Olympic facilities on time and on budget - they are a great example of just one of more than 100 Scottish companies doing well from the Games and the economic growth they are bringing to the whole of the UK.

""In addition to Scotland hosting a number of pre-Games training camps and Olympic football at Hampden , we will also have a number of Scottish Olympians competing in the Games. I am sure the whole country will support them and this once in a lifetime event."" 

This morning, the Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore attended a Cabinet meeting on the Olympic Park in Stratford, East London, chaired by the Prime Minister David Cameron. The meeting focused on how every part of the UK can take full advantage of the Olympic and Paralympic Games and the unique chance that that the country has to sell itself to a massive international audience.   
This afternoon, Cabinet Ministers are visiting towns and cities across the United Kingdom to see for themselves how businesses, sports facilities, schools and organisations are benefiting from the Olympic and Paralympic Games.

With little over seven months before the opening ceremony, the construction phase is 95% complete and the project continues to be on time and on budget. Since work began on the East London site in 2008, £6.39billion worth of contracts have been awarded to over 1500 business in the UK.

 More than 100 Scottish companies have secured tens of millions of pounds of contracts related to the Games, with 25 Scottish firms being directly involved in building the Olympic Park, including:

- Barr in Glasgow - which helped to build the basketball arena, one of the biggest temporary venues ever built  
- Impact Test Equipment in North Ayrshire - which provided aggregate for the Aquatics Centre  
- Balmoral Sectional Tanks in Aberdeen - which supplied utilities for the Olympic Stadium

Many more Scottish firms have picked up other Olympic-related contracts - from producing official Games merchandise, to providing temporary power across many of the Games venues.

Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport, Jeremy Hunt said:

""London 2012 gives us an opportunity to showcase the best of Britain to the world and what this country has to offer. From our beautiful countryside to historic sites, sporting venues to our amazing cultural offer Britain really does have something for everyone. I am confident that we will put on a sporting spectacular this summer with some magical, medal moments that we will never forget and that will inspire many young people to get involved in sport.""

""As a Scot I think it is vital that the Scottish people can make a clear decision about our future within the United Kingdom.

""Our priority is to ensure that the decision is taken in Scotland, by people in Scotland.  

""What I want to do is get rid of the legal uncertainty and allow the people in Scotland to decide our future in a clear and decisive way.

""I  will be setting out to Parliament what we think is most appropriate way of achieving this objective.

"As we enter the new year I expect that the economy and constitution will feature just as prominently as they did in 2011.

While the economy has a direct effect on the lives of everyone it is normally the case that constitutional debate only really concerns those of us in the world of politics and the media. That is about to change as Scotland leaves 2011 knowing that we will soon need to make a decision on whether we wish to remain part of the UK.

We have seen the second year of the coalition government working towards getting the economy back on track. The global economic picture has been difficult, particularly within the Eurozone, but we have stayed our course and will be the better for it. The UK economy has remained stable against that backdrop, underlining the fact we made the right choices at the right time. That is what good government should be - making a choice and sticking with it.

Our deficit reduction plan has helped restore confidence in th UK economy and kept interest rates low but we are by no means immune to the issues facing our trading partners in the euro zone. Our borrowing costs have fallen to record lows, which shows the UK government debt is seen as a safe bet in the global debt crisis and our credit rating has been restored to its previous highest possible level.

But there is still much to do, particularly when it comes to employment. With the Scottish unemployment rate higher than the rest of the UK, both of Scotland's governments must focus on the issue in 2012. It will not be easy but we have already put major initiatives such as the Youth Contract in place and will continue to do all we can to get people back into work.

There are few issues of more importance to us all and I want to see all our powers, both reserved and devolved, brought to bear on it. That includes the pressing issue of youth unemployment which continues to affect cities and towns across Scotland. After a series of local events this year, in March I will host a national summit bringing together politicians, agencies, employers and others as we continue to put our collective effort into the fight to get young people into the job market.

But there is another issue facing Scotland which now looms large. The Scottish election result in May means that all of us across Scotland will soon need to decide where we stand on staying in the UK or becoming a separate country.  It will be the most important political decision that the Scottish people will ever make.

I am confident that people will listen to the arguments and make the right choice, but I want to make two important points on how we conduct this debate in 2012.

Firstly, we must have an open and frank debate. Everyone is entitled to their view and it is particularly important that experts in different fields are listened to respectfully, even if they are not agreed with.

I do not believe people will be neutral on this issue next year, given the great uncertainty it generates. It is too important - and potentially irreversible -  a subject for silence. We saw a number of strong opinions and arguments in favour of Scotland's place in the UK this year but I know many others hold similar views. Next year is the time to air them and choose to enter the debate: at stake is Scotland's place in the world and our future prosperity.

 Secondly, we need clarity in the next few months on how this important decision is to be arrived at.  Since May the Scottish Government has not been clear. As it stands we might have a referendum in 2014, 2015 or 2016. There is talk of multiple questions, different options and creating a whole new body to run the poll.  It's only fair for people in Scotland to be able to understand the plan.

I believe it is right that there now should be a referendum.  But equally, the Scottish people have the right to expect a referendum that is legal, fair and decisive. There are still many questions for the Scottish Government to answer.

Next year will also see the UK Government complete the legislation that transfers the largest ever set of financial powers to the Scottish Parliament. This will trigger a different kind of devolution with much greater financial accountability for MSPs at Holyrood.  
   
There are still some important milestones to pass. There are numerous amendments tabled in the House of Lords for the Committee stage which begins in late January. The Scottish Government want to see some changes, but we still need to see more detail from them. We will continue to work to fulfil this key coalition pledge to transfer much greater powers to the Scottish Parliament.

 I look forward to fighting hard for Scotland in 2012 and its continuing place in the UK, the most successful partnership of nations in history.

 The Olympics and the Queen's Diamond Jubilee  will also provide much for Scots everywhere to enjoy and celebrate in 2012.

 I wish you all a very happy and prosperous New Year.

"The publication of the Scottish Government's referendum plans should clear the way for serious talks in Scotland about building a legal, fair and decisive referendum, said the Scottish Secretary Michael Moore.

The Minister said he is confident that talks with the First Minister in Edinburgh this Friday can ""plot the course towards agreeing a  legal referendum that follows the normal and fair rules that the Scottish people associate with a referendum"".

Speaking on the eve on the Scottish Government's consultation, Michael Moore said:

""Two weeks ago,  our Government published plans on how to create a legal, fair and decisive referendum on Scottish independence. Once the Scottish Government publish their plans the way should be clear for us to have serious discussions, right here in Scotland, about how we make such a referendum happen.

""I want the Scottish Government paper to have a clear acknowledgement that a legal referendum is in the interests of the Scottish people and that the two Governments should work together to achieve that. I also hope they will confirm that they support a simple yes-no question on independence. That is what people expect. I also hope that if the Scottish Government continue to put forward their preference of Autumn 2014 for a referendum that they will justify why they want three more years of delay and economic uncertainty.

""Everyone wants to have a referendum that avoids a courtroom wrangle. Everyone in Scotland expects to have a referendum that follows the normal and fair rules we associate with a referendum.  We should not start re-writing the rule book in the run up to the most important decision Scotland will ever make.

""The Scottish Government have shed more light on their referendum plans in the past two weeks then they did in the previous two years.

"The Scottish people should be allowed to sit in the referendum driving seat next year, Scotland Office Minister David Mundell said today.

Following the publication yesterday by the Government of a proper timetable to have the independence referendum next September, Mr Mundell said it was disappointing that the Scottish Government was blocking the chance for the Scottish people to have their say.

David Mundell said:

""There is no reason why the Scottish people should have to wait nearly three years to have their say in an independence referendum. We have produced a timetable that shows how you can give people their say on independence next September. No corners are cut and all processes are properly followed. But instead of working with us to put the Scottish public firmly in the referendum driving seat, the Scottish Government have resorted to insults and mistakes. This is a very poor show and people will be mystified.

""The Scottish Government claim the 2013 proposal is a 'silly  distraction'  and  'full of holes' but they don't say why and they don't say what. People want action not insults.

""The only point of substance raised by the Scottish Government is also wrong. The Electoral Commission ask for ten weeks to review the question - not test the ballot paper. They review the question while the Bill is going through Parliament, so it does not need to add an extra ten weeks to the schedule. If the ballot paper needs to be tested it can happen at the same time or even sooner. The Scottish Government need to get on top of this sort of detail very quickly rather than trying to shout down those who hold a different view from them.

""It wasn't so long ago that the Scottish Government were very enthusiastic about holding an independence referendum. There has definitely been a change in the tune coming out of St Andrew's House.  In 2009, they wanted to hold the referendum in 2010. In 2010, they wanted to hold it 'as soon as possible'. Now they want to wait for a few years to ensure 'the fullest possible debate'.  This is their fourth consultation on this subject and their third draft Bill. How much fuller can the debate be?

""Politicians and Parliaments are always having their say. It is time for the people of Scotland to decide whether Scotland should separate from the rest of the UK.""

He said the United Kingdom was a world leader in the industry, through globally recognised events such as London Fashion Week and access to established and emerging talent and skills across the country.

The Scottish Academy of Fashion is an ambitious project to establish Scotland as a global centre in fashion-related learning and commercially relevant research. It involves leading universities across Scotland  and aims to provide an easy way for companies to access the full range of skills available in Scottish fashion and textiles education.

He met three fashion students shortlisted for the The Johnstons of Elgin Award, a prize which rewards innovative design and aids the development of Scotland as a global centre of excellence in fashion-related learning.

The winners will receive a cash prize and an internship as well has having their winning garments displayed by the Academy in industry-focussed showcases.

The Minister met the Director of Knowledge Transfer, the Head of the School of Design and co-founder of the Academy on the visit as well as the Chair of the Scottish Textile Industry Association.

Michael Moore said:

""Scotland can already celebrate the fact we have leading lights in the fashion world, with major Scottish designers such Jonathan Saunders and Christopher Kane paving the way for others to follow. We also have companies such as Johnstons of Elgin, Harris Tweed and Pringle successfully showcasing and exporting their goods and textiles across the world.

""That is a strong creative base which we can build on in the future to ensure we continue to lead from the front in the industry. The Scottish Academy of Fashion is doing excellent work in pairing the creativity of news and upcoming designers with the commercial know-how to deliver their talents onto this incredibly important market.""

"Scottish Secretary Michael Moore has said there is no good reason why the Scottish people should have to wait nearly three years to have their say on Scotland's future.

Mr Moore today produced a referendum timetable that would meet all the legal and procedural requirements and still allow Scots to vote on independence in September 2013 - a full year earlier than the Scottish Government are currently proposing.

The Scottish Secretary said the ""go slow"" approach of the Scottish Government is unnecessary and lacks public support.

In 2009 the Scottish Government's proposed legislating for and holding the referendum in less than a year. But Mr Moore said that now that there is a real prospect of the referendum taking place, they want to ""kick the referendum can down the road"".  

Michael Moore said:

""No one has yet explained to me why the people of Scotland should have to wait nearly three years to make the most important decision we will ever make. It is not in the interests of the Scottish people to build up uncertainty and make them wait.

""The timetable I have produced today shows there is no good reason for the Scottish Government's go slow approach. We can follow all the proper procedures and parliamentary processes and still have a referendum in September 2013.

""Recent polls have certainly indicated that people think we should get on with the referendum and hold it sooner than 2014. That certainly makes sense to me.

""The Scottish Government outlined plans in 2009 where they proposed consulting, drafting a Bill, legislating and holding a referendum all within 12 months. But now, for reasons of their own, they want to kick the referendum can down the road.

""The timetable the Scottish Government have set out has heel dragging built into it. There are months and months set aside for straight forward tasks. Their consultation finishes in May and they then propose taking the whole summer to analyse responses and then the rest of the year to amend their draft Bill accordingly. That could be done properly in a much shorter time frame.

""The Scotland Bill will see us transfer the largest ever package of financial powers to the Scottish Parliament over the next four years. Powers over borrowing, income tax and property tax will all transfer to Holyrood.

""Before we  can move further powers to Edinburgh we need to know if Scotland is to remain part of the UK. That is entirely logical. We should settle the independence question as early as we can.  

""Both Governments should work through the issues we don¿t agree on and produce a referendum that is legal, fair and decisive. If we can negotiate a Section 30 Order to transfer the legal powers to Holyrood then we can give the people of Scotland their say in a referendum next year.  That's a timetable made in the interest of people in Scotland, not politicians in parliaments.""

The following sets out the Secretary of State's timetable for a 2013 referendum. It shows three ways in which to speed up the Scottish Government's timetable and allow the people of Scotland to have their say a full year earlier than the Scottish Government are proposing:

The Secretary of State for Scotland has used the UK Ministerial visit to the Vatican to discuss key issues such as international aid, human rights, poverty and climate change.

Ahead of the ministerial delegation being received by His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI today, the Minister also met a number of Cardinals and Archbishops in a series of meetings.

They discussed the work of the UK Government in delivering international aid and development was raised as a key issue and the Secretary of State underlined the commitment to helping the world¿s poorest people by becoming the first G20 country to adhere to the pledge to spend 0.7% of our gross national income on overseas assistance.

Michael Moore said:

""This visit has stressed the many areas of common interest which exist between the UK and the Holy See, particularly on important issues such as the global fight against poverty, overseas development and taking steps to combat climate change.

""We have had a very constructive exchange of views on ways we can continue to work together across social, economic and cultural issues for the wider good.""

The Minister also took part in a roundtable meeting between the UK Government and the Holy See in the Vatican this morning, led by the Rt Hon Baroness Warsi and His Excellency Archbishop Dominique Mamberti, Secretary for Relations with States.

It discussed the importance of the current visit and discussed the willingness of the government to work with the Holy See across a wide range of issues, while welcoming the positive role of the Catholic Church in British society.

The visit marks the 30th anniversary of the establishment of full diplomatic relations between the United Kingdom and the Holy See in 1982, and follows the successful visit by his Holiness Pope Benedict XVI to the United Kingdom in September 2010.

Other Ministers in the delegation include:

- The Rt Hon Jeremy Hunt MP, Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport

"Unemployment in Scotland rose by 16,000, to 231,000 in the period October to December 2011, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) data released today. The Scottish unemployment rate is 8.6 per cent, above the UK average of 8.4 per cent.   
 

The labour market statistics also show employment in Scotland has decreased by 20,000 over the three months to October - December 2011. The number of those in employment in Scotland now stands at 2,458,000.

The Scotland Office Minister David Mundell said:

""These figures are disappointing and show there are many challenges ahead for the Scottish and UK Governments. Each number we see today is not merely a statistic; it is an individual or family directly affected by unemployment.  That is why we are determined to do all we can to create the right conditions for the private sector to create long-term, sustainable jobs. The increased international uncertainty makes it all the more critical for the whole of the UK economy to maintain market confidence. This government's policies are achieving that aim.

""Today's figures also show youth unemployment continues to be a cause of great concern. The Secretary of State will chair a National Convention on Youth Employment in Dundee in March. This will bring together Ministers from both the UK and Scottish Governments, officials from their respective agencies, employers and representatives from the many organisations involved in supporting young people into work.""

"Scottish Secretary Michael Moore described today's referendum talks with the First Minister as a ""useful start"" although he said there is ""still some way to travel""  before the UK and Scottish Governments can reach agreement on the detail of the referendum.

Mr Moore said officials from both governments would now discuss the option of using a Section 30 Order, approved by the UK and Scottish Parliaments, in order to put the referendum on a proper legal footing.

The Scottish Secretary said that there were important issues such as the timing of the referendum and the need for a single question on the ballot paper and the franchise where the two governments do not agree.

Following the meeting in Edinburgh, Scottish Secretary Michael Moore said:

""The talks were helpful and both sides are keen to sort out the referendum process as quickly as possible so that we can get on to the real debate on Scotland's future.

""Having said that, this is the most important decision Scotland will ever make so we need to ensure the referendum is legal, fair and decisive.

""There is no question that we still have some way to travel to reach agreement on some important aspects of the referendum. I am still not convinced that the people of Scotland should have to wait nearly three years to have their say on independence. It is a long time until Autumn 2014 and I have still to hear a good reason for why we should have to wait so long.

""I also believe that an independence referendum should be a straight question on independence. Whether Scotland should be part of the UK is the issue we are dealing with. I want the people of Scotland to be asked a straight question, fairly and clearly, whether Scotland should be independent or remain part of the UK.

""The UK Government is also not persuaded that we should start changing the referendum rules to allow 16 and 17 year olds to vote. Our view is that the electorate that elects the Scottish Parliament should be the same one that votes in the referendum.

""It is in everyone's interests that both of Scotland's governments work together to agree a referendum that is legal, fair and decisive. We need a process and outcome that is fair for all of Scotland and that is what we're committed to achieving.""

"Organisations across Scotland will be able to apply for funding from the Coastal Communities Fund from April, allowing them to support the economic development of a wide range of projects including those that support charities, the environment, education and health.

The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore announced the launch of the fund's Prospectus on a visit to St Abb's Harbour in Berwickshire today (Thursday 9 February).

Scottish organisations will be able to express interest from March and make formal bids on the £4m fund in April. The Highlands is to  receive £1.85m from the fund, with £2.05m for the rest of Scotland from the overall £23.7m available throughout the UK.

The Fund will be financed by the Government from revenues from the Crown Estate's marine activities and will be UK wide.  Funding for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland will be determined by the amount of revenue generated in each country. 

The UK Government is working with the Big Fund, part of the Big Lottery Fund, to find the best ways to deliver benefits for Scotland's communities.

The Secretary of State Michael Moore welcomed the announcement and said:

""This is an innovative fund which will create many opportunities for coastal communities across Scotland and help strengthen local economies. The £4m available in 2012 can make a big difference and I hope organisations will respond to the opportunity with creative bids which help the wellbeing and opportunities of people in the area. The Crown Estate has been the focus of much debate in recent months and this initiative is a great example of the revenues raised in Scotland being put to good use.""

Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, said:

""Having grown up in a coastal community in Scotland, I am only too aware of the vital role these communities play in the UK. It is fair that we share the Crown Estate¿s marine revenues equally and I am delighted to launch the Coastal Communities fund prospectus today.

""We look forward to receiving innovative bids from charities, businesses, social enterprises and local organisations, which support the economic development of the community.""

"The Departmental Expenditure Limit (DEL) of the Scottish Government for the current financial year will be increased by more than £360m, Scottish Secretary Michael Moore announced today (Wednesday 8 February).

Publishing the Supplementary Estimates for 2011-12, Mr Moore said that Holyrood's capital spending would increase by £221m and resource spending by £140m.

Supplementary Estimates is the mechanism whereby the UK Parliament transfers money for the Scottish Parliament to spend on devolved matters. If the Scotland Bill, currently going through the UK Parliament, becomes law then, in future, Holyrood would raise around 35% of the money it spends.

Significant additional resources detailed in the statement today by the Scottish Secretary include:

- £50m in pre-payments to help with the new Forth Bridge;

- £50m for the Sleeper train service from Scotland to London;

- almost £16m in lieu of Barnett consequentials to settle the dispute over Olympic spending.

The Scottish Secretary said:

""The Scottish Government is benefitting from significant extra resources that have been made available by us in the course of this financial year. Some of this comes from the Barnett formula but a lot is also invested directly in Scotland by the UK Government. The basic state pension increase will benefit 1 million Scottish pensioners. Scottish drivers are being helped by our decision to defer the 3p fuel duty increase planned for January. The Youth Contract will also see the UK Government fund help for young people in Scotland looking for work.

""The new Forth Bridge and the Sleeper service are vitally important transport links for Scotland. They are also prime examples of how Scotland's two governments can work together to better serve the people of Scotland.

""The Scottish Government is already using the new pre-payment mechanism to help finance £50m of work on the new Forth Bridge. We also want them to benefit from the Scotland Bill tax powers - worth £12bn when added to Holyrood's existing tax powers - allowing them to raise a third of their own budget. This will provide Holyrood with more financial powers than ever before while retaining the financial security that comes with being a strong part of the UK.  The Sterling currency, low interest rates and a AAA rating are all important to Scotland.""

"Scottish Secretary Michael Moore has said he hopes the First Minister will agree to give people in Scotland the certainty that comes with a legal, fair and decisive referendum when they meet in Edinburgh next Monday. 

Speaking to the Law Society of Scotland in Edinburgh, Mr Moore said everyone wants the referendum to be legal and it will be helpful if he and the First Minister can agree during their opening referendum talks next Monday  that a Section 30 order is regarded by both Governments as the ""preferred route to a legal referendum.""

A Section 30 Order can be used to devolve powers from Westminster to Holyrood and requires the approval of both Parliaments.

Michael Moore said good progress has been made in recent weeks and that ""we have already come too far to revert to a referendum that could land us all in the courts"".

Following the publication of referendum consultation papers by both the UK and Scottish Governments in January it was agreed that the Scottish Secretary and First Minister should hold talks. The first of these meetings is scheduled for Edinburgh on Monday, February 13th.

Speaking today Michael Moore said:

""On Monday, the First Minister and I will open talks on how we can deliver a legal, fair and decisive referendum for the people of Scotland. The Scottish people will not accept a referendum whose process and outcome will be open to legal challenge.

""Good progress has already been made in the past few weeks. Both Governments agree that we want a referendum that is free from legal dispute and that produces a result that everyone accepts.

""I think it would be helpful on Monday if we can agree that both Governments regard the Section 30 order as the preferred route to a legal referendum. There would still be a number of issues to discuss and resolve but it would send a strong signal that both Governments want to work together to make sure the referendum is legal.

""It would be good to agree in principle that, if we can sort out the detail,  a Section 30 Order, approved by both Parliaments, is what both Governments are aiming for.

""Good progress has already been made over the past few weeks on how we can achieve a legal, fair and decisive referendum.   We have already come too far to revert to referendum that could land us all in the courts.""

"The Budget will mean that 162,000 lower paid Scots no longer have to pay income tax, Scottish Secretary Michael Moore said today. He also highlighted the importance of the Budget for Scottish jobs and investment.

Mr Moore said key sectors of the Scottish economy such as oil and gas and the games industry have been targeted for specific support in the Budget while a further cut in Corporation tax will help all businesses in Scotland.

The Scottish Secretary also highlighted that since the 2010 Spending Review the Scottish Government have now received more than £1 billion in extra revenue from Barnett consequentials, of which £730m is for extra Capital spending. In the coming financial year, 2012-13, the Scottish Government will receive £336.3m more than originally allocated in the 2010 Spending Review.

Budget 2012 measures which will help Scotland include:

* An increase in Personal Allowance by a further £1,100 in April 2013 will remove a further 73,000 Scots from tax and benefit 2.1m Scots. This means that more than 160,000 Scots have now been removed from the tax system under this Government.  
* Raising the individual threshold for the withdrawal of child benefit to £50,000 will benefit 63,000 households in Scotland.

* A package of oil and gas measures that will stimulate billions of pounds of additional investment and increase production in the UK Continental Shelf.  
* The Government will introduce corporation tax reliefs for the video game industry from April 2013.

* Corporation tax is being cut by an additional 1 per cent to 24% in 2012 and will be cut to 22% by 2014. Corporation Tax stood at 28% when this Government came to office.  
* The National Loan Guarantee Scheme announced yesterday will help smaller businesses in Scottish receive cheaper loans.  
* The Government will make 100% capital allowances for plant or machinery investment from April 2012 at agreed sites at Irvine, Nigg and Dundee.

* There are Barnett consequentials in this Budget of £20.3m  
* Total Barnett consequentials since the 2010 Spending Review now exceed £1bn. This is £730.3m in Capital DEL and £367.2m in Resource DEL.  
* The total additional Barnett consequentials for 2012-13 since the Spending Review are £336.3m

The Scottish Secretary Michael Moore said:

""The Government has used this Budget to provide greater fairness for individuals and  to help Scottish businesses.  This is a Budget that will create more jobs in Scotland and it will help those who are already in jobs.

""We are committed to taking lower paid Scots out of the tax system altogether. The increase in personal allowances is the biggest rise in the last thirty years and will mean that a further 73,000 people in Scotland will not pay income tax.

""Key Scottish industries like the oil and gas sector and the games industry will benefit from specifically targeted measures in this Budget. We are also supporting Scottish business as a whole with another reduction in Corporation Tax to 24%. We have reached our original target for the Parliament and set out our ambitious new target to help Scottish business with further reductions to 22%.

""I am also pleased that we are able to offer tax help to the games industry in Scotland. Places like Dundee and Edinburgh will benefit from this move and I believe it can provide a real boost for this important industry.

""This Budget ensures the continuing stability of the UK economy while providing real help to people and business in Scotland. Scotland benefits from being part of a strong United Kingdom on the one hand and at the same time being able to take devolved decisions in Edinburgh. Since the Spending Review 18 months ago the Government has now allocated £1 billion in extra resources for the Scottish Government to spend. Nearly three-quarters of that money was for capital projects.

"The Scotland Bill is set to bring major new powers to the Scottish Parliament after the UK Government and Scottish Government reached agreement on the provisions of the Bill, the Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore announced today (Wednesday 21 March).

The Scottish Secretary today set out in a Written Ministerial Statement to the House of Commons the measures agreed with the Scottish Government on the tax powers, borrowing powers and non-finance elements of the Scotland Bill.

Among the measures announced by Mr Moore are:

* The UK and Scottish Governments have the intention of reaching agreement on all implementation issues.  
* Borrowing limits will be reviewed regularly ahead of Spending Reviews.  
* The Government will shortly launch a consultation on the Scottish Government being able to issue its own bonds.  
* A certification requirement will not be introduced on appeals to the UK Supreme Court from Scottish criminal cases  but there will be a review of the new arrangements after three years of operation.

The Scottish Government will today  table a Legislative Consent  Memorandum which recommends the Scottish Parliament votes in support of the Bill when the Legislative Consent Motion is put before Holyrood.  The Scottish Secretary has always said he wanted the Scottish Parliament  to give their support for the largest ever transfer of powers from London to Holyrood.

If the Scotland Bill receives the support of both the UK and Scottish Parliaments over the coming weeks it will bring about the biggest transfer of fiscal power since the creation of the UK and includes:

* a new Scottish rate of income tax  
* the devolution of stamp duty land tax   
* the devolution of landfill tax  
* the power to create new taxes  
* new borrowing powers

This will bring a much higher level of financial accountability to Holyrood as MSPs become responsible for raising more of the money they spend.

The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore said:

""Today marks a major step forward for devolution and I am glad Scotland's two governments have reached agreement over the Scotland Bill. The UK Government has been clear from the outset we believe it is the right package of new powers for Scotland. We have also been clear that we wanted the Scottish Parliament to support the measures contained in the Scotland Bill. It will strengthen devolution and the cross-government support for the Bill is good news for Scotland.

""There has been a great deal of debate around the Bill and we have worked closely and flexibly with the Scottish Government to make the changes required to secure an agreement. The Bill also remains faithful to the work of the Calman Commission which received such overwhelming support at the last General Election.""

The Secretary of State for Scotland (Michael Moore):  The Scotland Bill is a significant step forward in Scottish devolution.  It provides for the biggest transfer of fiscal power from London since the creation of the United Kingdom - including a new Scottish rate of income tax, full devolution of stamp duty land tax and landfill tax, and new borrowing powers.  Together, the OBR forecast that these measures will enable the Scottish Government to raise between £5bn and £6bn of its budget in addition to around £4bn it currently raises in council tax and non-domestic rates.

Since its introduction in November 2010, the Bill has had detailed scrutiny in the UK and Scottish Parliaments.  In Westminster, it has passed successfully through its Commons stages and will soon complete Lords Committee consideration.  In Holyrood, the Scottish Parliament voted overwhelmingly in support of the Bill last March.

After productive discussions with the Scottish Government in recent weeks, the Government is today announcing a package of measures in the Bill and supporting non-legislative arrangements to show that the powers will operate in a fair and sustainable way to the benefit of Scotland and the rest of the UK.

Agreement has been reached with the Scottish Government on both the finance and non-finance provisions included in the Bill and the Scottish Government will today table a Legislative Consent Memorandum recommending that the Scottish Parliament votes in support of the Bill on a further Legislative Consent Motion for the Bill.

Today's announcement provides more detail about the operation of the new tax and borrowing powers and about the non-finance elements of the Scotland Bill.  The Government is committed to: 

* The Government will ensure that changes in the Scottish Government¿s budget are closely linked to the performance of its economy by adjusting Scotland¿s budget to reflect new tax powers using the model recommended to the Welsh Assembly in the Holtham Report.  This approach, agreed with the Scottish Finance Minister and the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, will help protect the Scottish Government¿s budget from wider macro-economic shocks. 

* The Government will work together with the Scottish Government over coming months and years to give operational effect to the powers including the block grant adjustment, in a fair and sustainable way with the intention of reaching agreement on all implementation issues.

* The Scotland Bill will be amended to require the Secretary of State for Scotland and Scottish Ministers to produce annual reports to the UK and Scottish Parliaments on the progress of transferring the tax and borrowing powers to the Scottish Government.

* In line with long-standing principles of devolved funding, the Scottish Government will pay for its new income tax system of administration.  The Government will explore the scope to offset some of the savings from HMRC ceasing its administration of stamp duty land tax and landfill tax.

* Borrowing limits will be reviewed regularly ahead of Spending Reviews through the Joint Exchequer Committee.

* The Scottish Government will be given access to loans over a longer period in principle, subject to the ability to repay and the type of asset.

* The Government will shortly launch a consultation on the Scottish Government issuing its own bonds.

* Aggregates Levy will be devolved once the legal challenges in the European and UK courts have been fully resolved.  
* The Government is open to considering what further powers might be devolved  after a referendum on independence.

* The clauses reserving the regulation of health professions and insolvency will be removed, following assurances from the Scottish Government that they will work closely with the Government to ensure consistent regulatory regimes apply to health professions and that insolvency procedures are kept up to date and operate effectively throughout the UK.

* The clause allowing partial referral of Acts of the Scottish Parliament to the Supreme Court will be removed at the request of the Scottish Government.  This means in the future - as at present - a full Act could be referred to the Supreme Court, even if only a single provision raised competence issues.

* The clause on implementing international obligations will be removed following assurances from the Scottish Government that they will work closely with the Government to ensure that the UK continues at all times to implement its international obligations.  If there is a failure to implement any international obligation the UK Government may use its powers under s.58 (2) of the Scotland Act to direct Scottish Ministers.

* Additional amendments will be made to the provisions on appeals to the Supreme Court from Scottish criminal cases.  A certification requirement will not be introduced.  However, the new arrangements will be subject to a review, chaired by the Lord Justice General of Scotland, after three years of operation.  Certification will be included within the scope of the review, and it will be possible for changes to be made to the arrangements by subordinate legislation following the review.

These announcements today meet the tests the Government has set for changes to the Bill package - they are based on evidence, maintain the cross-party consensus which supports the Bill, and will benefit Scotland without detriment to the rest of the UK.

The Scotland Bill was introduced in November 2010 and has had detailed scrutiny in the UK and Scottish Parliaments. At Westminster it has passed successfully through its Commons stages and will soon complete Lords Committee consideration. At Holyrood, the Scottish Parliament voted overwhelmingly in support of the Bill last March.  It was also the subject of scrutiny by the Scottish Parliament Scotland Bill Committee.

"Scotland needs its two governments and employers to work together to create work opportunities for young people across Scotland, the Secretary of State Michael Moore said today.

He highlighted three initiatives to help boost youth employment at the first National Convention on the issue at Dundee College today (Thursday 15 March).

The event was attended by around 300 delegates from both public and private sector organisations, including Jobcentre Plus.

The Minister was joined by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Iain Duncan Smith and the Scottish Government Ministers John Swinney and Angela Constance in Dundee.

The event is a culmination of several months of engagement across Scotland, during which the Secretary of State has met hundreds of young people, employers and stakeholders throughout the employment sector.

Moore told the audience agreement had been reached between the Department of Work and Pensions and ScotRail to offer unemployed people in Scotland a discount of 50% on rail travel throughout Scotland.

This will be available at the discretion of  Jobcentre Plus advisers from 13 weeks of registered unemployment, and will be introduced to Jobcentres from early April.

He also said the UK Government's Youth Contract announcement included an extra 250,000 Work Experience or sector-based work academy places over the next three years.   This will take the total to at least 100,000 a year Work Experience opportunities across Great Britain.

The Minister said over 2,000 young people have started on Work Experience in Scotland and announced a challenge to the assembled employers to provide a further 500 Work Experience placements. 

He added that the Youth Contract announcement also included 160,000 wage incentives over three years worth £2,275 each, for employers who employ an 18-24 year-old from the Work Programme.

The Youth Contract goes live in April and the Minister  used the convention to promote wage incentives to employers in the audience. He also announced a future programme of employer engagement around Scotland to encourage the recruitment of Work Programme participants and take-up of wage incentives.

Moore told the convention:

""I think it is of particular importance that the UK Government and the Scottish Government - the two governments of Scotland - work together on this critical issue.

""The purpose of today is to bring the key players in the youth employment debate on a focused basis.

""Youth unemployment is a problem which can appear to have more questions than answers but we can achieve far more together than apart.

""We need to ensure that efforts across all of our responsibilities connect. It is easy to work in isolation but with stretched resources we must work smarter, harder and together.

""Employers are the lynch pin in any employment policy.  It is very clear that we need to ensure Scottish employers know what help is available to them and crucially that any available help is appropriate to the needs of Scottish business. 

""Today we are promoting the availability of work incentives to employers.  From April, under the Youth Contract, Scottish employers will be able to access up to £2,275 wage incentive for each 18-24 year-old they employ for at least 26 weeks from the Work Programme.

""Following today's event I will be embarking on a series of events around Scotland to spread the word and encourage employers to take advantage of this incentive.

""The provision of bona fide long term jobs is our prime goal.  However, we know from our discussions with young people, that short term Work Experience is a vital component that can make all the difference to a young persons CV as they continue their journey towards work. 

""The Government Work Experience programme has created over two thousand placements in Scotland since last April. As a direct outcome of today's event I would like to ask employers to help me create a further 500 Work Experience placements.""

"ScotRail, the primary rail operator in Scotland, has agreed to introduce the Jobcentre Plus Travel Discount card onto its network from 1 April 2012. Eligible Jobcentre Plus claimants will be able to obtain a 50% discount on rail travel on ScotRail services within Scotland.

ScotRail will adopt the Association of Train Operating Companies (ATOC) eligibility rules. In addition, as a result of ScotRail's more generous funding agreement, claimants in Scotland will be able to access discounts earlier - after three months unemployment - and will be able to retain the card when participating in the Work Programme.  Claimants in England and Wales have to wait six months before becoming eligible.

These concessions from the standard scheme give significant extra help to jobseekers in Scotland.

The formal Memorandum of Understanding between Scotrail and Jobcentre Plus was signed at Dundee railway station, prior to the National Convention on Youth Employment in Dundee on 15 March 2012.

Jobcentre Plus provides the administration and funding of the cards and application forms. The card is issued to claimants at advisers' discretion to support return to work, job interviews and training.

Steve Montgomery, the managing director of ScotRail said: "" We are happy to support this initiative because it reduces the financial burden on people who are looking for work.""

The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore said: ""This is an excellent and generous ScotRail initiative which will give practical support to those looking for work. We need to do all we can to help people into employment and discounted rail travel will  make it easier to attend interviews and seek out opportunities.""

Richard Cornish, DWP Work Services Director in Scotland, said: ""I'm delighted we've reached this agreement between Jobcentre Plus in Scotland and Scotrail which will enable claimants in Scotland to widen their jobsearch by reducing the cost of rail travel.""

The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore said:

""These figures reflect the challenging economic climate. They are a strong reminder that getting people into work is our first priority, especially as the Scottish unemployment rate remains above the rest of the UK.

""We are doing all we can to get Scotland working. The UK Government is laying the foundations for more sustainable growth in Scotland and creating the conditions for businesses to invest in good quality jobs.

""Our primary goal is to get young people into employment and tomorrow I will chair the first National Convention on Youth Employment in Dundee. We will bring together Ministers from both the UK and Scottish Governments with public and private sector organisations to work together for the benefit of our young people in Scotland.

""We also want to support our unemployed young people and this is why the Government is introducing a Youth Contract worth almost £1bn over the Spending Review Period.

""Scotland has also benefited from nation-wide investments in high quality infrastructure to the tune of over £430 million pounds which will help Scotland remain competitive.""

"The UK Government today announced that Perth has become one of the UK's new cities after being awarded formal city status as part of the Diamond Jubilee Civic Honours competition.

Perth, already known as the ""fair city"" locally, made a successful bid and has received the honour as part of a process marking Her Majesty The Queen's 60 years on the British throne.

Welcoming the news, the Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore said:

""Today's announcement of its city status is great news for the people who live there, for Perthshire and for Scotland as a whole. The city has a strong heritage and a vibrant culture and will continue to thrive under it new status. It is a great honour for Scotland and is a fitting way to mark the Diamond Jubilee here. I congratulate those who worked hard on the bid for making the case so strongly.""

The Scotland Office minister David Mundell was in Perth as the award was announced and met the Provost of Perth this morning.

He said:

""Perth has been at the heart of Scottish life for over 800 years and city status is also a recognition of Scotland¿s continuing place at the heart of the United Kingdom. I was glad to be able to be in Perth on the day of the announcement and see first-hand the welcome the news received. It is a fitting recognition of Perth's status, both in Scotland and as part of the UK.""

"UK Government Ministers will be in Perth on Tuesday for a National Convention which aims to put the Big Society at the heart of Scottish life.

The Scotland Office Minister David Mundell and Nick Hurd, the UK Government's Minister for Civil Society, will be at the Dewar's Centre for a Big Society National Roundtable event. It will bring government and representatives from public and voluntary sector organisations, charities and social enterprises together to discuss ways to deliver a stronger Scottish society.

The national roundtable is the culmination of a series of visits around Scotland, including Edinburgh, Glasgow, Peterhead, Cumbernauld, Girvan, which David Mundell used to discuss the benefits of community empowerment.

Delegates in Perth will also hear about the opportunities Big Society Capital - the financial institution which supports organisations that invest in the social sector - may present for further investment in social enterprises, charities, voluntary and community organisations in Scotland. A representative of Big Society Capital will speak at the event.

Speaking ahead of the conference, David Mundell said:

""I support and admire what so many public-spirited Scots are doing in their communities. I have seen and hear about projects and enterprises which are prospering on the Big Society's three pillar of community empowerment, reforming our public services and encouraging greater social action.

""Government can help enable and encourage the long-standing tradition of community engagement in Scotland - but ultimately this is about people, about communities and about working for the good of both ourselves and those around us.

""It is fitting that we are meeting in Perth, the very heart of Scotland. That is where the values of the Big Society must sit and I am looking forward to speaking  to the varied organisations who are helping to deliver a stronger society in Scotland.""

David Mundell will also visit Newburgh Community Trust on Tuesday morning, a registered charity organisation which aims to work alongside other community groups and agencies to protect and improve Newburgh for the good of the local people, both present and future.

He will take a short tour of the site and have the opportunity to meet with people who have been affected directly by the work of the Community Trust to hear first hand the positive affects it has had on their lives.

"The Business Secretary Vince Cable announced today (8 March) that the first ever UK Green Investment Bank (GIB) will be based in Edinburgh and London.

The headquarters of the GIB will be located in Edinburgh, with the GIB's main transaction team based in London. This arrangement will enable a greater commercial reach nationally than could be achieved from one location.

Sitting the bank across these two locations will enable the GIB to become a world leader, playing to the strengths of Edinburgh and London.

Business Secretary Vince Cable said: ""Harnessing the strengths of Edinburgh and London will support the Green Investment Bank's ambition to become a world leader. Edinburgh has a thriving green sector and respected expertise in areas such as asset management. London, as the world's leading financial centre, will ensure that the GIB's transaction team can hit the ground running.

""This decision will allow the GIB to operate effectively and achieve its mission of mobilising the additional investment needed to accelerate the UK's transition to a green economy.""

Scottish Secretary Michael Moore welcomed the news, commenting: ""I am delighted that the Green Investment Bank will be headquartered in Edinburgh. Scotland has enormous green energy potential and its capital is the UK's second biggest financial centre. 

""The size and scale of the UK's single energy market ensures the level of investment that will unlock Scotland's renewables future, providing sustainable and affordable green energy across the UK.  It makes perfect sense to have a GIB presence there.

""By basing the GIB's corporate HQ, asset management and administrative functions in Edinburgh and its transaction team in London, we can harness expertise across the country to deliver a strong and successful GIB for the UK.""

The next step for the GIB is the recruitment of the Chair and Senior Independent Director so that it will be in a position to be fully operational this Autumn, subject to state aid approval for the GIB. The GIB is expected to employ 50-70 full time equivalent staff across the two sites.

An assessment of the applications from 32 locations across the UK found that Edinburgh and London were the two leading candidates. The decision document, together with all the submissions from the 32 locations that put in a bid to host the Green Investment Bank (GIB), can be found at [www.bis.gov.uk/giblocation](http://www.bis.gov.uk/giblocation)

The criteria for deciding on a location said that it should:

- be able to recruit and retain the specialist staff needed to run the organisation;   
- enable the GIB to work closely with other parties involved in deals as well as other investment bodies, project developers and green technology providers, and;    
- ensure that the GIB is cost effective.

-The GIB is designed to accelerate private sector investment in the UK's transition to a green economy. Offshore wind power generation, commercial and industrial waste processing and recycling, energy from waste generation, non-domestic energy efficiency and support for the Green Deal will be the first priority sectors for the GIB, subject to approval by the European Commission.

- The Government is committed to setting the UK firmly on course towards a green and growing economy. The transition to a green economy presents significant growth opportunities for UK-based businesses, both at home and abroad. This progression requires unprecedented investment in key green sectors. An estimated investment of up to £200 billion in the energy system alone is needed over the period to 2020. The GIB will be uniquely placed to facilitate the transition to a green economy base by addressing the market failures affecting green infrastructure projects.  These failures have led to significant under investment in the key areas required to deliver this transition. Capitalised with £3 billion, the GIB will complement other green policies to help accelerate additional capital in green infrastructure.

"Commenting on the Scottish Government's publication of the Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland 2010-2011 (GERS) figures today, the Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore said:

""The figures once again show there are great benefits to being part of the United Kingdom. You only have to look at the £15.5 billion which the UK Government spent on social protection and welfare last year as an example of the security of spending the people of Scotland rely on. That figure is worth double the oil and gas revenue alone.

""It is also encouraging to see revenues rising once again after a couple of very difficult years.

""Scotland is an integral part of the UK and also benefits from the UK-wide spending on the wider economy - including the essential stabilisation of the banking system, deficit reduction, quantitative easing and other projects led by the UK Government.

""There is little point in the Scottish Government saying Scotland's finances are stronger than the UK's - that relies on a number of omissions and fails to take account of the interwoven nature of the UK's spending. Scotland is thankfully not separate from the UK's public sector spending and it is up to those seeking independence to explain what the benefits of leaving a system which equally shares risk and reward would be.

""They must also explain what Scotland's net fiscal deficit, even including the oil and gas revenues, would mean for much-vaunted policies such as an oil fund.  It seems obvious to say that you cannot create an oil fund from money which does not exist.""

"The Edinburgh-headquartered Mercy Corps was today confirmed by the UK Government's International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell as one of the top organisations specialising in disaster response to be selected for a new UK rapid response network. It means the charity will be among those able to respond quicker as part of the UK Government's response to major crises across the world.

The network, called the Rapid Response Facility, will mobilise life saving support in the critical hours following a humanitarian disaster, improving the UK's response to major international crises, such as famine, floods and earthquakes.

Following a disaster, equipment, experts and vital aid are too often tied up with paperwork, rather than being immediately deployed, International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell said.

The new system allows the UK's top organisations with extensive experience in disaster response to access funding within hours, thereby reaching affected people faster and saving more lives.

Mercy Corps' teams of experts have decades of experience responding to humanitarian emergencies. The organisation helped more than 1.5 million people survive the drought and famine that hit the Horn of Africa last year. Teams in Somalia, Kenya and Ethiopia responded with a whole range of assistance, including clean water for almost 500,000 people, food and treatment for 42,000 malnourished children and emergency cash to allow 26,000 families to buy the essentials they needed to survive.

The new facility will have a game-changing impact on Mercy Corps' ability to deliver aid in the critical hours and days after a disaster, said Executive Director Mervyn Lee. It will enable the organisations' experts to get life-saving help to affected communities faster, and focus on aid delivery rather than paperwork and sourcing funding.

The new Rapid Response Facility will be activated in the event of a future large scale humanitarian crisis. Mercy Corps along with the other UK charities and businesses selected will be approached within hours, enabling them to get aid to affected people in the critical first 72 hours following a disaster.

UK International Development Secretary, Andrew Mitchell said:

""Mercy Corps is one of the very best performing disaster response agencies and plays a critical role in the UK's life-saving work to help people struck by disaster.  The UK is a world leader in this field and I'm glad Mercy Corps is part of this crucial next step with the UK government. 

""We need our best experts, equipment and aid on the ground as quickly as possible after a disaster, not tied up in red tape.  They need to be able to do their job in that vital window of 72 hours, to save as many lives as possible.

Mervyn Lee, Executive Director of Mercy Corps' European Headquarters in Edinburgh said:

""We know from years of experience that acting quickly saves lives and every day counts. The Rapid Response Facility will help us get essentials like clean water, emergency supplies and health treatment to those who need them within days rather than weeks. And by being on the ground from the very beginning we can help communities not only survive the immediate crisis they face, but to recover and have the chance to rebuild their lives for the long term too.""

"It is vitally important for the Scotch  Whisky industry to continue having  the ""high platform"" of a wide global reach offered by the United Kingdom, the Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore said today.

In a speech to the Scotch Whisky Association (SWA) Members' Day in Edinburgh the Minister said the sector's recent successes in exports - which have increased in value by 23% in the last year - benefited from the UK's worldwide network of trade contacts and diplomacy.

He said these provided an essential channel for Scotch  Whisky, alongside many other Scottish industries, as it meant they had access to support from 2,500 UKTI staff and advisers, including those in embassies, high commissions, consulates and trade offices around the world. There are over 150 UKTI overseas offices in around 100 markets, covering 98% of world GDP.

Moore told the event the ""export success you are currently seeing is hard won, and there remain future battles to break down trade barriers in key markets to ensure even greater long-term success.""

The Minister, who helped promote Scotch whisky on a trade visit to Brazil last year, said the UK Government was working closely with the industry to support its success.

He said: ""The UK Government has the experience and clout to influence important discussions and decisions of direct relevance to the whisky industry: international trade negotiations, the reform of the CAP and international environmental agreements to name but a few.""

He added that the UK Government had worked with the SWA and other key representatives from the food and drink industry to develop the UK's Food and Drink Export Action Plan. He said it set out targeted actions to help exporters use the UK's influence to make the most of the huge global opportunities available.

Moore said:

""The UK provides a global network of immense value to business and industry and a high platform from which Scotland projects its interests around the world. The nations of our country exert more influence by standing together, in partnership, on the world stage. By pulling together - and pooling our resources and talents - we achieve so much more."" 

Gavin Hewitt, Chief Executive of the Scotch Whisky Association, said: ""We are delighted the Secretary of State for Scotland accepted our invitation to address a gathering of representatives from the Scotch Whisky industry at our Members' Day in our Centenary year. Mr Moore's participation is further recognition of the significance of the Scotch Whisky industry to the UK economy. The industry contributes £134 a second to the UK balance of trade.

"A straight, single ""yes or no"" question in the independence referendum is the only way to give voters a clear choice and get a result which everyone can accept, the Scotland Office Minister David Mundell said today (Tuesday 24 April).

The Minister's comment came after the elections expert Ron Gould, who authored the report into the voting problems which occurred at the 2007 Holyrood election, told the BBC a two-question referendum would ""muddy the waters"" for voters. Mr Gould said a result based on two questions would make the result ""very hard to determine"".

David Mundell said the comments showed there was an urgent need for clarity on the way the referendum would be run and urged the Scottish Government to accept the simplicity of a single question which would produce a definitive result.

 The UK Government's consultation on the referendum showed 75 per cent in favour of a single question. The consultation also showed 70 per cent of respondents wanted the referendum to be held sooner rather than later.

 The UK and Scottish Governments and all main political parties have already expressed a preference for a single question referendum.

 Mr Mundell said:

 ""The main point of Ron Gould's report on the 2007 election was that the voter had to come first. That is what Scotland wants and what the UK Government is recommending through a single question which will give voters certainty on what their choice in the referendum means.

""The two question approach is both confusing and unnecessary, especially when it comes to a decision this important for Scotland. We need a single question ballot sooner rather than later and we need a result which everyone can agree accurately reflects the will of the people of Scotland.

""We simply cannot risk a situation where, because of a muddled multi-question ballot paper, we end up with a disputed result which is ""not proven"".

""We find ourselves in a position where there is cross-party agreement that a single question is the preference. There are no excuses for not making a decision on this as soon as possible.""

If, as expected, the Bill receives final approval by the UK Parliament and Royal Assent next week, the transfer of policy powers to Holyrood could happen two months after Royal Assent. 

The Scotland Bill contains the largest ever transfer of powers to the Scottish Parliament. The multi-billion pound tax and borrowing powers will start to be phased in from 2013 onwards when new capital borrowing powers take effect. Policy powers can be transferred from Westminster to Holyrood as early as this summer.

Scotland Office Minister David Mundell said:

""Next week should see the UK Parliament approve the largest ever transfer of powers to Holyrood, and follows the unanimous vote on the legislation in the Scottish Parliament yesterday.

""This Government committed itself to giving more powers to the Scottish Parliament and we are on the verge of fulfilling that commitment to the people of Scotland.

""That would mean that instead of debating what new powers Holyrood could have or should have that MSPs will need to debate what they are actually going to do with these new powers.  That will be a refreshing change. The new policy powers can be transferred as early as this summer so Holyrood will need to make some important decisions in the near future.

""Are we going to have the drink drive limit cut in Scotland? What will this mean for drivers? How soon should this happen? 

""Will air weapons be banned in Scotland? Will legislation be brought forward at the earliest opportunity?

""I expect the Scottish Government have already been working on these policy areas and we will see evidence of that shortly.

""If our Bill is approved by both  Parliaments in the next two weeks then it will be rewarding for all those involved to see Holyrood getting on with using the new powers that so many argued for.""

"Unemployment in Scotland fell by 12,000, to 219,000 in the period December to February 2012, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) data released today.

The Scottish unemployment rate is 8.1 per cent, below the UK average of 8.3 per cent. The labour market statistics also show employment in Scotland has increased by 17,000 over the three months to December to February 2012. The number of those in employment in Scotland now stands at 2,484,000.

  
The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore said:

 ""Today's figures show an encouraging drop in unemployment and are welcome news, not least for the people who have secured work over the last quarter. We can be hopeful this is a sign that the Scottish labour market is stabilising, but there is clearly still a big challenge ahead to bring down unemployment and get more people back into jobs. We still have a lot of work to do and there is absolutely no room for complacency.

""While these are challenging times for the economy, the UK Government is doing all it can to create the right conditions for businesses to create long-lasting jobs. Our policies are helping to stabilise the economy and maintain confidence as we reduce the deficit and create growth.

""We have also made youth unemployment a priority and  have taken significant steps to pull together with organisations across Scotland to remove the barriers to getting young people into work. The National Convention I recently chaired in Dundee was a key step forward in our shared efforts and provided a strong base from which to continue that work.""

* Employment in Scotland rose by 17,000 over the quarter, and rose by 6,000 over the year to stand at 2,484,000.

* The Scots employment rate rose over the quarter to 71.3 per cent. The rate is above the UK average of 70.4 per cent.

* Unemployment in Scotland decreased by 12,000 over the quarter and rose by 4,000 over the year.  The level now stands at 219,000.

* At 8.1 per cent, the Scots unemployment rate is now below the UK rate as a whole which stands at 8.3%.

* Economic Activity rose by 6,000 over the quarter and now stands at 2,704,000. The Economic Activity rate remained unchanged over the quarter to remain at 77.7 per cent.

* In March 2012, the number of people out of work and claiming Jobseeker¿s Allowance (JSA) was 143,800.

"Tightening the law on the criminal liability of partnerships and reforming the law on unincorporated associations will be the dual focus of a UK Government consultation launched today (Tuesday 17 April).

The Government is seeking views on proposals put forward by the Scottish Law Commission.

Reforming the criminal liability of partnerships in Scots law was suggested after the tragedy of the Rosepark nursing home fire in Lanarkshire in 2004 in which 14 residents lost their lives.

The case against the care home operators failed in the courts because of a loophole which prevented the prosecution of a partnership once it had been dissolved.

The proposed change  would ensure all Scottish partnerships could be held to account if they commit crimes and prevent them escaping prosecution for potentially serious offences by dissolving.

The consultation will also look at a separate issue of attributing legal personality to non-profit making unincorporated associations where they meet certain statutory criteria.

Without this reform, a member of a charity, club or other unincorporated association could find themselves held personally liable for someone injured at an event it has organised, for an act for which they are not personally culpable, exposing them to personal financial risk.

The Commission's proposals would provide organisations with limited liability to ensure individual members or office-bearers could not be held personally liable for any damage or offence caused by the organisation as a whole.

The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore said:

""There is an urgent need to ensure that we end the loophole that led to the failure of prosecutions following the Rosepark tragedy. This must not be allowed to happen again. It is not right that partnerships are able to avoid criminal proceedings  by dissolving.

""The second measure would restrict the liability of individuals in unincorporated associations. It is not fair that someone who gives their time to the management of a club or association should be held personally - and financially - responsible for an accident or injury which happens at one of its events. We believe that should be the responsibility of the organisation as a whole and are consulting on the best way to remove this risk and ensure individuals who help manage clubs or voluntary associations are protected.

""We believe these two proposals are sensible and sound steps forward for Scots law.""

The consultation was announced by the Secretary of State in a written ministerial statement to Parliament this morning.

The government is now considering whether to implement the proposals based on the Scottish Law Commission¿s work, which led to a report and draft Bill in 2009 on unincorporated associations and a report and draft Bill in 2011 in the law on criminal liability of dissolved Scottish partnerships.

It is seeking views on the issues.  The Scottish Law Commission has indicated it supports the process and will continue to work with the UK Government to finalise a Bill.

The Consultation closes on 2 July 2012.

"Commenting on the news Diageo plans to invest £1 billion in whisky production across Scotland, including major expansion across its distilleries and warehousing, the Secretary of State for Scotland said it was a ""huge boost for the industry"".

Michael Moore said:

""This investment is a sign of the commercial success of the whisky industry and I welcome the fact it will create hundreds of jobs in Scotland.

""The rise in global demand for our national drink is a result of the sector's quality and expertise in finding new markets and this investment will ensure whisky continues to make a significant contribution to the Scottish economy and employment.

""The UK Government has played a key role in supporting the industry, from working to provide geographical indication protection for the product in countries around the world to providing the support of 2,500 UKTI staff and advisers in countries around the world. The UK's network of trade contracts across the world is invaluable to the whisky industry and we shall continue to give them the support it needs to continue its remarkable success.""

There are over 150 UKTI overseas offices in 100 markets around the world, covering 98 % of world GDP. UKTI has 2,500 staff and advisers, including those in embassies, high commissions, consulates and trade offices around the world.

"A giant set of Olympic rings was unveiled in Glasgow today as the city became the latest around the UK to to be decorated with the iconic symbol of the Games.

The 10m wide 5m tall stainless steel sculpture has been installed in George Square in the city centre and will form a backdrop for a series of Olympic celebrations in Glasgow this summer.

The rings were unveiled by ten primary school pupils from the city in a ceremony attended by Glasgow City Council leader Councillor Gordon Matheson and Sir Craig Reedie, the former chairman of the British Olympic Association (BOA) and representative of both the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG).

Glasgow will be a focal point for celebrations during the Olympic and Paralympic Games this summer and will stage an evening festival in George Square when the Olympic Torch reaches the city on Friday 8 June as part of the ten week Olympic Torch Relay through Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

The city has already been gearing up for its role as a host for eight of the Olympic football tournament matches and has been decorated with nearly 6km of bunting and 700 specially made banners and flags to give it the Olympic look and feel.

The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore said:

""The reception to the Olympics has been incredible so far and is growing day by day as we get closer to the start of the Games. It is going to be a great event for the whole of the UK and Glasgow as it hosts Olympic football as well as training camps for athletes from around the world. The torch route is going to take the spirit of the games through the communities of Scotland and I am looking forward to the flame arriving here next week.""

George Square is the latest of several eye-catching sites where giant sets of Olympic rings have been installed. The first was at St Pancras railway station in London in March 2010 and has been followed by others at the entrance to the Channel Tunnel in Calais, in flowers at Kew Gardens, at Birmingham airport and on the River Thames in London and outside the city halls in Cardiff and Belfast. More will be unveiled in Edinburgh, Newcastle, Coventry, Surrey and Weymouth in the coming weeks.

"Helping Scottish firms to manufacture, compete in global markets and increase their exports is a key aim for the UK Government and one which will help the economy stabilise and grow, the Secretary of State for Scotland said today (Wednesday 30 May).

Michael Moore continued his tour of Scottish businesses with a visit to Falkirk-based Alexander Dennis Limited (ADL), the UK's Britain's biggest bus and coach manufacturer and the biggest British-owned company in the country's automotive sector.

This week, the Minister has been visiting firms across Scotland to hear about the issues facing firms and talking about the steps the UK Government is taking to support business and rebalance the economy. 

The visit highlights the role of the automotive industry in the UK, a sector which leads in many areas of manufacturing and  provides 135,000 direct jobs and contributes around £10 billion to the UK economy.

More than 40 companies manufacture vehicles in the UK - ranging from global car makers, van, truck and bus builders, to specialist firms. In addition, eight out of the 12 Formula 1 teams are based in the UK. The UK's ""Motorsport Valley"" employs over 25,000 world-class engineers, while more than 15 universities offer motorsport engineering and management degrees.

Alexander Dennis Limited is a world leader in the development and manufacture of lightweight, fuel efficient, environment-friendly buses and its vehicles form the backbone of double deck fleets across the world. It is also Europe's leading supplier of low-carbon hybrid electric buses and has three principal manufacturing sites in the UK - its HQ facility in Falkirk; at Scarborough in North Yorkshire; and at Guildford, in Surrey.

Speaking after the visit, Michael Moore said:

""I have been impressed by the scope, innovation and diversity of the businesses I have met so far this week. Scotland has a huge range of skills and experience to draw from and our ability to find new markets both at home and abroad.

""Companies such as Alexander Dennis Ltd are a great example of a firm making the most of having facilities across the UK to support its domestic and international trade. That supports 2000 jobs directly and 5000 indirectly and is helping the economy grow at the same time.

""The UK Government has taken action to help support the auto industry, an essential industry sector. The UK provides the platform, reach and expertise needed for its success. This government will continue to support it as we work to rebalance the economy and secure future growth.""

"The news that Scottish companies have secured contracts worth over £30 million as a result of the London 2012 Olympic Games was welcomed by the Secretary of State for Scotland today.

The latest figures from the UK Government show thirty firms have won business worth £30,843,048 as a result of the Olympics coming to the UK.

Michael Moore said the news showed Scotland was set to benefit economically from the Games as companies and suppliers provided goods and services across a range of sectors.

Speaking after visits to businesses in and around Glasgow, the Minister said:

""As we get ever closer to the spectacle of the Games, it is good to see that Scotland's economy is also benefitting as a result of firms winning contracts.  Although the Olympics are being hosted in London, we are determined that Scotland does not miss out.

""There are many benefits to Scotland which come from the Games, and related activity such as tourism will help boost the economy further.

""The reception across the UK has been incredible so far and next week I will meet the Olympic flame as it arrives in Scotland before making its way around the country..

"The future success of Scotland's renewables sector is best served by  partnering the country's natural resource to the support offered by being part of the UK, the Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore said today.

The Minister was speaking after a visit to the Islay Energy Trust as part of a countrywide tour to meet real Scots who are working hard to create jobs for their own communities. The Islay Energy Trust is a community-owned organisation that aims to develop renewable energy projects for the benefit of the community whilst reducing Islay's carbon footprint.  The Sound of Islay has  been identified as having one of the best tidal resources in the UK. Recently the Trust announced a new Tidal Energy Project, a world-first tidal array that will have the capacity to generate 10MW of electricity, the annual power usage on the islands of Islay and Jura.

The Secretary of State said:

""I have been very impressed by the project I have seen on Islay. There is no doubt Scotland has a wealth of renewable resource, including tidal, and the UK Government is helping to deliver the next generation of energy provision as part of a balanced mix.

""The key challenge is turning our potential into a commercial reality and I believe the best way to do that is within the UK, given the access to a broader consumer base and the help we are providing the sector. In this case, as in so many others, we really can achieve far more together than apart.""

Following the introduction of the Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult in February, the visit reinforces the UK government's commitment to renewable energy through:

-       providing financial support for the renewables industry;

-       working with stakeholders to remove barriers to delivery of new projects;

-       aiding development of technology and innovation. 

It is estimated that the UK has around 50 percent of Europe's tidal energy resource, and harnessing tidal and wave energy has huge potential.

Generating energy from the power of waves or tides could provide up to 20 percent of current UK electricity demand and also help cut carbon emissions and support thousands of UK jobs. To help encourage further private investment in renewables, the UK Government has also created the UK Green Investment Bank, which will have its headquarters in Edinburgh and a transaction team in London. The UK GIB will provide funding for new renewable energy projects throughout the country and is one of a number of key policies designed help meet environmental objectives and promote long-term sustainable economic growth.

"The news today (Monday  28 May) that the Forth Bridge is one of two new sites recommended to go forward as the UK's next World Heritage nominations has been welcomed by the Secretary of State for Scotland.

The Forth Bridge can now prepare a nomination for 2014. The Gorham's Cave Complex in Gibraltar will go forward in 2015.

The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore said:

""The Forth Bridge is an iconic symbol of Scotland which is instantly recognised the world over and is a huge feat of Scottish engineering skill. It was nominated for UNESCO World Heritage Status by the UK Government last year and the fact it has topped the list and can now take its bid forward is good news for Scotland.""

Earlier this year the UK submitted to UNESCO a Tentative List of 11 sites that could be future World Heritage nominations. Those sites which felt ready to go forward straight away were invited to submit a Technical Evaluation, which was assessed by an independent Expert Group. Four sites came forward and the Expert Group recommended the Forth Bridge and Gorham's Cave Complex should go first and second.

Once the sites' nominations have been submitted, they will undergo a demanding 18 month process of scrutiny and evaluation by UNESCO and its advisory body, the International Council on Monuments and Sites. UNESCO's World Heritage Committee is expected to take the final decision on the Forth Bridge in June 2015 and on Gorham's Cave Complex in 2016.

The UK currently has 28 World Heritage sites, spread across all four nations of the UK, and a number of UK Overseas Territories.

"Three Scottish cities are being urged to seize the opportunity to  become a Super-Connected City and revolutionise the way their residents and businesses get online.  
   
The UK Government announced earlier this month that Aberdeen, Dundee and Perth are eligible to bid for a share of a £50 million funding pot designed to help them roll out ultrafast-broadband.   
   
This is the second round of funding available, with ten UK cities, including Edinburgh, already working on detailed plans to upgrade their networks.   
   
The UK Department for Culture, Media and Sport has today (25 May) published guidance on the bidding process for the second tranche of funding, and cities must produce plans for a contiguous area offering fixed ultrafast broadband as well as high speed wireless connectivity.

The Secretary of State for Scotland has encouraged the three Scottish cities to apply and join the capital in providing ultrafast broadband access to businesses and homes.   
   
Michael Moore said:   
   
""This is a fantastic opportunity for these cities to reap the benefits that could come from achieving Super-Connected status.   
   
""Access to ultrafast broadband means businesses can expand, develop new markets and compete with others around the world.  It also allows local communities to access public services more quickly and efficiently online.  
   
""Providing Scotland  with high-speed broadband is essential for businesses to grow and to create the new jobs we need. That is why the UK Government believes broadband is essential not only for everyday life, but also for the future economic success of the UK.  
   
""I am encouraging Aberdeen, Dundee and Perth to submit the most robust bids possible and seize the opportunity to add further Scottish cities to the super-connected roster.""

 Ofcom defines superfast broadband as above 24Mbps.  For the Super-Connected Cities programme, ultrafast means speeds as close to 80-100Mbps as is currently possible.  Ultrafast includes technologies, principally fibre to the cabinet (FTTC), that are capable of up to 80Mbps and are ultimately up-gradable to 100Mbps or more.

His comments came after a YouGov poll showed a clear majority of Scots remain opposed to independence.

Moore said:

""The UK Government has worked hard to create the right environment to foster confidence in the sector and this record level of interest is proof positive those efforts are working.

""This is good news for the future of the North Sea and for the thousands of jobs it supports. The changes we made in the Budget, which strengthen certainty around issues such as tax and decommissioning costs, have helped give the industry the stability it needs to plan future investment and support jobs in Scotland.""

""The publication of the consultation responses clearly demonstrates the quality of the argument from all quarters of Scotland for a referendum which is legal, fair and decisive.

""Since launching our consultation in January we have made a good deal of progress with the Scottish Government. We both agree that a Section 30 Order should be used to enable Holyrood to legislate for an independence referendum. We both agree that the Electoral Commission must have a role to play in reviewing the question.

""Both Governments can take satisfaction from the quality of the arguments supporting our shared preference for a single question. A range of business leaders, academics and members of the public make a very persuasive case for asking one clear question.  There is much in the quality of the arguments being made that both I and the First Minister can take heart from.

""There is also  strong support behind the case for holding the referendum sooner than the Scottish Government's proposed date of Autumn 2014. I have indicated that the timing of the referendum should not be a barrier to us agreeing the referendum process and moving on to the real debate. I hope the First Minister will agree that we should get on with sorting this.""

"Keeping costs low for Scottish consumers and putting them in control of their energy bills should be a key aim for suppliers, the second Scotland Office Energy Summit heard today (Thursday 17 May).

The event, held in Rutherglen, brought together the ""Big Six"" energy companies, consumer groups and the UK and Scottish Governments as well as the industry regulator Ofgem.

It was chaired by the Scotland Office Minister David Mundell and builds on the work of the first Scottish summit which was held by Michael Moore in October.

As rising energy costs continue to put pressure on domestic budgets across the country, the Summit provides a forum for the energy industry and organisations to discuss ways to reduce prices and identify ways to make tariffs simpler to understand so consumers can choose the best deal. The Summit also has a focus on energy efficiency measures for households, emphasising the range of steps people can take to save energy in their homes.

The Summit heard that the UK Government was building on its policies - such as the Warm Home Discount Scheme - by bringing forward further initiatives such as the Green Deal and the Energy Company Obligation.

The energy suppliers presented a summary of the work they had undertaken since the last Summit. Consumer groups gave an update of their activity in terms of identifying gaps and problem areas and officials from the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change explained the details of the Warm Home Discount and other policies as well as work on the inclusion of hard-to-reach consumers such as the over 65s. .

The Scotland Office Minister David Mundell said:

""The Summit is a unique chance to bring together the energy companies, consumer groups and Scotland's two governments to tackle the issues of rising bills and fuel poverty. These are serious issues and we are making good progress as we work towards a simpler and cheaper system for Scottish households and families.

""This Government wants people to be paying as little as possible for their energy  and, while we can't control volatile global prices, we can look at the best ways to get the lowest possible tariff and also save as much energy as we can.

""The UK Government has already launched a number of policies designed to help, which shows how seriously we take this issue.

""I am very grateful for everyone who took part in the Summit and the spirit in which they looked constructively at the issues and are working towards solution. The energy companies are playing their part alongside consumer groups and government and I am certain we can continue to work towards the best deal for people across Scotland"".

"Unemployment in Scotland fell by 10,000, to 221,000 in the period January to March 2012, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) data released today. The Scottish unemployment rate is 8.2 per cent, which is equal to the average for the whole of the UK.

The labour market statistics also show employment in Scotland has increased by 24,000 over the three months to January to March 2012. The number of those in employment in Scotland now stands at 2,482,000.

The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore said:

 ""The further fall in Scottish unemployment is encouraging and another step towards getting our economy back on track. It follows a similar fall last month and is a positive sign that people are continuing to find work. That is good news for people and families across the country.

""We still face difficult economic circumstances but taking action to tackle the deficit and create growth is helping create the confidence and stability we need to create and sustain jobs.

""We are also focusing on youth unemployment which is currently higher in Scotland than the rest of the UK. We cannot afford to let up on our efforts in this area and I continue to work across government and with the relevant organisations to find ways to overcome the barriers facing our young people.

""I am also encouraging the Scottish Government to use some of the £1 billion of extra funding it has received since the Spending Review to fund its list of ""shovel-ready"" projects. We have already brought forward the means to help with major projects such as the Forth Replacement Crossing and there is nothing to stop the Scottish Government using its extra budget to back the projects it has identified.""

"The Scottish Secretary Michael Moore has written to the First Minister Alex Salmond to propose they meet for the next stage of their talks on how Scotland's two governments can work together and deliver a legal, fair and decisive referendum.

The UK Government's own consultation on the referendum ended in March and Mr Moore said that with both consultations now closed the time was right for constructive talks to resume.

The Scottish Secretary said he was confident an agreement could be reached.

Mr Moore said:

""The Scottish Government will want some time to consider the responses it has received, and that is of course right.

""But with both consultations now closed, and so many of the arguments well-aired and understood, I  believe it is right that we resume our discussions in the next few weeks.

""Responses to our own consultation gave strong backing to Scotland's two governments working together to deliver a legal, fair and decisive referendum.  I am confident that we can get that done.

""From my meetings with the First Minister earlier in this process, I know that the Scottish Government is supportive of a Section 30 Order, approved by the UK and Scottish Parliaments, to put the referendum on a sound legal footing. Both governments are also clear that there should be a single question, that the Scottish Parliament franchise should be used, and that the process should be overseen by the Electoral Commission.

""In the four months since I published our referendum consultation there has been a good and healthy debate about the terms on which it should take place.

""But with important matters including the economy and job creation high on the public agenda, Scots now expect their two governments to work positively and constructively to resolve the process issues on the referendum and move on to the great debate on Scotland's future and the vote itself.

""I look forward to sitting down soon with the First Minister and finding a way forward.""

###### Michael Moore visited the Aberdeen-based subsea installation contractor Bibby Offshore in Aberdeen as part of a fact-finding mission on the energy sector in the city in conjunction with Oil & Gas UK. He joined senior representatives from Bibby Offshore,including managing director Fraser Moonie (above), for a tour of Aberdeen harbour and heard how the company has successfully grown both in the UK North Sea and internationally with plans for further expansion. 

The stability and certainty created by the UK Government's policies to support the oil and gas sector has helped the confidence of contractors grow at the fastest rate since 2009 and will provide  further momentum to export skills and expertise around the world, the Secretary of State Michael Moore said today.

The Minister, who was in Aberdeen for a series of industry-related visits, said changes made in the Budget last year and the government's continuing focus on working with the sector were helping to unlock future resources from the North Sea and encourage growth. He also met a delegation from Brazil, one of the fastest growing global economies, to discuss future opportunities for UK firms.  

The UK Government made a number of changes including decommissioning tax relief measures and field allowances.  In the Budget, the Chancellor announced the introduction of a package of oil and gas measures to secure billions of pounds of additional investment in the UK Continental Shelf.

This morning, a survey by the industry body Oil & Gas UK showed confidence rose to its highest level since the first quarter of 2009 among contractors. The news follows an Aberdeen Chamber of Commerce report yesterday which showed  40% of companies surveyed by the Fraser of Allander Institute indicated that the referendum was a factor in future plans and investment proposals.

The discovery of new oil reserves in Brazil means there is a great opportunity for companies based in Scotland to export their wealth of accumulated knowledge and expertise. 

The Secretary of State said:

""The UK Government is using the levers at its disposal to help the oil and gas industry.  Our worldwide network of embassies offers assistance to thousands of companies breaking into new markets.  Our combined economic clout gives us the ability to stimulate investment - through our negotiating power worldwide or through direct measures - such as the $1 billion line of credit guaranteed by UK Export Finance which will enable Petrobras to offer contracts to companies based in Scotland. 

 ""The skills and ingenuity acquired by Scottish workers in the North Sea over the past 40 years are recognised as world-class and they offer a powerful resource for our counterparts im markets around the world - such as Brazil - to tap into.

""It is clear that Brazil's oil and gas sector has entered a unique and exciting time and with Aberdeen and the North Sea's long and successful pedigree of oil and gas exploration, there is a truly fantastic opportunity for companies here in Scotland to export their wealth of accumulated knowledge and expertise.""

"A stronger economy with a better deal for Scottish consumers and families is the focus of the UK Government's legislative programme announced in the Queen's Speech today (Wednesday 9 May).

The Coalition government's founding principle was to reduce the country's record peacetime deficit, to rebalance the economy and to set it back on the path to sustainable growth. Over the past two years, the UK Government has acted to deliver that long-term success.  The content of this Queen's speech builds on that approach.

The 15 Bills - 14 of which will apply to Scotland in full or in part - will also include measures to change the composition of the House of Lords.

The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore said: ""This Queen's speech is a further step towards rebalancing our economy and setting it back on the path to growth.

""The measures here are not just about numbers. They are designed to make life easier for Scotland's consumers and households in these testing times.

""These proposals aim to help Scottish families and individuals who want clean energy at affordable prices and a fair deal for themselves and our farmers when they buy food from the supermarket shelves.  Our proposals will also provide greater security for households by shielding savings as we reform the banking system.

""This government is tackling the major issues across the country. We are clearing up the economic mess we inherited as a government and taking steps to prevent the chance of that ever happening again.  But we are also taking fair and affordable measures to make life better for households across Scotland too.  That commitment lies at the heart of this speech.""

The legislative programme also includes four draft Bills. We will also seek to support a Scottish Law Commission Bill on Unincorporated Associations and Partnerships, which seeks to reform the criminal liability of partnerships in Scots law. The move was suggested after the Rosepark nursing home fire in 2004 and the case against the care home operators failing in the courts because of a loophole which prevented the prosecution of a partnership once it had been dissolved.

Non-legislative measures in the Queen's Speech included a commitment to spend 0.7% of gross national income on international aid from 2013, which would make the UK the first G8 country to meet that target, and the Succession to the Crown.

_**The Legislative Programme**_

Many aspects of life in Scotland will be affected by the measures, including:

In the First Session, 20 Bills were mentioned in the State Opening Speech, including one draft Bill, and 32 main programme Bills received Royal Assent.

"Aberdeen, Dundee and Perth are among twenty seven cities throughout the UK in the running to become ""super-connected"", Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced today.

The cities are able to bid for a share of a £50 million pot to help them roll out ultrafast-broadband, driving growth and attracting new investment.

In the Budget, the Chancellor George Osborne announced the new fund, which will help create around 10 super-connected cities with 80-100Mbps broadband access. This is the second round of funding for ultra-fast broadband, with 10 of our largest cities already working on detailed plans to upgrade their networks. 

The Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport Jeremy Hunt said:

""This is a fantastic opportunity for 27 cities across the country to demonstrate how they'd revolutionise the way their residents and businesses get online.

""These ultrafast speeds will allow another more cities in the UK to compete with the fastest in the world, bringing new opportunities for growth, the development of high tech industries and the transformation of public services.""

The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore said:

""Edinburgh has already been successful in its bid for ultrafast broadband funding and I will be encouraging Aberdeen, Dundee and Scotland's newest city Perth to make strong cases in the next round. The UK Government is making another £50 million of funding available and it is important Scottish cities get their share.

""The UK Government is aiming for the best broadband network in Europe and has already invested hundreds of millions of pounds towards this aim. Faster broadband is key for making Scottish business and investment successful.""

To be able to bid for the fund cities must have a Royal Charter and more than 45,000 homes and businesses, or more than 35,000 homes and businesses in Northern Ireland.

The eligible cities are Aberdeen, Brighton & Hove, Cambridge, Chelmsford, Coventry, Derby, Dundee, Exeter, Gloucester, Kingston upon Hull, Leicester, Londonderry / Derry, Newport, Norwich, Oxford, Perth, Peterborough, Plymouth, Portsmouth, Preston, Salford, Southampton, Stoke-on-Trent, Sunderland, Swansea, Wolverhampton and York.

Bidding cities will need to produce plans for how they will use their share of the £50 million and detailed bidding guidance will be published by 18 May.

Projects will have to include the creation of a contiguous area offering fixed ultrafast broadband of at least 80-100Mbps broadband as well as high speed wireless connectivity.

The fund can only be used to support the roll-out of ultrafast broadband to areas that will not be served by the private sector.

The resources the city proposes to bring to the project ¿ either in funding or other contributions ¿-will be a factor in assessing the bids and there will be a presumption in favour of match funding.

The winning cities will be announced in the Autumn Statement later this year. 

The first round of applications for super-connected status saw the four national capitals and six other cities selected.

The change means the Scottish Government will have to make decisions on how best to use the significant new powers for the benefit of the people of Scotland.
",Scotland Office,Scotland Act 2012 available online,The new Scotland Act brings about the largest ever transfer of financial powers to Scotland since the creation of the UK.,http://www.scotlandoffice.gov.uk/scotlandoffice/17001.html,03 May 2012
"The Scotland Bill received Royal Assent  today (Tuesday 1 May), marking the final part of the process to change the devolution settlement and give more powers to the Scottish Parliament. It comes on the 305th  anniversary of the Act of Union.

The new Scotland Act brings about the largest ever transfer of financial powers to Scotland since the creation of the UK.

The change means the Scottish Government will have to make decisions on how best to use the significant new powers for the benefit of the people of Scotland.

The Bill cleared the final stage at the House of Commons last week, following passage through the Lords. The Scottish Parliament voted unanimously in favour of a legislative consent motion a fortnight ago.

The legislation brings a much higher level of financial accountability to Holyrood as MSPs become responsible for raising more of the money they spend.

It is the end of a significant journey resulting in a historic change to the devolution settlement.  It began with the Commission on Scottish Devolution chaired by Sir Kenneth Calman which started work in April 2008 with the remit of looking at changes to devolution which would allow Holyrood to serve the Scottish people better.

The Commission's recommendations formed the basis of the Scotland Bill, which has been the subject of a wide range of parliamentary scrutiny in both Edinburgh and London.

The Prime Minister David Cameron said:  
   
""I have three priorities for Scotland's constitutional future: to deliver on devolution; to enable a separation referendum to be held which is legal, fair and decisive; and to win that referendum.

""We have kept our promise and delivered the biggest transfer of fiscal powers in 300 years - all done with the agreement of the four major parties in Scotland - and helped to secure a strong and confident Scotland within a strong and confident United Kingdom   
   
""The Scottish Parliament is now more accountable and more responsible than ever before, which is not just good for Scotland but also good for the whole United Kingdom. Now it is time for the Scottish people to recognise all the powers that Holyrood has and join in the debate about how these powers are used.""

The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore said:

""This is a genuinely historic day for devolution and the relationship between Scotland¿s two governments and the people who elect them. The powers being handed over to the Scottish Parliament combine accountability with the ability to make big decisions for the Scottish economy on issues such as the rate of Scottish income tax.

""The new Scotland Act will make the Scottish Parliament responsible for raising around a third of the Scottish budget. It also marks a long period of considered scrutiny which has resulted in a set of new powers that can help Scotland prosper within the United Kingdom. It has been hard and challenging work to deliver these changes for the people of Scotland but it is an essential and positive step for devolution.""

The Scotland Office Minister David Mundell helped take the Scotland Bill through its Commons stages. He said:

""The UK Government has delivered for Scotland today.  The Scottish Parliament already had significant powers, with areas such as health, education and enterprise fully devolved. The Scotland Act will add to those in a sensible and effective way, providing more flexibility within the stability and security of the wider United Kingdom.""

The Advocate General Lord Wallace, who took the Bill through the Lords process, said:

""The significant new powers this legislation will transfer have been subject to rigorous scrutiny at all stages of the Lords process and the subject of strong and, at times, passionate debate. The changes in the Scotland Act are the right ones for Scotland. They are a balanced and strong package of financial powers and other functions which will give the Scottish Parliament more power coupled with more accountability.

""As a member of the Calman Commission, it is particularly satisfying to see those original recommendations become an Act which will benefit the people of Scotland today.""

 The new powers to be included in the new Scotland Act are:

* A new £2.2bn capital borrowing power for the Scottish Parliament, to be in place from April 2015 - with a limited version of the power in place from April 2013 to enable the SG to  fund £100m of pre-payments for the Forth Road Crossing, allowing early work on the Bridge to get underway.

* The power to introduce new taxes, subject to the agreement of the UK Government, from the enactment of the Bill.

* The full devolution of stamp duty land tax and landfill tax, from April 2015.

* Extended current borrowing powers to help manage volatility in tax receipts and the creation of a new Scottish cash reserve to manage the new revenue receipts.

* Scottish Ministers to have powers in relation to the misuse of drugs;

* Scottish Ministers to have powers relating to the administration of elections to the Scottish Parliament;

* Power to regulate air weapons devolved to Scottish Parliament;

* Scottish Ministers to have a role in appointment process for BBC Trust member for Scotland and MG Alba Trust Members;

* Scottish Ministers to have a role in the appointments process for the Crown Estate Commissioner with special responsibility for Scotland;

* Scottish Ministers to have power to set regulations for the drink-drive limit;

* Scottish Ministers to have the power to determine the national speed limit in Scotland;

* Confirming the reservation of the Antarctic;

* Ensuring that the criminal penalties that apply in Scotland Act are updated to reflect the current standards applied in Scottish courts;

* Clauses 34 to 38 of the Bill provide a new appeal right to the Supreme Court for questions raised in Scottish criminal proceedings about compatibility with the Convention or EU law.  The Bill provides for a review of these provisions and a power for the Secretary of State to amend them following the review.  The provisions also provide that the Lord Advocate's actions in prosecuting offences or as head of the criminal prosecution system cannot be ultra vires under the Scotland Act 1998 but can still be unlawful under the Human Rights Act. The Bill provides for a review of these provisions and a power for the Secretary of State to amend them following the review.

""The Government's position is clear. We believe Scotland is stronger in the UK and the UK is stronger with Scotland in it.  Leading up to the referendum the Government will produce detailed evidence and analysis to assess the benefits that Scotland gains from being part of the United Kingdom and the contribution that Scotland makes to our United Kingdom.   
   
""It is right that this debate is fully informed by thorough evidence and analysis to address many of the key questions facing people in Scotland.""

""This work will be a careful and detailed analysis of the benefits to Scotland of being part of the UK.

""It has been a fantastic success and privilege for us to have the Torch in Scotland.  It has been on an amazing journey to all corners of our country and thousands of people have turned out to see it.  The relay has firmly put Scotland on the map as one of the most beautiful places to visit in the world.    
   
""The Torch has also fired people's enthusiasm for the Games. I know that Scottish people are now doubly looking forward to supporting the athletes during the Olympics.""  
   
The Olympic Torch started its journey on the 7 June and spent eight days in Scotland starting in Stranraer.  It has travelled through the Highlands and islands taking in a number of iconic monuments and locations.  It has passed the Robert Burns museum, across the Forth Rail Bridge, Loch Ness and been as far North as Lerwick in the Shetland Islands.    
   
Rt. Hon. Danny Alexander MP, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury continued:    
   
""The Olympic Torch symbolises the spirit of the games and it has been fantastic to have it in Scotland.  The relay has given us an opportunity to showcase our history, heritage, cities, towns, islands and glens to a global audience showing why Scotland continues to be one of the world favourite destinations.    
   
""I enjoyed the celebration with local people at Drumnadrochit and Inverness as we followed the convoy down the shores of Loch Ness.  We can now pass the baton across the border as the countdown to the Olympics continues.""  
   
During its eight day tour of Scotland the Torch was carried by over 700 Torchbearers through more than 120 towns and over 400,000 people turned out to see it.

The Olympics will leave a lasting legacy across the UK and in Scotland.  More than 100 Scottish companies have secured tens of millions of pounds of contracts and 25 have been directly involved in building the park, including supplying utilities for the Olympic Stadium, helping to build the Basketball Arena and providing aggregate for the Aquatics Centre. Many more Scottish firms have picked up other Olympic-related contracts - from producing official Games merchandise to providing temporary power across many of the Games venues.

"UK Government funding is set to help transform research into the renewables sector in Scotland and secure affordable and clean energy for future generations.  
   
The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore told a National Microelectronics Institute (NMI) conference in Glasgow that successful partnering between Scotland's renewable energy and power electronic companies and the UK Government is leading to further growth and innovation in the renewable energy sector.  
   
The Minister was speaking at the University of Strathclyde where £50 million of UK Government funding has been secured towards the Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult. This is in addition to its share of the £140 million funding towards the High Value Manufacturing Catapult.  
   
The Minister said:  
   
""We cannot overstate the importance of the energy revolution - secure, affordable & clean energy is vital to our future and the Government is committed to meeting those goals.  
   
""Both of these facilities are superb examples of Scotland's strengths both in research and development and in the field of renewable energy.  
    
""We must work together across the private sector, academic institutions and in a cooperative partnership between the UK and the Scottish Governments to release the potential of Scotland's renewable energy resources.  
   
""Between April last year and March this year, we have seen announcements totalling £1.7 billion of investment in renewable energy in Scotland, supporting more than 4,400 jobs.  
   
""By continuing to work together as a strong, united country we are best placed to meet the economic and energy challenges we face"".  
   
The Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult will enable UK business to research, test and measure the application of new technologies and materials, building on the strong track record of innovation in offshore renewable energy undertaken in the UK over many years.  It will also help the UK achieve its target of generating 15% of its energy from renewable sources by 2020.  
   
It will establish the strong international links required to facilitate the commercialisation of new technologies and will also forge long-term relationships with the European Commission through active involvement in both its current and future framework programmes.

"The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore today (Tuesday 12 June) confirmed the UK Government will continue to fund an Emergency Towing Vessel for the rest of the Spending Review up to 2015.

A Written Ministerial Statement was laid in Parliament this morning. The news brings a search for a solution to the issue to a successful conclusion and means there will be a vessel on hand to provide cover and assistance to shipping around the coast of Scotland as required.

Month-by-month funding arrangements had been in place to allow the Emergency Towing Vessel Scotland Group look at potential solutions, including commercial call-out options, and that cover will continue until the long-term arrangement is put in place. The procurement process will be launched today.

A change to the previous arrangements will be the vessel being tasked by HM Coastguard to undertake specific escort duties should they consider it necessary, rather than the passive escort of shipping. The government considers this to be the best model available to ensure the best coverage of the waters around Scotland while combining  operational considerations and value for money for the UK taxpayer. 

Options for the optimal stationing of the vessel will be sought from the market, and decisions on operational positioning and tasking will rest with HM Coastguard.

Michael Moore said:

""As a government, we have listened closely to all the views which have been put forward in this process. We have worked hard within the UK Government with the Department for Transport and the Maritime & Coastguard Agency to find the best solution to maintain emergency towing vessel cover within the financial constraints we face.

""Today's announcement show we have found a practical and sensible way forward with a replacement which balances risk and efficiency. I am grateful the local authorities, Harbour Masters and others who have taken part in the process leading up to today's announcement.

""The oil industry has also been active in helping explore the potential of a commercial call-out arrangement using their vessels and discussions are still underway.""

"The people of Scotland have given the Olympic torch relay an ""overwhelming and incredible welcome"" as it begins its route through the country, the Secretary of State for Scotland said today.

Michael Moore said the reaction to the flame, which arrived in Cairnryan from Northern Ireland yesterday evening, showed how the spirit of London 2012 could be felt across every community in Scotland.

The Torch relay will travel over 120 miles from Stranraer to Glasgow on its first day here and be carried by 129 Torchbearers, ending in an evening celebration  in George Square. They included a serving British Army soldier, Olympians and members of the public and the Scottish actor James McAvoy.

The Secretary of State said:

""The response to the Torch relay on its arrival and first day in Scotland has been incredible. No one can doubt the way London 2012 is gripping the imagination of every community across the UK and that spirit is reflected in the turnout and support for the flame everywhere it goes.

""This really is an event for the whole of the UK and the reaction of people in Scotland shows that we are behind the Olympics. With less than 50 days to go, that excitement will continue to build. I am very much looking forward to welcoming the torch in Edinburgh and in the Borders next week and to the start of the Games themselves.""

"The UK Government has announced that it is making available a further £32 million of funding to ensure that Scotland is on track with its plans to deliver superfast broadband.

This funding is in addition to £68.8 million that has already been allocated to Scotland for investment in its broadband network, taking the total to over £100 million. 

Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander said:

""In the modern world, where so much business is done online, it is essential that companies across the UK have access to decent internet connection speeds.

""This additional funding will help ensure that Scotland has the broadband infrastructure it needs to support its tech industries, and businesses and education across the country.""

The Secretary of State Michael Moore said:

""Access to superfast broadband means Scottish businesses can expand, develop new markets and compete globally. It also allows local communities to access public services more quickly and efficiently online

""Providing Scotland with high-speed broadband is essential for businesses to grow and to create the new jobs we need. That is why the UK Government believes broadband is essential not only for everyday life, but also for the future economic success of Scotland and the UK.""

This additional funding will allow many more premises across Scotland to be given superfast connections to the broadband network, including in the Highlands and Islands where the infrastructure is currently less developed and the costs of connecting additional premises are much higher than other parts of the UK.

The Government is committed to delivering the best superfast broadband network in Europe by 2015, with 90 per cent of the UK receiving superfast broadband and everyone else to have access to standard broadband with a speed of at least 2Mbps.

"Today the Government published its decision on the levels of financial support that will be available through the Renewables Obligation (RO) for large-scale renewable electricity generators from 2013-17. Changes to the subsidies for renewable electricity could incentivise £20 - 25bn of new investment in the economy between 2013 and 2017. The Banding Review for the RO will support jobs and deliver more clean power with a reduction in costs to consumers between 2013 and 2015. 

This comes ahead of the Government's Global Investment Conference and series of 17 business summits taking place at the British Business Embassy at Lancaster House during the upcoming Games, which aim to secure further investment into the UK.

The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore welcomed the announcement and said:

""Today's announcement underlines the Government's commitment to two important issues: investment in renewable energy and fair, sustainable energy prices for consumers.

""We are taking positive steps to help attract billions of further investment into green energy in the UK, as part of our energy mix ¿ which includes the UK Green Investment Bank, headquartered in Edinburgh. Those steps will not only create jobs but also benefit consumers by lowering their domestic bills as well as helping us meet our reduction targets.

""Scotland has an important role to play in the future of renewables and we lead the way in many areas. Today's decisions will support the sector here and are both sensible and practical as support is balanced between established and emerging technologies, such as marine. This is good news for  Scotland.""

The Secretary of State for Energy Ed Davey commented:  ""Renewable energy will create a multi-billion pound boom for the British economy, driving growth and supporting jobs across the country.  The support we¿re setting out today will unlock investment decisions, help ensure that rapid growth in renewable energy continues and shows the key role of renewables for our energy security. ""

""Because value for money is vital, we will bring forward more renewable electricity while reducing the impact on consumer bills between 2013 and 2015, saving £6 off household energy bills next year and £5 the year after.""

The tour will include a meeting with the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the Minister of Justice for the Northern Ireland Executive, as well as tours of Belfast City immigration control and a briefing from the team responsible for the oversight of Common Travel Area operations.

In Cairnryan, the Minister will meet interested stakeholders, local politicians and representatives of  Dumfries & Galloway Police for a discussion on a recent UKBA report which reviewed working practices in place to help prevent illegal immigration through the port.

Speaking ahead of the visit, David Mundell said:

""The security of our borders is of paramount importance to all of us and I shall be looking closely at the way the arrangements are working on both the Northern Ireland and Scottish sides.

""Over the past 18  months UKBA and Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary have worked  collaboratively on the policing of Stranraer Ports.  Their combined efforts have ensured that a greater number of illegal immigrants have been intercepted in their attempts to travel onto mainland UK.  That is a good thing which everyone should welcome.  
  
""The key to resolving this issue is working with the Irish Republic to ensure that it is not as attractive for people to come into their country and through the Common Travel Area into the UK. Understandably, the Northern Ireland Executive want to ensure freedom of travel within Ireland as envisaged by the Good Friday Agreement and don¿t want the crossings to another part of the UK turned into an international border.

The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore said:

  
""Growth in the economy - and the jobs that brings - are the key priority for the UK Government. We are working closely with businesses across Scotland and listening to what they have to say because the private and public sector has to tackle this issue together. Today's meeting allowed firms to feed in views to Lord Heseltine's review on competitiveness directly and will ensure Scottish concerns and opportunities are represented fully.

Eighty-five per cent of Diageo's output from Scotland is exported to over 180 markets worldwide. Scotch Whisky remains a strong export commodity for Scotland and the UK and exports continue to grow, with a record shipment value of £4.2 billion last year, up 23% on 2010.

Mr Wilson's role will see him promoting the Scottish economy and business environment in addition to encouraging more firms to engage in international business activities with the view to developing growth in Scottish exports. 

He will continue to contribute to the Scottish Business Board by leading a review of support for Scottish Business Exporting.

His business skills and expertise, across a range of sectors from energy to manufacturing and retail, will be invaluable in promoting the UK's excellence internationally.  Last year, Mr Wilson was named UK Global Director of the Year by the Institute of Directors for his work with Harris Tweed.

Brian Wilson said: ""Trade is politically neutral and translates directly into jobs and prosperity at home.  I am very willing to make whatever contribution I can to supporting Scottish and other UK companies overseas and by encouraging more of our businesses to become exporters"". 

The Secretary of State for Scotland, Michael Moore, commented: ""I am delighted to see Brian Wilson being appointed as a UK Business Ambassador. He has an enormous amount of knowledge of the Scottish economy and will be a huge asset I look forward to working together to help boost Scotland's export performance which is a vital part of driving forward the Scottish economy.

""Our visit to Diageo underlines how important the whisky industry is to the Scottish economy but, equally, why we need to  focus our efforts on encouraging more exports by Scottish firms. Brian's expertise will be invaluable in helping us achieve that goal.""

The Business Ambassador Network has already provided essential support to the UK's trade and investment activities, helping to raise UK plc's profile globally in response to the recent economic challenges.

Mr Wilson will take on a flexible role with  a particular interest in promoting Scottish businesses.

The role includes:  
-  Promoting the UK economy and the Scottish business environment;  
-  Helping to restore confidence in business and promoting Scotland and the UK as the international business partner of choice;  
-  Encouraging more  businesses (especially SMEs) to engage in international business activities;  
 -  Briefing UK Ministers and HM Ambassadors on key business priorities and interests as they might arise;  
-  Meeting overseas Ministers and inward missions; and  
 - Underlining the mutual business benefits, in terms of global reach and impact, that Scotland and the rest of the UK enjoy together as UK plc, and the importance of that united approach.

"With just a week to go until the start of the Paralympic Games, a giant set of Agitos, the symbol for the Paralympic Games, has today been launched on the mound in Edinburgh.

This is the second set of giant Paralympic Agitos to launch in the UK before the Paralympic Games begin on the 29th August.

The Agitos were revealed by a spectacular stunt involving members of the Royal Air Force abseiling down from a helicopter and handing Paralympic archer Alasdair Hamilton an arrow which he shot into a target by the Agitos.

The launch was attended by London 2012 Director of Paralympic Integration and nine time gold medallist Chris Holmes, Paralympic archer Alasdair Hamilton and members of the Royal Air Force.

As part of the Paralympic Torch Relay preparations, a group of young disabled and non-disabled Scouts from communities near to Ben Nevis this morning ascended the mountain and used a ferrocerium rod to create the sparks that lit the flame for Scotland. The Flame was then placed in a miner's lantern and transferred to Edinburgh where it will be the focus for a day of Paralympic celebrations on Sunday 26 August.

The 14m wide, 9m high Agitos will provide a stunning backdrop for the start of Edinburgh¿s Paralympic Torch Relay celebrations, when the Scottish Flame will be used to light a ceremonial cauldron. The Agitos weigh just under one tonne and are made entirely of aluminium with a powder coat finish, with the recognisable red, blue and green colours. In total, 650 hours were spent designing, engineering and fabricating the Agitos.

The launch of the Paralympic Agitos coincides with a series of spectacular London 2012 Festival and Cultural Olympiad events in Edinburgh as part of the most ambitious Edinburgh Festivals season ever presented. Highlights include hundreds of runners in specially designed light suits transforming Arthur's Seat for NVA's Speed of Light; major works by world-renowned directors in a unique dedicated theatre space at Lowland Hall at the Royal Highland Centre; Turner Prize-winning artist Susan Philipsz's Timeline multi-site sound installation; and a special Mela performance by New York drum 'n' brass band Red Baraat. Events are continuing across Scotland during the twelve-week UK-wide London 2012 Festival, which runs until the final day of the Paralympic Games on 9 September.

The Secretary of State for Scotland, Michael Moore said: ""It is fantastic to see the launch of the Paralympic Agitos on the Mound in Edinburgh. It is a great honour for the city to be able to put the symbol on prominent display which will serve to fuel excitement over the approaching Paralympic games. We are especially proud to be involving 26 Scottish Athletes as part of team GB n the London Paralympics.""

Seb Coe, LOCOG Chairman, said: ""I'm thrilled that as we get closer to the start of the Paralympic Games we are seeing the Paralympic symbol appearing in cities across the UK. This will no doubt continue to enthuse and inspire residents, athletes and spectators alike as they get ready to be part of the London 2012 Games.""

Alasdair Hamilton said: ""The Agitos launch here in Edinburgh marks the start of something quite special which will not happen again in our lifetime; the Paralympic Games on home ground. The Paralympic Games showcases the very best athletes from all corners of the world, they will not only challenge other competitors but the belief of many of what is possible in sport. It is an honour and a privilege to be a small part of this great event.""

"The Advocate General Lord Wallace will chair an all day forum of independent legal experts in Edinburgh today (Tuesday 21 Aug) to explore the legal and constitutional issues raised by the independence debate.

The forum of leading legal professors, senior practising lawyers and other legal experts will consider the strengths of the current constitutional arrangements which have been significantly modernised through devolution over the past 13 years, and will also explore the issues that would confront Scotland if it voted to separate from the rest of the United Kingdom.

Legal and constitutional matters affect almost every aspect of our day-to-day lives and it is important that people have a clear understanding of the choices an independent Scotland would face and who it would need to negotiate with to resolve these matters.

Independence for Scotland means Scotland would leave the UK and become an entirely new state. It would mean an end to the benefits of Scottish devolution within the UK.  Whoever formed the Government in a separate Scotland would also need to consider issues such as:

- the renegotiation of international treaties;

- whether to join the European Union and how to achieve that;

- what laws and regulations should be put in place to cover areas such as pensions and banking which are currently governed on a UK-wide basis;

- which currency should Scotland adopt and how would that be achieved. 

Irrespective of the decisions taken by any future independent Scottish Government on these matters, the final outcome would also depend on the outcome of political negotiations with the remainder of the UK, other states and institutions such as the European Union and NATO.

The legal forum's analysis will inform the programme of work announced by the Scottish Secretary in June to assess the benefits of Scotland remaining part of the  United  Kingdom. 

The intention is to provide the people of Scotland with facts and clarity to inform the debate before they vote in the independence referendum.

Lord Wallace of Tankerness QC said:

""The advantages to Scotland of our existing constitutional arrangements are often taken for granted. It will be very helpful for this forum of independent legal experts to examine the current situation and highlight the issues that Scotland would need to address if people were to vote for an independent Scotland.

""The people of Scotland need to know what the implications of independence would be for Scotland.  The legal and constitutional environment will shape many of the decisions that a separate Scotland would have to make.

""It is time for some assertions to be examined by independent experts and allow people to have a better understanding of the strengths of the UK and what differences independence would bring about.

""The current Scottish Government paint a picture of a separate Scotland that retains EU membership, retains sterling as our currency, retains UK banking regulations and gains a seat on the Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee. So far they have provided no credible explanation as to how they would achieve these ambitions, which at best depend on political negotiation with other states and international organisations.

""We need to have evidence and analysis at the heart of this debate. We are more than happy to have this subjected to scrutiny, and I would urge the Scottish Government to follow our lead by adopting an evidence-based approach and move away from mere assertion. The outcome of the independence referendum could take us on an irreversible path away from the rest of the UK.  People need an accurate assessment of what it would mean for Scotland.""

"The Scottish Secretary Michael Moore has invited the First Minister to meet with him to agree the detail of the referendum process.

Mr Moore wrote to Mr Salmond today saying that civil servants and Ministers from both Governments have made some useful progress but that an agreement can only reached by him and the First Minister. 

Ministers from the UK and Scottish Governments agreed yesterday on a timetable to have a Section 30 Order approved at the February Privy Council. This means that both governments should agree the detail of a draft Order in October to enable both the UK and Scottish Parliaments to approve it prior to the Privy Council meeting.   
    
A Section 30 Order requires the approval of both the UK and Scottish Parliaments and would provide the Scottish Parliament with the legal power to hold a referendum on independence.

Michael Moore said:

""It is helpful that we now have an agreement that a Section 30 Order should be approved by the February Privy Council. This will enable the Scottish Government to fulfil their commitment to introduce referendum legislation in early 2013. We are absolutely committed to helping the Scottish Government deliver on their promise to hold a referendum on independence.

""We are eight months on from the two government consultations being launched and the Scottish Government have still to produce their responses. The issues that need to be agreed are no secret and they have not changed since January.

""Civil servants and Ministers from both Governments have cleared some of the path towards reaching an agreement on a legal, fair and decisive referendum At the end of the day however, it is going to be the First Minister and I who will have to reach an agreement.

""I see no reason why we cannot sort this out in the next couple of months. The First Minister promised a referendum on independence. I promise that we will help him deliver a referendum on independence.""

Before the Privy Council can consider the Section 30 Order it must be approved by both the UK and Scottish Parliaments.

Scotland Office Minister David Mundell met with Scottish Government Minister Bruce Crawford in Edinburgh today and assured him that the UK Government is committed to working hard towards an agreement on the basis of the indicative timetable discussed at the meeting and expressed his view that agreement between the two governments by October is realistic and achievable.

Following the meeting at the Scottish Parliament, David Mundell said:

""This is a positive step forward. We kicked off this process back in January. The issues have not changed in the past eight months and we really need to use the next two months to ensure we deliver a referendum that is legal, fair and decisive. 

""I am very confident that an agreement can be struck. We all agree that a Section 30 Order is the best way to deliver a legal referendum. All the main political parties agree that a single question on independence is what they prefer. 

""We want to make it legal for the Scottish Parliament to hold an independence referendum. That is our objective. From this starting point, and the goodwill we are bringing to the process, agreement between the two governments by October is realistic and achievable.

"The Secretary of State for Scotland has welcomed the news that Shaun Kingsbury has been appointed as the Chief Executive of the UK Green Investment Bank (UK GIB), which is headquartered in Edinburgh.

Mr Kingsbury, is currently an investment partner at Hudson Clean Energy Partners. The UK Government also announced the appointment of the Bank's Non-Executive Directors, including a number of senior Scots with significant expertise in finance and green energy.

Michael Moore said: ""The UK GIB has a key role to play in promoting investment in our environment and technologies across the UK. Getting the right expertise on the private sector and key energy projects is essential and the appointment of Shaun Kingsbury is an important and positive step forward.  I know Lord Smith and Sir Adrian Montague have been working hard behind the scenes as the UK GIB moves towards  being fully operational and this appointment adds to the considerable expertise already in place.

""I am also glad to see the number of hugely experienced and influential Scots announced as Non-Executive Directors. This fully reflects the fact this is a UK institution headquartered in Edinburgh and supported by a strong team in London.""

The list of Non-Executive Directors includes three Scots. The six announced today are:

-       Professor Dame Julia King;

-       Fred Maroudas;

-       Tom Murley;

-       David Nish;

-       Professor Isobel Sharp CBE; and

-       Tessa Tennant.

The UK GIB is designed to accelerate private sector investment in the UK's transition to a green economy. Offshore wind power generation, commercial and industrial waste processing and recycling, energy from waste generation, non-domestic energy efficiency and support for the Green Deal will be the first priority sectors for the UK GIB, subject to approval by the European Commission.

The Government is committed to setting the UK firmly on course towards a green and growing economy. The transition to a green economy presents significant growth opportunities for UK-based businesses, both at home and abroad. This progression requires unprecedented investment in key green sectors. An estimated investment of up to £200 billion in the energy system alone is needed over the period to 2020. The UK GIB will be uniquely placed to facilitate the transition to a green economy base by addressing the market failures affecting green infrastructure projects.  These failures have led to significant under investment in the key areas required to deliver this transition. Capitalised with £3 billion, the GIB will complement other green policies to help accelerate additional capital in green infrastructure.

During the discussions, Mr Moore emphasised the importance of maximising flexibility in the final CAP package so that EU Member States are able to implement programmes that are appropriate to their particular national circumstances.  The landscape and farm types in Scotland, for example, are generally very different to elsewhere in the UK and so the UK Government is pushing for the flexibility to vary the means in which the CAP is implemented according to local conditions.  Mr Moore also raised concerns about the speed of transition from historic to area based payments. 

Mr Moore said:  ""The UK Government is using its experience and considerable clout within the EU to help shape a CAP that delivers for Scottish farmers, the taxpayer, and the environment.  We want to encourage a resilient and sustainable industry where our frmers are able compete effectively at a global level.

"Olympians and Paralympians from Scotland have had the chance to shine on the world stage this summer as part of Team GB, the Secretary of State for Scotland said today.

Commenting as he joined the celebrations in London to mark the success of Team GB and Paralympics GB, the Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore said:

""This summer has been a huge success for the UK. We have put on an Olympics and Paralympics which have set the standard for future events and the support here and around the globe has been incredible.

""The scenes on the streets of London today were an absolutely incredible finale to an amazing summer of sport.

""All of Britain got behind our wonderful athletes and today they turned out in force to show their thanks.

""London was a brilliant host but all of Britain played their part. From all parts of the UK we came out to cheer the Olympic and Paralympic torches. From all parts of the UK, people made their way to the Games to volunteer or support the athletes. In all parts of Britain we cheered on our athletes from our living rooms and pubs.

""It was truly amazing and today's celebration was a chance another great memory to take away from this wonderful summer of sport.""

SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND, CITY UK EVENT

""We're here today to discuss the contribution that the Scottish financial services sector makes not just to the Scottish economy but also to the wider UK economy;

To think about how we make sure that Government - whether that be in Holyrood, Westminster or Brussels - is supporting this vital industry;

And to consider how the industry and Government, working together, can best ensure that the sector continues to seize the opportunities and respond to the challenges we face.

I want, this morning, to set the scene with the steps that the UK Government is taking in London and Brussels;

The steps we are taking to promote a stable and internationally competitive financial services sector through our regulatory reforms;

And our wider economic reforms.

You will not be surprised to learn that I will also argue that Scotland's place in a strong and stable UK provides the industry with the certainty it needs in a competitive, global environment.

The financial services sector has of course experienced some tough times in recent years.

Governments, industry - we must all share responsibility for this. We must be candid about what went wrong, but more than that, we must work together to find the right way forward.

One thing that remains true, past, present and future, is that this sector is of vital importance to all of us.

Your sector provides direct employment for more than 95,000 people in Scotland.

A quarter of UK life insurance and pensions employment is based in Scotland, and 13% of UK banking sector employment.

Scotland plays host to renowned homegrown companies such as Standard Life, Aberdeen Asset Management, Baillie Gifford, Alliance Trust and Scottish Widows.

And its strengths have persuaded many others from outside Scotland to base themselves here - including companies such as State Street, Citibank, BNY Mellon, Morgan Stanley, Barclays and Virgin Money, to name but a few.

The sector provides the banking and investment services that households and businesses rely on in everyday life;

It provides life and general insurance service to protect us when things go wrong;

And it provides pensions and long-term savings to support us in the future.

These services are important to millions of people and thousands of businesses;

And that is reflected in the significant contribution the sector makes, with the industry accounting for around £8.5 billion, or 7% of Scottish GDP.

I understand the importance of this industry. And I want to make clear to you today that the UK Government understands it too.

Of course, the UK Government had to take rapid, and historically unprecedented, action to support the financial sector during the crisis. And of course we have all had to learn hard lessons as a result. But the UK Government is now looking forward.

We are not shying away from fixing the problems, but we are also implementing policies that will enable the Scottish financial sector to support jobs, provide vital services and contribute to the Scottish economy over the long term.

We aim to strike the right regulatory balance to deliver an acceptable level of risk to Government, shareholders and consumers.

We are determined to make the UK the best place in Europe to start, finance and grow a business;

A crucial part of this is to ensure that we have a robust and stable financial system.

Our programme of regulatory reform aims to ensure that Scotland has a reformed, fair and competitive financial services industry.

The new system of regulation that we are putting in place will give the Bank of England - and as announced by the Chancellor earlier this week, its new Governor, Mark Carney - responsibility for overseeing the financial system.

We are creating the Financial Conduct Authority to supervise all firms to ensure that business across financial services and markets is conducted in a way that advances the interests of all involved.

Within the EU and other international forums, we are working closely with our key partners to ensure that the legislative framework fully supports the unity and integrity of the single market, and creates the right environment for stable and sustainable growth in financial services and the wider economy.

This is a hugely important point - the industry should be in no doubt as to the benefits that accrue as a result of the UK¿s influence and voice on the international stage.

Being part of the UK allows Scotland's voice to be heard on such key issues as Solvency II, where we are urging EU institutions to act decisively and agree a credible process for resolving disagreement on the treatment of long-term products, and commit to a realistic timetable for Solvency II implementation.

We are strongly opposing the imposition of Solvency II-inspired capital requirements on the pensions industry. These would negatively affect millions of Europeans, by reducing growth, investment, competitiveness, jobs and pensions income.

We are a vocal opponent of attempts to ¿water down¿ international agreements on issues like tough bank capital requirements, in order to avoid regulatory arbitrage and financial instability.

And we have pushed back hard against unworkable proposals for a Financial Transaction Tax.

Of course, we are not only acting in the area of regulation.

Elsewhere, we are taking decisive action to ensure that the Scottish financial and professional services sector can flourish. That action includes:

Working with the banking industry to improve competition.

We are removing barriers to entry and growth for mutuals and credit unions, to help foster diversity in financial services;

And we are working to introduce a more competitive tax regime for funds, including special taxation rules to facilitate tax transparent funds, allowing UK-based asset management companies to thrive.

In the area of professional services, some of you may have attended an event last week at which the Advocate General set out the work the UK Government is doing in support of the Scottish legal services sector.

The UK Government is ensuring that the Scottish legal sector has promotional opportunities through the unique UK Government network around the world. We recognise that the sector is of huge importance, underpinning strong economic growth in all sectors, including financial services.

Of even greater importance to the financial and professional services sector, we are working to help return the wider Scottish economy to growth - we understand that, just as the financial services sector is vital to the health of the wider economy, so the health of the wider economy is fundamental to the prospects of the sector.

So we are reforming the tax system to help promote growth.

We will introduce a reduction in the main rate of corporation tax to 22% in 2014, the lowest in the G7.

We are taking action to support bank lending to businesses, including through initiatives such as the Funding for Lending Scheme.

We have introduced the Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme to encourage investment in new start-ups and in businesses with the highest growth potential.

The UK Guarantees Scheme will help dramatically to accelerate investment in infrastructure.

And we are reducing regulation and making procurement processes simpler to help small businesses gain access to Government contracts.

Let me now turn to the final issue I will speak about today - Scotland's place in the UK, and the benefits our United Kingdom brings to the financial and professional services sector.

I mentioned at the outset the historic strength and enduring place of the financial services sector here in Scotland.

But I know from meeting and talking with many of you that those working in this industry would be the first to acknowledge the benefits that we derive from close ties with the rest of the UK and the City of London in particular.

Under the current arrangements, the Scottish financial services sector benefits hugely from the strong and credible Bank of England as its central bank, lender of last resort, and - as demonstrated with HM Treasury in recent times of crisis - the rapid and coordinated action between strong, credible fiscal and monetary authorities.

Coordinating the Bank's monetary activism with the greater fiscal firepower that the UK, as a larger and diversified economy, is able to leverage, has been absolutely crucial to our financial system.

The UK Government spent £45 billion recapitalising RBS. In addition, the bank received £275 billion of state support in the form of guarantees and funding. In total, this would have been more than 200% of Scotland's GDP on any measure - including the Scottish Government's preferred one that includes a geographical share of North Sea oil.

The UK Government was able to deliver a coordinated response that mitigated the significant harm that could have been caused to the UK economy and our families and businesses if the two banks had collapsed.

It¿s unclear to me how an independent Scotland, which the First Minister wanted to be more light-touch in its regulation of the sector, could have achieved that.

Let's also look at the benefits of a highly integrated UK financial services marketplace. Taking two examples; the mortgage and life insurance sectors, in the last financial year:

Fewer than a fifth of mortgages provided by Scottish firms were for Scottish properties, with the remainder - four fifths - for properties in the rest of the UK.

Eight out of ten life insurance products sold to Scottish postcodes were from rest of the UK firms; and

Only one in ten life insurance products sold by Scottish firms were to Scottish postcodes - nine out of every ten sold went to the rest of the UK.

One of the main factors underpinning this integration is that we have a single regulatory environment covering the whole of the UK.

Why would anyone wish to put a barrier in the middle of these transactions? Doing so could surely only harm competition and choice, and drive up costs for Scottish consumers.

The plans and consequences of leaving the UK are based on shifting sands and enormous doubt.

Gone are the days where we heard about the differences that independence will bring - now apparently everything will definitely remain the same.

It's not just the pound sterling that the Scottish Government claim they now want to adopt, but also the UK's financial regulatory framework.

The Scottish Government like to tell us that banks and financial services in an independent Scotland would remain under the UK regulatory regime because ""that framework is solid and substantial"" - John's own words.

But as you in this audience know, under European rules every member state must have its own regulatory system.

The Scottish Government tell us that they will be part of Europe, but they have yet to explain how their proposal to adopt the financial framework of another state would work. (Never mind how they will become part of the EU!)

Now there are those who say that Scots need not worry about these problems because the Referendum Agreement states that Scotland's two governments will work together.

That Paragraph 30 is a magic paragraph that will erase all the difficult questions.

Well, let's be crystal clear this morning about what this agreement does - and does not - mean.

And let¿s begin by hearing the Paragraph 30 text itself.

""The United Kingdom and Scottish Governments are committed, through the Memorandum of Understanding between them and others, to working together on matters of mutual interest and to the principles of good communication and mutual respect.

The two governments have reached this agreement in that spirit.

They look forward to a referendum that is legal and fair producing a decisive and respected outcome.

The two governments are committed to continue to work together constructively in the light of the outcome, whatever it is, in the best interests of the people of Scotland and of the rest of the United Kingdom.""

This means that the two governments will conduct the referendum on the same constructive terms as they work today.

It means that if the referendum follows the path set out in the Order and Agreement, its outcome will be decisive.

And it means that, regardless of what the result is, that constructive relationship should continue as we move forward.

That is good practice and common sense.

But what it does not mean is that, in the event of a yes vote, the remaining UK would facilitate Scotland¿s every wish - any more than an independent Scotland would unquestioningly facilitate the wishes of the remaining UK.

Inevitably, when there are two separate countries, there are two sets of interests - sometimes mutual, sometimes at odds.

So it is in the UK's relationships with its closest allies today.

And so it will always be between separate, sovereign states.

Nor does it mean that the difficult questions that would face a newly independent Scotland would all be within the UK's gift to resolve.

Membership of the EU, participation in NATO, international regulation of our financial services.

These deeply complex issues would require resolution on the international stage, and Scotland alone would take responsibility for tackling them.

This too is common sense.

So the Edinburgh Agreement - particularly its Paragraph 30 - are a statement of our determination to hold a referendum that is legal, fair and decisive.

They do not - cannot - pre-empt the implications of that vote.

I know that this is what the words mean.

Because I negotiated them.

This all matters because the key to a strong financial services sector is confidence and stability.

And not just to this sector but to the whole economy.

So we need more than optimistic assertions of what might be, without evidence, analysis, or support.

That approach will not help the Scottish financial services in a global industry where confidence and stability are hugely important.

That is why the UK Government is setting out what we are doing now to support the financial services in Scotland; and we will continue to do so over the next few months.

 It's also why the Scottish Government must set out what the details of its independence proposal would be for this sector

And why each and everyone of you should examine statements from both Governments and test them, in just the same way that you would examine and test your own business models.

Where we do not have all the answers - we must be honest and say that. Where the Scottish Government cannot give the financial services industry or the Scottish people a guarantee - for example where matters need to be negotiated, and agreed with others - the Scottish Government must be clear of the limits of what they can promise.

It is only by doing so, by us all being candid, that we ensure the facts are heard, and that everyone is able to make an informed choice in the referendum.

To get the right outcome for the financial services sector

And the right outcome for Scotland.""

"The spotlight fell on the work done by the UK Government and its partners to combat human trafficking today as the Scotland Office David Mundell marked Anti-Slavery Day with a visit to Edinburgh Airport.

The Minister met UK Border Force staff to discuss the way it works with its partners, including Lothian & Borders Police, to put measures in place to prevent trafficking and the arrangements which are in place to identify and support victims.

He was one of a number of UK Government Ministers on visits across the country to highlight Anti-Slavery Day. The Advocate General for Scotland, the Lord Wallace of Tankerness QC, will represent the UK Government at a summit on human trafficking in Edinburgh, hosted by the Scottish Government's Justice Secretary.

A report published today by the Inter-Departmental Ministerial Group (IDMG) on Human Trafficking shows that more work than ever before is being carried out both in the UK and internationally to prosecute criminals and stop trafficking gangs in their tracks. It explains gangs that lure victims to the UK and then exploit them for sex, labour and domestic slavery are being targeted following action by the UK Government.

You can read it here: [http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/crime/human-trafficking/](http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/crime/human-trafficking/)

Scotland Office Minister David Mundell said:

""The UK Government is taking major steps to clamp down on the terrible crime of human trafficking across the country. It is an issue with a high human cost and we must work across the board to protect those at risk and bring the criminals responsible to justice.

""We have already taken significant steps in the fight against trafficking but the UK Government knows more can be done. We'll continue to work across government and with others to make sure we keep ahead of the threat  and do all we can to keep vulnerable people safe.""

Organised criminal gangs within countries including China, Nigeria, Vietnam, Slovakia and Romania now pose the greatest threat to the UK but co-ordinated action between the UK and these countries including intelligence sharing with international police forces, lobbying governments to ratify the UN convention against transnational organised crime and raising awareness about trafficking through local media in source countries is proving effective.

The UK Government is also working with these countries to tackle the problem at its source by lobbying for changes to countries¿ laws. UK prosecutors from the Crown Prosecution Service's International Team are based in priority countries to improve their criminal justice response to traffickers, training judges, prosecutors and investigators to deal with offences better and to gather evidence and support for prosecutions in the UK.

The IDMG Report shows that during the past two years, thousands of front-line professionals including border staff, police and healthcare staff have been trained to better identify, support and protect those vulnerable individuals who may be suffering abuse at the hands of traffickers. Victim profiles have been developed and given to border staff and a human trafficking intelligence and victim referral map and guidance has been issued to all border staff.

Some airlines including Virgin Atlantic and Thomas Cook are training cabin crew to identify those who may be engaged in trafficking and their potential victims and a 24-hour confidential line has been set up for crew to report concerns to Border Force before a plane lands in the UK. The government is currently working with other UK based airlines to encourage them to sign-up. There is also ongoing work with other key industries including hotels and hospitality to raise awareness of trafficking.

"The Foreign Affairs Select Committee today published evidence submitted by the UK Government to its inquiry into the foreign policy implications of and for a separate Scotland. Commenting on the publication, the Foreign Secretary said:

""As part of the UK, Scotland benefits from a place at the top table exercising influence in international organisations, including the EU, NATO and the G8. We have one of the most extensive, well-respected diplomatic and consular networks in the world, supporting thousands of UK citizens overseas and providing the essential infrastructure to support our foreign policy objectives. This network, along with targeted assistance from UK Trade and Investment, delivers world-class support to UK businesses.

""Our global presence means we are in a strong position as a country to protect our citizens at home and overseas, to help our businesses in an increasingly competitive world, and to offer the strongest possible basis to promote our foreign policy objectives.

""The UK is one of the most successful and long-standing political, social and economic unions in history. The close ties and our shared history mean we can project significant influence in the world and face global challenges and risks by pooling our talents and resources. The UK Government's position is clear: Scotland benefits from being part of the UK and the UK benefits from having Scotland within the UK"".

The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore said:

""Now that we have resolved the questions surrounding the process, the UK Government is eager to get into the real substance of this debate. Since agreement was reached on the process on Monday, the UK Government has released information on the benefits of the UK for the economy, defence and now foreign affairs.

""The economy, foreign policy and defence are some of the most fundamental responsibilities of any sovereign state, so it is fitting that the real debate should begin with discussion of these issues. Within the United Kingdom, Scotland¿s voice around the world is stronger and more influential, and this delivers real benefits to Scottish people and businesses at home and overseas.

""The UK Government has always said that it would provide evidence and analysis to inform the decision facing the people of Scotland which we will publish during the course of 2013, drawing on a wide range of viewpoints. The Advocate General¿s Legal Forum will be meeting again to consider the legal issues in more depth. We want to engage seriously with the arguments and set out the facts of what independence would mean. The Scottish Government must do the same.""

The evidence outlined the scope of the UK's global network worldwide:

""The FCO's global diplomatic network of around 270 posts [in 170 countries, employing 14,000 staff is the essential infrastructure for our foreign policy and our influence overseas. This enables the UK to deliver a distinctive foreign policy that extends its global reach and influence on bilateral and multilateral issues such as climate change, human rights and global security, as well as assisting UK nationals overseas.""

 ""Consular assistance overseas remains a very high priority - during 2010/11, there were over 55 million trips overseas by British nationals and over 43,400 British nationals needed some form of consular assistance. During the various national disasters and political unrest in early 2011, the FCO helped over 6,300 people with assisted departures or evacuations.""

 The evidence also highlighted the UK's efforts to support businesses overseas:

""UKTI [UK Trade & Investment] assists thousands of businesses to exploit trade opportunities annually, helping them to deliver billions of pounds of additional profit, and supporting hundreds of high value inward investments projects.""

 ""As part of the UK, SDI [Scottish Development International]'s own offices in 13 countries are complemented by the extensive UKTI network of 162 offices in 96 countries, and can draw on the UK's diplomatic representation in the rest of the world. Independence would mean that Scottish companies and potential foreign investors in Scotland would lose access to that global network, and risk missing out on investment in the form of jobs, skills, capital and tax revenue from all over the world.""

The evidence stated the UK Government's views on the issue of **EU membership**:

""To date, the Scottish Government has made a number of claims about the status of an independent Scotland, including its membership of international bodies. Notably it has asserted that Scotland would continue to be a member of the EU in the event of independence, and would not have to negotiate the terms of its membership as a new Member State. It is not clear on what basis this assertion is made and no evidence has yet been supplied to support this claim.""

""It is, however, evident that this issue is not straightforward, and that the Scottish Government cannot take for granted the idea that Scotland would secede from the UK but automatically stay in the EU. Decisions about EU membership need the unanimous agreement of all Member States.""

""The UK Government is carrying out further detailed analysis on the benefits of the UK's international position and its membership of the EU and other international institutions, and these important issues of international law, including with the assistance of external experts. These findings will be published in due course.""

The evidence went on to outline the significance of the questions surrounding EU membership:

""The question of an independent Scotland's membership of the EU is of fundamental importance because this would involve detailed negotiation with the remainder of the UK and other existing Member States on the terms of Scotland's membership, including complex areas such as fisheries quotas and Scotland's financial contributions. Such negotiations would have far-reaching implications for Scotland and the rest of the UK as they would also need to address Scotland's position in relation to the European single currency and the Schengen free movement area, which every new Member State since 2004 has committed to joining when they meet the criteria.""

"Plans by the UK Government to set up the world's first Green Investment Bank (UK GIB) have been approved by the European Commission today. The Bank is now set to begin operations in the next few weeks.

State aid approval gives UK GIB the remit to make investments on commercial terms across a wide range of green economy sectors.

Scottish Secretary Michael Moore welcomed the decision of the European Commission to grant approval to the UK Green Investment Bank under EU State Aid rules.

Mr Moore said: ""I am delighted that the UK Government has, after detailed discussions with the Commission, successfully made the case for the UK Green Investment Bank to start making investments in the green economy.

""This is another vital step towards the establishment of the Bank's headquarters in Edinburgh and its office in London. Funded with £3bn of UK Government money, the UK GIB is an outstanding example of the many ways in which Scotland and the rest of the UK are stronger together, harnessing our combined strengths to make a real difference to the development of a low carbon economy across the UK.

""I look forward to the Bank getting up and running in the coming months, promoting the development of a green finance cluster in Scotland that will play a significant role in rebalancing the UK economy.""

 Business Secretary Vince Cable said:

""This marks an important step. Funded with £3 billion of Government money and mobilising additional private capital, the UK Green Investment Bank has the potential to make a significant contribution to the development of a green economy. State aid approval gives the Bank the green light to expand investment in the UK's green infrastructure.""

Earlier this year the Bank was established as a public company, UK Green Investment Bank plc. Following approval from the European Commission, final preparations are now in hand for the UK GIB to begin making investments.

Shaun Kingsbury, the Bank's Chief Executive Officer, and six new non-executive directors will take up their positions on the Board on 29 October. The official launch of UK GIB will be at the end of November.

UK Green Investment Bank Chair Lord Smith said:

""This is excellent news and a very important milestone as we transition to a low carbon economy and work to boost investment across the industry. We have already made significant progress in building our teams and the necessary infrastructure for the Bank and we expect to be fully operational in the next few weeks. We clearly have challenges ahead but we have the people, the expertise and the capability to deliver on our priorities and create the foundation for a new climate of green investment.""

In the period before state aid approval for UK GIB, investments have been made on commercial terms by BIS¿s UK Green Investments team (UKGI). To date, UKGI has committed £180 million to specialist fund managers to co-invest equity in smaller waste infrastructure, energy from waste, and non domestic energy efficiency projects. Assets built up by UKGI will transfer to the Bank.

State aid approval by the European Commission sets out the structure and operating principles of the UK GIB and that it can make investments on commercial terms in the following sectors:

Priority sectors:

Offshore wind  
Waste (treatment and recycling and energy from waste)  
Non domestic energy efficiency

Other sectors:

Biofuels for transport  
Biomass power  
Carbon capture and storage  
Marine energy  
Renewable heat

"The House of Commons Defence Committee last night published evidence submitted by the UK Government to its inquiry into the defence implications of possible Scottish independence.

Commenting on the publication, the Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said: 

""As part of the UK, Scotland benefits from high levels of protection and security provided by the UK's sophisticated defence capabilities, including highly capable, well equipped and well supported armed forces. The UK also has a strong network of alliances and relationships, which, together with our defence capabilities, ensure national security and resilience, protecting our people, economy, infrastructure, territory and way of life. They help to shape a stable world through actions beyond our borders to reduce the likelihood of risks affecting the UK or our direct interests overseas.

""Scotland, as an integral part of the UK, plays a big role in the defence of the UK. It is home to major Navy, Army and RAF bases and other key facilities. Scots and Scottish-recruited units are an integral part of the UK armed forces. And the defence industry in Scotland, including its shipbuilding industry, plays a key role in equipping and supporting the UK armed forces. 

""The United Kingdom is one of the most successful and long-standing political, social and economic unions in history. The close ties and our shared history mean we can project significant influence in the world and face global challenges and risks with our shared talents and resources. The UK Government's position is clear: Scotland benefits from being part of the UK and the UK benefits from having Scotland within the UK"".

The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore said:

""As an integral part of the UK, Scotland plays a big role in the defence of the UK and benefits from high levels of protection and security, significant international influence and great opportunities for industry. We are stronger and safer as part of the UK family. 

""Our armed forces are totally integrated across the UK. It is absurd to suggest that an independent Scotland would simply produce a mini version of the UK armed forces.""

The evidence outlines Scotland¿s key role in the defence of the UK . Extracts from the evidence include:

""Scotland, as an integral part of the UK, plays a key role in the defence of the UK. It is currently the location of major bases for: the strategic nuclear deterrent; four regular infantry battalions and an air support regiment; two Royal Marines Commando units; and five squadrons of fast jets, including those providing the UK's northern quick reaction alert force. There are also a significant number of reserve units, extensive training and testing areas and other facilities there. As at 1 July 2012, there were some 15,500 Ministry of Defence personnel located in Scotland, including some 11,000 regular armed forces and 4,500 civilian personnel, at some 50 locations across the country. Future plans envisage bases in Scotland for: all Royal Navy submarines; an Army brigade; and one of the Royal Air Force's three fast jet main operating bases.""

""Scots and Scottish-recruited units are an integral part of the UK armed forces and are highly integrated into the overall force structure of the UK's very sophisticated fighting forces. In 2011/12, about 9% of recruits to the regular armed forces were recruited through Scottish recruiting offices. There are around 3,000 volunteer reserves and 17,000 cadets in Scotland. Scots have a proud and distinguished record of service in the armed forces.""

""There is a substantial defence industrial footprint in Scotland, ranging from design, manufacture, assembly and maintenance of complex warships on the Clyde and at Rosyth to the latest high-tech innovations in aerospace engineering, defence electronics and electro-optical systems in companies based right throughout Scotland. As part of the UK defence industry, the defence industry in Scotland has a highly skilled workforce and plays a key role in equipping and supporting the UK armed forces.""

The evidence also explains the defence benefits for Scotland of being part of the UK:

""The UK has the fourth largest defence budget in the world. Agreed funding for defence over the period 2011/12 to 2014/15 is some £34 billion per year, which meets the NATO target to devote at least 2% of Gross Domestic Product to defence.""

""It is important to emphasise that all parts of the UK gain significant benefits from the provision of defence on a UK basis. The formulation of defence policy and strategy and the planning and delivery of defence on a UK basis provides high levels of protection and security for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, as well as the Overseas Territories, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man and British citizens abroad. As an integral part of the UK, Scotland receives the full benefits of this protection and security.""

The evidence states the UK Government's views on the possible implications for Scotland if it decided to separate from the UK:

""There is no doubt that a smaller nation of just over 5 million people would have a much smaller defence presence than that of the UK with over 60 million. There would be a much smaller tax base and a much smaller recruiting base. That would inevitably have implications for defence manpower and budget and the armed forces' capabilities, including being able to protect its own territory and to deploy on exercises and operations, especially those connected with any international commitments.2

""The creation of independent Scottish armed forces would not be as simple as transferring existing Scottish-recruited or Scotland-based units as this would not create in any sense a coherent, credible or balanced force.""

""In terms of defence industry in Scotland, should it decide to separate from the UK, we are sure that companies there would continue to make strong bids for UK defence contracts; but they would then be competing for business in an international market. And it would only be eligible to bid for contracts that are competed outside the UK..""

The evidence went on to address the issue of NATO membership:

""The UK Government believes that Scotland is certainly stronger in defence terms as part of the UK within NATO and does not believe it would be in the interests of an independent Scotland not to be a member of NATO. However, if an independent Scotland decided that it wanted to be a member of NATO, the North Atlantic Council would need to decide whether or not it would meet the criteria for membership. There is no guarantee that NATO membership would be automatic.""

The HCDC announced that it was to embark on an inquiry into the defence implications of possible Scottish independence on 10 May; it announced the terms of reference for the inquiry on 29 June. The MOD memorandum was submitted in response to the Committee's invitations for written evidence. This will be followed by Ministerial oral evidence at a date to be arranged.

These are difficult economic times in the face of a world economy facing a number of challenges.

""It is important we maintain the UK¿s position as a relative safe haven from those global issues and continue to provide firms with the certainty and support they need to build confidence and create sustainable, long-term jobs.

""This Government is consistent and clear that there can be no complacency in getting people back into jobs as we take decisive steps to deal with the UK¿s debt and deficit. The action we have taken so far has helped to make the whole of the UK, including Scotland, one of the most competitive economies.

""There are some positive signs, such as the third consecutive monthly fall in the number of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance. We will continue to do as much as we can to help people find work through targeted support available at Scotland's JobCentre Plus network.""

"The Secretary of State for Scotland and the Prime Minister David Cameron have signed an agreement with Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond which will give the Scottish Parliament the power to hold a referendum on independence.

Michael Moore said:

""The next two years provide us with a unique opportunity to highlight the benefits of the UK and to seek the positive endorsement of people in Scotland.

""I want the next two years to be about more than fending off the threat of independence. I want an informed national debate in which the full and positive case for Scotland staying within the UK family is made, heard and won. The onus is on us to provide the strong and positive case for the United Kingdom. We will do that. The ultimate responsibility will then rest with the people of Scotland.

""The advantages of being part of the UK are quietly accepted by most Scots. Often those advantages are left unearthed or go unreported just because they are the status quo. This campaign will be an opportunity to change that. We can put up in lights the benefits to Scotland of being part of our United Kingdom.

""The issues at the heart of this debate include the scale of our economy, the strength of our defence, and our strong voice in the world, speaking out for Scottish interests. As we move forwards, producing evidence and making the case, I am confident that people across Scotland will stand up in support of the UK over these things too.""

The Prime Minister David Cameron said:

""This marks the beginning of an important chapter in Scotland's story and allows the real debate to begin.

""It paves the way so that the biggest question of all can be settled: a separate Scotland or a United Kingdom? I will be making a very positive argument for our United Kingdom.

"Scotland Office Minister David Mundell has welcomed the Commonwealth Games Act 2008 (Ticket Touting Offence) Order 2012.

The Order which was signed on 16 July 2012 comes into force today and makes it an offence under the laws of England, Wales and Northern Ireland to tout a Glasgow Commonwealth Games 2014 ticket.

Prior to this order coming into force, the 2008 Act of the Scottish Parliament made it an offence in Scots law to tout a Commonwealth Games ticket but this offence was not enforceable under the law of England and Wales and Northern Ireland. Therefore additional measures were needed to prevent the touting of Commonwealth Games tickets across the rest of the United Kingdom. 

Mr Mundell said:

""The Olympic year has been a fantastic success which people from all parts of the UK and beyond have enjoyed.  Now it is vital that we take all necessary steps to ensure that Scotland benefits from the legacy of the 2012 Olympics.""illegal for anyone to attempt to exploit this fantastic sporting event and profit at the expense of genuine fans.  We are also continuing to work to ensure that home fans and particularly overseas guests who may not be aware of normal trading practices here in the UK, are not unfairly targeted by sales of blackmarket tickets""

"Business Secretary Vince Cable has declared the UK Green Investment Bank plc (UK GIB) officially open for business and announced two new investments.

The ground breaking institution has been funded with £3 billion of Government money and will mobilise additional private capital to make a significant contribution to the development of a green economy.

Speaking in Edinburgh where the new bank is headquartered, Dr Cable revealed that UK GIB had made its first investment since becoming operational, committing an initial £8 million to a project in the North East of England that will generate energy from waste. This will attract a further £8 million of matching private sector funding.

The construction of an Anaerobic Digestion (AD) plant at Teesside is the first of six planned over the next five years, making it the largest single AD project in the UK.  The investment, made through fund manager Greensphere Capital, is part of a £80 million investment programme by UK GIB in small waste projects.

Vince Cable said:

""The Green Investment Bank - a key coalition pledge - is now a reality. It will place the green economy at the heart of our recovery and position the UK in the forefront of the drive to develop clean energy.

""Three billion pounds of government money will leverage private sector capital to fund projects in priority sectors from offshore wind to waste and non domestic energy efficiency, helping to deliver our commitment to create jobs and growth right across the UK.  Having the headquarters in Edinburgh is a powerful vote of confidence in the Union, and a testimony to our commitment to helping Scotland lead the green revolution.""

The Business Secretary also announced that UK GIB will invest £5 million to retrofit Kingspan's UK industrial facilities with systems and services that will reduce its energy consumption by as much as 15 per cent.  This investment, through Sustainable Development Capital, is UK GIB's first project supported in its £100 million non-domestic energy efficiency investment programme. 

Dr Cable made the investment announcements with the Bank's Chair Lord Smith of Kelvin and Chief Executive Shaun Kingsbury at a stakeholder event in Edinburgh to officially launch UK GIB. They were joined by Energy Secretary Edward Davey, Scotland Secretary Michael Moore and Energy Minister Greg Barker.

The Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change Edward Davey said:

""The Green Investment Bank will help attract the capital required to allow the green economy to blossom, encouraging investors to market and kick-starting low-carbon and energy efficiency projects.  In combination with our electricity market reforms, there will be lasting economic benefit as a result, with new expertise and jobs created, that will give the UK a competitive edge.""

The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore said:

""The UK Green Investment Bank is now ready to have a real and positive impact on investment in our green and renewables sectors that will take them into new areas and opportunities. We have the best of both worlds: a headquarters in Edinburgh, at the centre of Scotland''s thriving businesses and asset management, coupled with a team based in London, the world's leading financial centre.

""The next step is to put that expertise into action and mobilise the additional investment we need to take the UK towards a greener economy. This is the first bank of its kind in the world and this government has delivered it for Scotland and the rest of the UK.¿

UK Green Investment Bank Chair Lord Smith said:

""The Green Investment Bank has the potential to be a game-changing component of the UK's low carbon economy, and a profitable centre of excellence in specialist and renewable investment.

""Over the coming months and years, I am confident that our excellent team will put its many years of expertise to work on building the foundations of that sustainable economy, and facilitating the important investments that will ensure its long-term good health.""

Earlier this year the Bank was established as a public company, UK Green Investment Bank plc. Following state aid approval from the European Commission last month it is now operational as an independent bank and open for business.

In the period before state aid approval for UK GIB, investments have been made on commercial terms by BIS¿s UK Green Investments team (UKGI). To date, UKGI has committed £180 million to specialist fund managers to co-invest equity in smaller waste infrastructure, energy from waste, and non domestic energy efficiency projects.  Assets built up by UKGI have transferred to the UK GIB.

In May 2012, UK Green Investment Bank plc was formed as a public company. Lord Smith of Kelvin was appointed as Chair and Sir Adrian Montague as Deputy Chair and Senior Independent Director.

In September 2012 Shaun Kingsbury was appointed as Chief Executive along with six non-executive directors - Professor Dame Julia King, Fred Maroudas, Tom Murley, David Nish, Professor Isobel Sharp CBE and Tessa Tennant.

In October 2012 UK GIB was granted state aid approval by the European Commission and became fully operational.

The Government is committed to setting the UK firmly on course towards a green and growing economy. The transition to a green economy presents significant growth opportunities for UK-based businesses, both at home and abroad. This progression requires unprecedented investment in key green sectors. The UK GIB will be uniquely placed to facilitate the transition to a green economy base by addressing the market failures affecting green infrastructure projects. These failures have led to significant under investment in the key areas required to deliver this transition. Capitalised with £3 billion, the GIB will complement other green policies to help accelerate additional capital in green infrastructure.

State aid approval from the European Commission allows the Bank to make investments, on commercial terms, across the following sectors:

Priority sectors:  
- Offshore wind  
- Waste (treatment and recycling and energy from waste)  
- Non domestic energy efficiency

Other sectors:  
- Biofuels for transport  
- Biomass power  
- Carbon capture and storage  
- Marine energy  
- Renewable heat

The Department for Energy and Climate Change is in discussion with the European Commission separately to seek state aid approval for the longer term financing arrangements for the UK's Green Deal initiative.

The UK GIB will be based in Edinburgh and London. Its headquarters will be located in Edinburgh, with an office in London. This arrangement will enable a greater commercial reach nationally than could be achieved from one location.

The Channel 3 licences are held by ITV in England, Wales, the Channel Islands and the south of Scotland, STV in the central belt and northern Scotland and UTV in Northern Ireland. The Channel 5 licence is held by Northern & Shell.

The DCMS decision means Ofcom will now be asked to start discussions with the licence holder on the cost and terms of renewals.

The Culture Secretary has written to the regulator and highlighted a number of issues to be looked at as part of the process. Research by OFCOM in the south of Scotland shows continued support for  ITV providing the service there. However, under proposals advanced by ITV, viewers in the south of Scotland would not receive the same level of programming about Scotland as those in the northern and central parts of the country and the Culture Secretary has asked to see a way forward that addresses this issue for viewers in the Border  TV region in Scotland.

Areva plan to build a factory making blades and nacelles for offshore wind turbines and for use as a base for installing them in the North Sea, creating 750 jobs and many more in the supply chain.

Prime Minister, David Cameron, said:

""I warmly welcome AREVA's announcement today which is brilliant news for Scotland. I am determined that Britain competes and thrives in the global race and this shows that the UK remains an attractive place for foreign investment. Growth of the renewable energy sector isn't just good for our environment, it's good for our economy too, and with more renewable energy deployed under three years of this Coalition Government than under 13 years of the previous Government, the UK is now the world's biggest offshore wind market.

""Scotland benefits from UK wide initiatives to promote renewables and access to the entire UK consumer market. The Coalition Government has introduced the world's first and only Green Investment Bank, which, based in Edinburgh and London, is an example of one of the many ways in which we are stronger together, harnessing our combined strengths to become a world leader. In addition to the economic security that comes from being part of one of the world's most successful unions, this makes Scotland an obvious place for companies like AREVA to invest in.""

The Secretary of State for Scotland, Michael Moore MP welcomed the news of Areva's investment in Scotland. He said:

""I am delighted Areva has shown confidence and commitment in investing in Scotland. Not only are they creating jobs in the Scottish economy, they are helping to secure our future energy sources and promote the green economy.""

Areva's announcement is the latest sign that the UK is set to reap the economic benefits of being at the forefront of low carbon energy. This inward investment will support 750 jobs and bring wider benefits to Scotland and the UK economy.

""With the biggest market in the world, a world-class skills base, and one of the best natural wind resources available anywhere, the UK is extremely well-placed to continue to lead the world in developing this technology.""

John Hayes, Minister of State for Energy, said:

""Energy is at the heart of all that we do. It is central to our economic well-being, providing heat and light to support our endeavours. Offshore wind power has tremendous potential to deliver highly-skilled, long term, sustainable employment across the country.  
 

""I welcome Areva's commitment to offshore wind in this country and I look forward to discussing their plans further in the months ahead.""

It is expected that this factory will form part of a wider cluster of offshore wind manufacturing facilities, supporting wider industry ambitions on both cost reduction and supply chain development. It will be a central part of Areva's multi-site strategy for offshore wind manufacturing.

The announcement marks the beginning of detailed planning by the company to take forward its plans.

"Exports from the North East can help Scotland work its way back to economic prosperity, the Secretary of State for Scotland said today (Friday 16 November).

Michael Moore, who was visiting the region today, said it had an important role to play in supporting Scotland as it deals with challenging economic conditions around the globe.

He said the UK Government is committed to encouraging exports from across Scotland through its international support network for firms of all sizes.

The Minister was speaking as UKTI's Export Week draws to a close. It has seen a series of events to help Scottish exporters, including Advice Clinics in Edinburgh, Dundee and Glasgow and workshops on specific markets.

A focus on exports is essential to Scotland, which sold goods and services worth around £22 billion to markets around the world in 2010, excluding the rest of the UK. That includes business worth £9.8 billion in the European Union and £3.7 billion in North America. The rest of the UK remains a key market worth almost £45 billion.

The latest export figures from the Scottish Index of Manufactured Exports showed exports fell by 4.0 per cent in real terms during the second quarter of 2012 although the volume of manufactured exports grew by 1.7 per cent year-on-year.

Michael Moore said: ""There is no doubting the importance of exports to Scotland and we need to give every firm, from the biggest multinational to the smallest SME, as much help as we can as they reach out to new markets. Scotland is already open for business with the world but there is much more we can do to take our world-class services and goods to more countries.

""As part of the UK, Scotland can match its diverse sectors - whether manufacturing, finance or food and drink -  to a unique and powerful network of embassies, consuls and offices across the world which can offer support and market intelligence to help companies pinpoint their exports. It is an invaluable asset to firms in the North East and across Scotland.""

In the North-East, key sectors such as oil and gas supply chain and whisky underpin the region's export strategy, worth around £6 billion and £4.2 billion respectively.

The Scottish Secretary said the UK Government had a highly developed network which could help Scottish exporters find opportunities in both established and emerging markets around the world.

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has a global diplomatic network of around 270 posts in 170 countries, employing 14,000 staff, while UK Trade and Investment assists thousands of businesses to exploit trade opportunities.

"The Secretary of State for Scotland was in France today to inaugurate a Charles Rennie Mackintosh Trail in the Pyrenees Orientales.

It features 30 reproductions of landscapes by the renowned Scottish artist and architect  which are situated in the area he painted them, including the Tet and Tech Valleys. He moved to the town of  Port-Vendres in 1923.

Michael Moore also unveiled a bronze relief of the artist  by the British sculptor Jane Robbins.  

It is thought around 50,000 visitors a year will visit the three interpretation The Rennie Mackintosh Trail centres. The project is the brainchild of the Scottish film producer Robin Crichton.

"Unemployment in Scotland increased by 4,000, to 218,000 in the period July to September 2012, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) data released today. The Scottish unemployment rate is 8.1 per cent, which is above the average of 7.8 per cent for the whole of the UK.

The labour market statistics also show employment in Scotland has fallen by 27,000 over the three months July to September 2012. The number of those in employment in Scotland now stands at 2,472,000.

The Scotland Office Minister David Mundell said:

""The UK Government has taken decisive steps to stabilise our economy and has secured the UK as a relative safe haven while maintaining market confidence. We are also investing in Scotland - from energy infrastructure through DECC, broadband for rural areas, enhanced capital allowances, manufacturing research at Scottish universities and Royal Navy ships, to measures to stimulate millions in new investment for the North sea oil and gas fields.  
   
""It is a cause for obvious concern that the latest Scottish figures show another increase in unemployment while it is falling in the rest 'of the UK. The fact the Scottish unemployment rate is also higher than the rest of the country shows why Scotland' two governments need to work together for the benefit of Scotland.

""Today's figures are a reminder we must redouble our efforts to rebalance the economy and get people back into sustainable jobs. Each one of these statistics represents a person or a family affected by serious economic conditions across the globe and we must do all we can to help them.""

The Government is also supporting people in Scotland through the £1bn Youth Contract and the Get Britain Working measures which includes work clubs, supporting people into volunteering and work experience, enterprise clubs and the New Enterprise Allowance.

"Michael Moore told the SCDI International Awards Dinner that  Britain and the US are the largest investors in each other's economies and enjoy the largest Foreign Direct Investment relationship in the world.  The Minister added the UK would look to build on that trading relationship next year and strengthen trade links.

The Scottish Secretary also introduced the event's main speaker, Dr Madeleine Albright, the distinguished US ambassador to the UN, and later the first female Secretary of State, becoming the highest-ranking woman in US Government history. 

The Minister said: ""Raising awareness of Scotland's capabilities is just one of the reasons why working with organisations like SCDI is essential - not just for Government - but any company with an interest in international business.

""Last year I experienced SCDI's expertise first hand when I led Scotland¿s biggest trade mission to Brazil. We want to see UK exports to Brazil double by 2015.  The trade mission allowed Scottish companies to showcase their services and establish links in this key high-growth market. 

""This is a time of real international uncertainty and instability and the United Kingdom is not immune to what is going on in its biggest export markets.Ongoing difficulties in the Eurozone, and the wider global economy, present challenges as we attempt to rebalance our economy and our public finances, and build a better future.

""We welcome last month's UK GDP figures showing a return to growth in the third quarter of this year. But weak global confidence and nervous financial markets mean that we cannot be complacent. That is why the UK Government, has made it a priority to set out an unequivocal message to our international partners:

""Britain is open for business, open to innovators and entrepreneurs,open to investment. Boosting export levels for both goods and services is one part of the picture - and that's why, in the UK, we are aiming to increase our exports to £1 trillion annually by 2020.

""No other relationship demonstrates the power of international links than our special relationship with the United States.The facts speak for themselves. Britain and the US are the largest investors in each other's economies; enjoying the largest Foreign Direct Investment relationship in the world. 

""UK companies currently provide employment for around one million people in the US - roughly the same figure as American companies in Britain.In 2010 alone, Scotland exported an estimated £3.5 billion of goods and services to the US, and we must continue to build on that success. But I believe our relationship holds even greater potential.Scottish, UK and indeed EU wide-recovery will go hand-in-hand with that in America.

""As free-trading, outward-looking, democratic nations our futures remain intertwined. We have the prospect next year of establishing a free trade agreement between the EU and the US that will build on the strong trade links that we already have between the UK and the US. 

""We share a commitment to innovation and entrepreneurship.Together, we can create new jobs, business and prosperity for all our peoples.""

"Michael Moore helped launch the Charity Speakers for Schools in Scotland today, when he gave a talk to around 100 pupils at his former school Jedburgh Grammar in the Scottish Borders.

The charity will hold a series of talks in state secondary schools around the country and leaders in Scottish business, media culture, academia and politics have pledged to give a talk to students in a state secondary school once a year to raise aspirations and broaden horizons.

It is the idea of BBC Business Editor, Robert Peston, who wants young people in state schools and colleges to have the same opportunities to hear from inspirational speakers as those who attend top independent schools. The idea is to level the playing field and for it to become the norm for leaders in their fields to give talks in state schools and colleges. Speakers for Schools was launched in England in October 2011 and is administered by small charity the Education and Employers Taskforce.

The Minister said: ""It was a great honour to give one of Scotland's first Speakers for School talks, and I am sure we can build on the success of this great initiative elsewhere in the UK. I am particularly happy to help launch the charity at Jedburgh Grammar School - where I was at school - in my own Borders constituency. Young people today face many challenges and in a world full of uncertainties it is essential we give them the benefit of our collective experience to help guide their decisions for the future. The list of speakers is both distinguished and broad and I have no doubt pupils across Scotland will benefit from the advice on offer.""

"A Bill designed to close the legal loophole allowing partnerships to evade prosecution by dissolving, as happened in the Rosepark fire in Uddingston, was introduced to the House of Lords by the Advocate General for Scotland Lord Wallace of Tankerness  yesterday (Monday 5 November).

The House of Lords gave the Partnerships (Prosecution) (Scotland) Bill its First Reading at Westminster.

It is the first wholly Scottish Bill to be introduced at Westminster since 2004, making it the third since devolution to have Scotland-only extent.

It takes forward the Scottish Law Commission's proposals  to reform the criminal liability of partnerships in Scots law.

The issue came into focus following the death of 14 elderly residents in a fire at the  Rosepark nursing home in Lanarkshire in 2004. The Crown Office made three separate attempts to prosecute those alleged to be responsible but the case failed because of the loophole which prevented the prosecution of a partnership once it had been dissolved.

The Scottish Law Commission undertook an assessment of that legal anomaly and suggested a number of proposals to address it. The Bill present a sound, but simple, way to ensure that partnerships - and culpable members - can no longer escape prosecution by dissolving.

The Advocate General the Lord Wallace of Tankerness QC said:

""I am very pleased the Bill has arrived at this important stage. It is the product of much collaborative effort between the UK Government and the Scottish Law Commission. We have also worked closely with the Crown Office who support the Bill.  
¿The Rosepark fire was a terrible tragedy, compounded by the fact prosecutors were unable to find a legal basis to bring those responsible for the deaths of 14 vulnerable people to justice. Closing this loophole is important and it will ensure no one will have to endure the same frustrations as the bereaved families in this case in future. Simply dissolving a partnership will no longer put you beyond prosecution.

""The Bill demonstrates the ability and commitment of the UK Government to take forward Scottish legislation at Westminster to ensure the law for which it is responsible is effective.""

Lady Clark of Calton, the Chairman of the Scottish Law Commission, said:  ""I am delighted at the introduction of this Bill.   The Bill will  implement important recommendations of the Scottish Law Commission to reform  Scots law on the criminal liability of partnerships.  The Commission and the UK Government have worked together closely in order to bring forward this vital legislative measure.""

The UK Government began a consultation on the issue of the criminal liability of partnerships in April this year.

"Firms in Scotland will have access to a wider global network for trade and diplomacy after the UK Government announced it was opening a new British Embassy in Laos.

William Hague announced the news while making the first ever visit to the country by a British Foreign Secretary. The trip follows the Prime Minister's visit to Asia in April.

The move reflects the UK Government's determinations to build stronger relationships with  Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The UK is now one of only three European countries to have an Embassy in every one of the 10 nations of ASEAN.

The Scottish Secretary Michael Moore said: ""Scotland's businesses and residents already benefit from the UK's diplomatic, consular and trade networks across the globe, which promotes and protects the interests of the UK, its citizens and firms.

""Being part of the UK means we have access to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's network of around 270 diplomatic posts in 170 countries, and its 14,000 staff. It is also expanding into new areas as we can see from the new British Embassy in Laos.

""In trade terms, UK Trade and Investment has 162 offices in 96 countries and can draw on the UK's diplomatic representation throughout the world.

""One of the big questions facing Scotland ahead of the referendum is the effect leaving the UK would have on an independent Scotland's global reach and influence. The prospect of losing access to these global networks can only harm business confidence.

The Foreign Secretary William Hague said: ""ASEAN countries are at the centre of Asia's rise. They represent 600 million people; absorb more UK exports than mainland China or India; and are predicted to be the world's fourth-largest single market by 2030. This is therefore an excellent moment to be opening an Embassy and starting a new era in our relations.""

While in Laos the Foreign Secretary will represent the UK at the Asia-Europe Summit. He will call for vigorous engagement in Asia by the European Union as a whole, particularly in championing free trade agreements, lowering barriers to trade, and forging closer cooperation in the areas of security and disaster preparedness.

""We continue to stand tall in the world, with Scots in the armed forces making the world a safer place by serving in Afghanistan and other countries. We are also working to bring an end to conflicts in places such as Syria and increase our national security through our active role in institutions such as UN and NATO.

""As a government we have increased our international aid budget and strengthened our diplomatic and trade networks around the world, using our embassies to help promote export and investment. This year will see the UK take the G8 Presidency and our influence at the top tables around the world will be as strong as ever.

""We have also seen Scotland's two governments work together constructively. We have overseen the biggest transfer of financial power in three centuries to the Scottish Parliament through the Scotland Act, alongside a range of other powers such as control of drink drive limits and air weapons. We have also negotiated a fair, legal and decisive referendum on independence.

""We are looking forward to taking on the challenges of the next two and a half years with the same dedication we have shown so far and will continue working to protect and strengthen our country, its citizens and families.""

"The combination of a landmark free trade agreement (FTA) with Singapore and the benefits offered by the UK's diplomatic, consular and trade networks will provide Scottish businesses with a platform to expand into Southeast Asia, the Secretary of State for Scotland has said today.

 

On Sunday, EU Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht and Singapore's Minister of Trade and Industry Lim Hng Kiang, completed final negotiations on a FTA between the European Union (EU) and Singapore.  This is the second agreement with a key Asian trading partner, after the EU-Korea FTA, which has been in operation since July 2011.

 

Approximately 40 Scottish companies have operations in Singapore with another 200 being involved in joint ventures.  It is one of the largest export markets for Scotland outside of Europe with some £245m worth of goods exported there each year.  A number of Singapore's key business sectors for development such as financial services, life sciences, marine and offshore engineering are areas in which Scotland has significant expertise.

 

The UK is one of only three European countries to have an Embassy in every one of the 10 nations of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) of which Singapore is a member.  UK Trade and Investment with 162 offices in 96 countries also has a significant footprint in Southeast Asia.

 

The Secretary of State said:

 

""This free trade agreement is excellent news for Scotland.  There are already significant economic benefits being made by Scottish businesses in Singapore and this agreement will only encourage further gains to be made.  Scotland's businesses benefit from the UK's diplomatic, consular and trade networks across the world and this will provide a platform for Scottish companies to expand their operations into Southeast Asia"".

"The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore has welcomed the extension of the Youth Contract in Scotland.

The Youth Contract is a package of support from the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) worth almost £1 billion to help young unemployed people between 18 and 24 years old prepare for work and find a job. Wage incentives allow employers to claim up to £2,275 when they take on a young person who has been out of work for some time, helping businesses to cover the costs of national insurance contributions or fund extra training or supervision whilst giving a young person an opportunity to work.

Secretary of State Michael Moore said:

""I welcome this extension to the £1bn Youth Contract as youth unemployment is a serious cause for concern across Scotland. Recently I visited Kilbirnie in North Ayrshire to discuss the issues facing young people there. North Ayrshire was one of the hotspots nominated by DWP for extra support for young people and I am encouraged that young people throughout Scotland will now benefit from the increased opportunities wage incentives bring.

""It is essential we help our young people get a foot on to the jobs ladder. through extending wage incentives; work experience opportunities and extra jobcentre adviser support.""

Wage incentives were previously available for the long term unemployed through the Work Programme or to young people who had been on unemployment benefit for more than six months in three unemployment hotspot areas in Scotland: Clackmannanshire; North Ayrshire and West Dunbartonshire. From today the incentives will be available nationwide. DWP are also making extra Jobcentre adviser time available for young people in the hotspot areas at the start of their claim, so these areas continue to receive more support. For the first three months, young jobseekers will get an average of 80 minutes extra time every fortnight to help them prepare for and find work.

Free trade between the UK and the US is essential to economic recovery and prosperity in both countries, the Secretary of State for Scotland told an American business audience in Washington D.C. earlier today.

There are still a number of significant barriers to trade and the UK is committed to the EU and US launching negotiations around a transatlantic free trade agreement in 2013. The EU-US High Level Working Group will report on this issue before the end of the year. The creation of such an agreement is one of the UK Government's top trade priorities and would help promote growth and jobs in both economies.

Michael Moore told a breakfast meeting of the British American Business Association the US and Scotland had established and maintained historic trade links which have grown to the point where the US is our second largest export market following the rest of Europe.

The UK is the US' fifth largest trading partner and one in six of every pound created by UK exports comes from trade with the US.  Last year Scotland exported around £3 billion of goods to the US market.

The Minister stressed the importance of the relationship for Scotland, saying the UK and the US are the largest investors in each other's economies.

They enjoy the largest foreign direct investment relationship in the world and British companies support around 1 million jobs in the US, roughly the same amount as American companies operating in Britain.

The Minister, who is visiting the US and Canada this week to promote Scottish interests and trade, told the association it was vital for the UK to build on its trading relationship with the US to help underpin our economic recovery.

Michael Moore said:

""The UK and US continue to gain strength from one another. Our common values, goals and language make us natural trading partners and our relationship has gone from strength to strength over the years.  We cannot be complacent especially as we are so interlinked at an economic level, providing millions of jobs through investment in our respective countries.

""The UK Government wants to see that relationship lead to more prosperity and growth in the coming years. The transformation of the UK's tax and regulatory environment coupled with a focused industrial strategy is sending a clear message to the world that the UK is open for business - and a great place to invest.

""A transatlantic free trade agreement with the US would be very positive for both the EU and US, liberalising our markets and could bring economic benefits similar in scale to the creation of the Single Market. Although tariffs between us are relatively low, the scale of our trade last year alone illustrates the scale of potential gains for companies in Scotland and throughout the UK. ""

"Passengers and businesses in Scotland will benefit from increased airline competition, the Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore has said today as he welcomed the news Virgin Atlantic will operate a domestic flying programme from spring 2013, providing additional routes from Aberdeen and Edinburgh to Heathrow.

From April 2013, the airline will operate six round-trip flights a day between Heathrow and Edinburgh, with three daily round-trip flights between Heathrow and Aberdeen as part of a new domestic network. These routes will provide an alternative to existing British Airways services operating in Scotland and extend Virgin's long haul network, creating around 150 jobs in the UK.

The Secretary of State said:

""Today's announcement by Virgin Atlantic is good news for Scotland and will create meaningful, sustainable competition to existing routes. These services operating from Edinburgh and Aberdeen will provide direct links to and from London Heathrow as well as seamlessly linking into Virgin's long-haul network creating new links between Scotland and the rest of the world. Together this will only benefit Scotland's business and leisure travellers"".

"Scotland's interests in Europe are made with real clout and influence as part of the UK, the Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore has said today on his return from Brussels following meetings with a number of significant figures within the European Union.

Mr Moore met with the Commissioner for Regional Policy, Johannes Hahn, to discuss the economic outlook for Scotland. The Secretary of State placed importance on the need to ensure that the regulations, and interpretation of them, are harmonised as much as possible across all the structural funds, so that they can be implemented as flexibly as possible to achieve the greatest impact across Scotland.

The Secretary of State discussed Scotland's significant marine energy potential and briefed the Commissioner for Energy, Gunther Oettinger, on the recent UK Green Investment Bank launch, highlighting the opportunities the bank offers for Scottish companies to receive significant capital to fund green energy projects. This could in turn allow for greater cross collaboration with European counterparts.

The bank received state aid approval from the European Commission last month and is now operational as an independent bank.

Mr Moore also stressed to Commissioner Oettinger that EU's proposals for offshore oil and gas safety should be on the basis of a Directive instead of a binding Regulation and welcomed their agreement to continue negotiations on that basis.

Mr Moore then met with the senior EU official on agriculture Georg Hausler to discuss Scotland's priorities on agriculture. This followed on from a meeting in September with Commissioner for Agriculture Dacian Ciolos in Edinburgh.

The Secretary of State said: ""Scotland's voice in Europe is louder and our priorities are heard as part of the United Kingdom. The meetings I undertook today provided the opportunity to ensure Scotland's interests are made with real clout and influence at a European level. Across Scotland we are stronger and clearer when we speak with one voice and through the UK as one of the world's leading economies, we have the means to influence Europe's key decision makers and negotiate the best possible deal.""

"Opt-outs from EU border rules and the Euro which the UK fought hard to negotiate would be back on the EU negotiating table if Scotland became independent, Scottish Secretary Michael Moore said today as he visited Brussels.

Mr Moore stressed that the outcome of any negotiations would be far from certain and that Scotland would no longer enjoy the negotiating clout that comes from being one of the EU's largest members.

Speaking in Brussels, where he is holding talks with the EU Commissioners for Regional Policy and for Energy, Michael Moore said:

""I am here in Brussels making the case for Scotland as part of the UK.  We speak with a strong voice as part of one of the largest EU countries.

""Our negotiating clout has delivered the UK and Scotland important opt-outs from EU border controls and the Euro currency. If Scotland was to become independent then these benefits and everything else would be up for grabs as we embarked on negotiating a whole new set of terms with the rest of the EU. The outcome of these negotiations would be far from certain. What would be certain is that Scotland would be negotiating from a much weaker position having lost the clout that comes from being part of one of the largest EU members.

""John Swinney said today that Scotland would have to negotiate the details and terms of Scotland's EU membership. What we really need to know is how  they will sort out the Schengen agreement?

""How will they negotiate an opt-out from the Euro? No new member state has joined since 2005 without a clear commitment to join. The Scottish Government cannot wish these problems away.

""They certainly cannot assume that they will be able to negotiate the same conditions that the UK enjoys. Many of these were hard-won and controversial. Negotiations would be very complex and would involve compromise. The Scottish Government need to get real and accept that there are no guarantees on how any such negotiations would unfold.""

"The UK Government's action to protect the economy and growth will today help a range of people and sectors across Scotland, including a multi-million pound boost for capital spending. 

The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore said:

""Against a difficult economic backdrop, we are taking the targeted measures we can afford to get Scotland's economy moving.

""There is a good deal of specific, positive news for Scotland. 

""The Scottish Government will receive more than £300 million of new money - in addition to the £1 billion it has already received since the Spending Review - all of which it can invest in shovel-ready projects.

""Our 2.7 million vehicle owners - particularly those in rural Scotland - will benefit from the decision to cancel the January fuel duty rise.

""And an additional 21,000 low income Scots will be taken out of tax altogether next April, bringing the number in Scotland to 183,000 in total, with around two million more receiving an income tax cut.  Fairer taxes are essential at this time of economic strain, and that is what we are delivering."" 

""Business will also benefit, whether from the Annual Investment Allowance increase, a reduction in corporation tax or new allowances for the North Sea oil and gas fields. The news that Perth and Aberdeen are to benefit from UK Government funding for broadband will also help prepare Scotland for the challenges ahead.

""The Autumn Statement makes clear we are on the right track in terms of borrowing and deficit reduction, despite the troubles on our doorstep in the eurozone. The UK Government will continue to take the right decision for our economy, allowing Scotland and the rest of the UK to compete and grow. ""

In Edinburgh today, The Secretary of State for Scotland, Michael Moore met with Ian McGregor, Chief Executive of PoppyScotland, Manager Charlie Henning and members of staff from Lady Haig's  Poppy Factory to take delivery of the cards.

Poppyscotland was founded in 1921 as The Earl Haig Fund Scotland and now raises over £2m each year to provide financial assistance to thousands of ex-Servicemen and women as well as helping to fund specialist services such as long term care, housing and employment.  Dover House, the London headquarters of the Scotland Office hosts the annual PoppyScotland launch.

 

The original Lady Haig Poppy Factory was opened in March 1926, employing those who had been disabled during World War 1 to make poppies for Scotland, it currently has a work force of 40 ex-Servicemen producing around 5 million poppies by hand each year.

 

Michael Moore said:  ""It is a privilege to highlight Poppyscotland's excellent work by using their design for this year's Scotland Office Christmas card.

 

""The year-round work which Poppyscotland undertakes helping the thousands of ex-Servicemen and women, and their families in Scotland is to be commended.  It is especially poignant at this time of year to pay tribute to the work they are doing helping those who have experienced physical, emotional or financial difficulties since leaving the Armed Forces""

 

Poppyscotland Chief Executive Ian McGregor said: ""We are very pleased that the Secretary of State has chosen one of Poppyscotland's designs for his official Christmas card this year. Although our main fundraising drive is in November, our work continues all year round and our Christmas cards provide an ideal opportunity to support Scotland's Armed Forces community at this special time of year.""

"The UK Government will only proceed with their radical plans to strengthen Scottish devolution ""with the formal and explicit consent of the Scottish Parliament"", Scottish Secretary Michael Moore confirmed in the House of Commons today.

Opening the debate on the 2nd Reading of the Scotland Bill, Mr Moore told MPs that the Coalition Government's legislation amounted to the largest transfer of fiscal powers from London since the creation of the UK. He said it would fundamentally change the powers and responsibilities of the Scottish Parliament and, for that reason, could only happen with the agreement of the Holyrood.

The 2nd Reading debate in the House of Commons is the start of the UK Parliament's scrutiny of the Scotland Bill. The Scottish Parliament established a Scotland Bill Committee in December to study the Bill in detail. The Scottish Parliament is expected to vote on a Legislative Consent Motion for the Scotland Bill in March.

The Scotland Bill is the UK Government's legislation to implement the recommendations of the Calman Commission which examined ways to strengthen devolution in Scotland.

If supported by the UK and Scottish Parliaments, the Scotland Bill will mean that:

  * MSPs at Holyrood will have to set a Scottish rate of income tax each year and will be responsible for raising a much greater proportion (around 35%) of the revenue they spend.
  * The Scottish Parliament with get borrowing powers of £2.7bn
  * The Scottish Parliament will have responsibility for stamp duty, landfill tax and the ability to propose new taxes.
  * Policy responsibility in areas such as air weapons, drink drive limits and speed limits will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament and Scottish Government.
  * A Scottish Cash Reserve will be created to bank and save money where tax receipts exceed those expected.

Opening the 2nd Reading debate in the House of Commons, Scottish Secretary Michael Moore said:

""We have a Parliament in Scotland that can determine policy on a wide range of subjects.  It can determine how and where money is spent.  But at present it cannot be held effectively to account for raising the money it spends

""The Scotland Bill addresses that imbalance by providing a package of taxation and borrowing powers that will see the Scottish Parliament become accountable for over a third of the money it spends. In doing so, the Bill represents the largest transfer of fiscal powers from central government since the creation of the United Kingdom. 

""It is a radical but responsible step. Most significantly, we will create a Scottish income tax.  We will create that tax by cutting 10 pence off the basic, higher and 50 pence tax rates for Scottish taxpayers, adjusting the block grant in proportion, and allowing the Scottish Parliament - indeed, obliging it - to reset those rates at a level of their choosing.

""This will give Scottish Ministers and the Scottish Parliament a much more significant stake in the performance of the Scottish economy.  The level of the Scottish rate will be Scotland's to decide.  And those who set the rates will answer directly to those affected by them. Power will rest with the Scottish people.

""Mr Speaker, this is the first time since the creation of devolution that a Government has brought forward legislation with such wide-ranging effect on the current settlement. Indeed, this Bill will fundamentally change the powers and responsibilities of the Scottish Parliament. 

""For that reason, this Government will only proceed with this Bill with the formal and explicit consent of the Scottish Parliament.

""It is right and proper that the Scottish Parliament should examine the measures that we set out in the Scotland Bill.  I welcome the thorough way in which it is going about its business.  And I look forward to returning to discuss the provisions with the Bill committee in the Scottish Parliament next week.""

"Michael Moore meets energy companies to discuss social tariffs

The UK Government has spent over £50 million to help some of the most vulnerable in Scotland cope with the recent cold snap, the Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore announced revealed today.

At the Spending Review in October the Coalition Government turned the temporary increase in the Cold Weather Payments by the last government into a permanent increase.  The payments of £25 per week are triggered when temperatures at local weather stations dip below an average of zero degrees over a week.

There have been just over two million separate cold weather payments in Scotland between 23 November 2010 and 18 January 2011, totalling around £52.3 million of financial assistance to disabled adults and children, the elderly and families with young children who receive an income related benefit. Around 437,500 individuals in Scotland have received help from the payment scheme at a time when help is needed most.

The Secretary of State said:

""The Coalition Government is committed to supporting the vulnerable in Scotland and the cold weather payments are just one example of the steps we are taking to make sure people can cope with difficult weather conditions. The £52 million Scots have received is money well spent.

""My discussions with the big six energy companies were very useful and I pressed home the importance of maintaining social tariffs to protect those who need most help with their bills. I also know families and businesses have concerns over rising energy costs and we will continue to work with the energy companies closely.""

Many eligible people across Scotland will also have received Winter Fuel Allowance payments, which will also help them at this difficult time of year.

Michael Moore has been working closely with the Energy Secretary on the introduction of the Warm Front Discount scheme which also forms part of the Government's broader proposals for helping vulnerable customers.

During December, the Secretary of State discussed pricing and social tariffs with senior executives of SSE, Eon, EDF, RWE npower, Scottish Gas and ScottishPower.

The Secretary of State discussed the responsibility of the companies to assist their most vulnerable customers with manageable energy costs and the need to publicise the assistance available.

"The Scottish Secretary Michael Moore has invited the leaders of Edinburgh and Glasgow Councils to talks with the Secretary of State for Transport about bringing high speed rail to Scotland.

The UK Government has announced plans to create a High Speed Rail network to increase rail capacity, reduce journey times and to achieve this while meeting our climate change objectives.

Mr Moore has previously held separate talks with both Edinburgh and Glasgow leaders to discuss  how the high speed rail network can extend to Scotland. The Scottish Secretary has set up talks with the Transport Secretary, Philip Hammond so that the cities can make their case directly to him. The meeting is scheduled to take place in the House of Commons tomorrow (Wednesday) afternoon.

Speaking ahead of the meeting Michael Moore said:

""The new high speed network being  planned by the Coalition Government will reduce rail journey times to London. Edinburgh and Glasgow are working hard to make the technical case for high speed rail coming to Scotland. I have heard what the leaders of those cities have to say and I am committed to helping them  develop their case inside the UK Government.

""I have set up today's meeting at the House of Commons so that Philip Hammond can understand the benefits our two major cities believe high speed rail can deliver for them. I believe it is a useful opportunity to explore the progress that is being made and what the next steps need to be.""

Jenny Dawe and Gordon Matheson will attend the meeting and are the leaders of Edinburgh and Glasgow councils respectively.

"Scotland will continue to play a key role in the defence of the UK, the Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore said after a visit to HM Naval Base Clyde today (Thursday 6 January).

The Minister met key personnel to learn more about operations at Scotland's largest military establishment. The base has a staff of over 7000 and is the single largest site employer in Scotland.

The base is home to the UK's nuclear deterrent as well as conventionally-armed submarines and mine-sweeping vessels. The flotilla includes the first of the Astute Class attack submarines as well as the Vanguard submarines that maintain the country's continuous at sea nuclear deterrent.

HM Naval Base Clyde will take on a further role as home to the Trafalgar Class attack submarines following the MoD's maritime Change Programme Announcement. It also provides specialist maritime and nuclear engineering support as well as one of the world's largest Shiplift facilities, capable of lifting a 16,000 tonne Vanguard Class submarine out of the water for maintenance.

The Secretary of State toured these facilities and a submarine where he spoke to personnel and heard about the future plans for the site.

The Minister said:

""Faslane is proof of the UK Government's ongoing commitment to a defence footprint in Scotland. I was once again impressed by the professionalism and dedication of the armed forces who work on the base and its vessels.

""Not only does the base provide world-class facilities and expertise, it is also of huge strategic importance in the defence of the UK. It is the single largest site of employment in Scotland and the fact it is to become the main operating base for all of our submarine fleet underlines the important role it plays.

""The defence review has produced a number of challenges in Scotland, particularly surrounding the future of RAF bases. Decisions will be made later this year but it is clear Scotland will continue play a key part in defending our country long into the future.""

The Minister took the opportunity to hear the concerns of the business community following a visit to a local business.

He said: ""I was glad to have the chance to visit the North-east of Scotland and speak to businesses and members of the Chamber to hear not only their concerns but also their successes.

""As well as addressing the Chamber, I also had the chance to visit the family-run food business Macphie of Glenbervie to hear first-hand from one important sector in this area.

""The region is at the heart of Scotland's economy and will play a key part in our recovery. It is clear the private sector, including the ever-important oil and gas industry, is going to lead the way in creating the growth this government has set as its priority.

"Emerging world markets and innovation by Scottish companies are key to securing Scotland's economy in the future, the Secretary of State for Scotland heard on a visit to Glasgow today (Wednesday 23 February).

Michael Moore toured the family-owned McLaren Packaging at Port Glasgow to meet the management and staff and hear about the challenges facing the firm, which employs over 60 people and has an annual turnover of around £9m.

He met the father-and-son team Jim and Donald McLaren, key operational and commercial staff and was given a tour of the factory before discussing steps the UK Government was taking to support business in Scotland.

The award-winning firm benefits indirectly from Scotch Whisky's strong position in the international market as it has supplied packaging to the drinks industry since 1978. It currently supplies around 20 million cases each year.

Issues facing the company and Scottish industry were also raised during the visit, including price inflation affecting the cost of raw material and fuel prices and their impact on the transportation of goods.

The Secretary of State said:

""The Scottish economy is full of businesses that know the way to secure future growth is to look for opportunities both in the domestic market but also in growing foreign economies.

""McLaren Packaging is a prime example of the positive effects exports to the emerging and established foreign markets can have on the Scottish supply chain. In this case it is based on the success story of Scotch Whisky, but the same applies to companies operating across a wide range of sectors. The UK Government is also tackling the issue of protecting the Scotch Whisky brand internationally through geographical indication of origin status.

""The private sector is absolutely essential to the UK's recovery and as a government we are working hard to create the right mix of stability and flexibility to allow companies to innovate and grow both profit and jobs.

""I listened closely to the range of issues the company raised on behalf of its sector and will feed those back into government.""

McLaren Packaging was founded in 1978 by Jim McLaren and remains a family owned business based in Port Glasgow.  It is a specialist supplier to the drinks industry and has grown and diversified to supply corrugate cases, solidboard divisions, composite tubes, packing machinery and associated packs.

The UK Government has introduced a rolling programme of  Growth Review, which was announced last year.  It will consider what each part of government is doing to provide the conditions for private sector success and tackle the barriers faced by industry.

The Government is seeking to remove some of the most entrenched barriers to growth that cut across most businesses such as looking at how we change and improve the planning system, competition policy, regulation, trade and inward investment, access to finance and corporate governance.

"The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore met children from the Big Noise Orchestra today to see how music is helping to bring the local community together.

Speaking after the visit Mr Moore said that the Big Noise Orchestra is proving to be a great way of bringing the local community together, whilst also helping the children improve their confidence, teamwork, pride and aspirations.

After watching the children practicing Mr Moore said:

""This is an innovative way to work with vulnerable and disabled children, helping develop pride in themselves and their communities.  The success of Sistema speaks for itself with performances at Edinburgh's Queens Hall and Stirling's Albert Hall as well as performances at Raploch.

""It was good to hear that this new and inspirational way of working with children will not be restricted to Raploch, and I look forward to seeing the Sistema organisation grow and prosper over the coming years.

""It is also great to see one of Scotland's greatest musicians, Nicola Benedetti, taking an active part in supporting the orchestra by becoming the official musical 'Big Sister'.""

Sistema Scotland is a charity set up in the belief that children can gain huge social benefits by playing in a symphony orchestra.  They take the name Sistema from the orchestra movement established in Venezuela and seek to benefit from the South Americans' expertise, while adapting their methods to suit conditions in Scotland.

Sistema Scotland exists to develop orchestra centres on the ground in Scotland. These are known in the community as Big Noise. The first is Raploch, Stirling. By 2013 they will open three children's orchestra centres.

"The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore has underlined the UK Government's commitment to supporting mountain rescue teams and the essential role they play in protecting the lives of the public.

Speaking on a visit to the  Highlands where he met the Glencoe Mountain Rescue team, the Minister said the safety of people climbing and touring in the Highlands is only protected by the dedication and bravery of specialised rescue personnel.

Moore said that the UK Government has made it clear it has listened to the concerns of rescue professionals over the cost of equipment.

He added that the Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander had told the Commons funds had been allocated to help mountain rescue teams with the issue and that the Department for Transport will make an announcement in due course.

The Secretary of State met the team's leader John Grieve and other members of staff at the Glencoe Rescue Centre to hear more about their work and the challenges they face and their plans for the future.

The Glencoe Mountain Rescue team is one of the longest established in Scotland and is set to celebrate its 50th anniversary this year.

Michael Moore said: ""The work of mountain rescue teams is a matter of life and death for those they help and the teams play a key role in very difficult circumstances.

""As a government, we are aware of their dedication to keeping the public safe and we have listened to their concerns. The Treasury has given a clear signal it will act to support mountain rescue teams and the details will come forward in the near future. This will help volunteers with the costs of their equipment and I am sure it will be welcomed.

"The Government has today written to the presiding officers of the Scottish Parliament and the National Assembly for Wales to give them the opportunity to signal whether they wish to vary the dates of their 2015 elections by up to a year.

The Scottish Parliament and the National Assembly for Wales will be asked to choose whether or not they would like to change the date of their elections so that they do not coincide with the date of the next general election to the House of Commons, which is set for 7 May 2015.

Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg, said:

""We want to ensure that election campaigns for the Scottish Parliament and the National Assembly for Wales can be distinctly separate from the build-up to, and aftermath of the 2015 Westminster election.

""But this is their choice to make ¿ they can hold it in May 2015 if they wish, or a year before or after if they prefer - as part of this Government's commitment to mutual respect, devolution of power and political accountability.""

Mark Harper, Minister for Political and Constitutional Reform, said:

""This follows several months of dialogue with the parties in the devolved legislatures. They have asked for this power and we think it is right to give them this choice.""

The Scottish Parliament and the National Assembly for Wales will need to pass a resolution, before they rise for this year's May elections, agreeing that the 2015 election should be moved on a one off basis to another date one year earlier or later than May 2015. The resolution must be passed with a two-thirds majority, which is consistent with provisions in the legislation establishing the devolved legislatures and in the Fixed-term Parliaments Bill for triggering an early general election. The Government would then be in a position to table an amendment to the Fixed-term Parliaments Bill which would, if accepted, make this change.

"The bank deal announced today by the UK Government could unlock additional lending of around £800 million for small businesses in Scotland, said the Scottish Secretary Michael Moore.

The Chancellor told the House of Commons that the Coalition Government has agreed that the major banks will increase lending to SMEs by £10 billion this year.

Mr Moore also said he was encouraged by meetings he had today with senior Scottish banking figures and that they understand what is expected of them.

Michael Moore said:

""The agreement reached with the banks today is good news for Scottish business. By increasing the lending to SMEs by 15 per cent this means that lending to Scottish business could now increase by around £800 million beyond current levels.  This will help Scottish companies to grow and create jobs.

""We are very serious about this. The Bank of England will monitor the performance of the banks in terms of their lending and the pay of bank bosses will be linked to these lending targets. If the banks don't come up with the lending then we have made clear that we reserve the right to take further action.

""The settlement also helps to increase transparency on bank pay and to curb large bonuses. This is what the public expects from the banks that they helped and I am pleased that we have been able to deliver with this strong settlement. Businesses are benefitting and in return the Government is committing to a strong, stable and resilient banking sector which is in everyone's interest.

""I met with a number of senior bankers today and it is clear that they understand what is expected of them. It is not us and the public versus the banks. The Government and the banks both want to see more lending, bonuses being curbed and the tax payers getting a return on their investment in Britain¿s banks.  If we work together, as we have been, then we can ensure that Scottish business, Scottish banks and Scottish households all emerge stronger.""

A delegation from the Edinburgh Green Investment Bank Group recently briefed MPs in the House of Commons before presenting the business case for locating the UK Green Investment Bank in Edinburgh to Michael Moore, the Secretary of State for Scotland.

The Group went on to meet the Business Secretary, Vince Cable, other Ministers and senior Treasury officials, where they presented the business case for Edinburgh.

The campaign also has the support of Scottish Renewables, Scottish Financial Enterprise, Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce, Scottish Council for Development and Industry, Scottish Chambers of Commerce, Scottish Development International and Scottish Enterprise.

The business case is based upon Edinburgh's expertise in financial services, education, research and development, as well as its growing reputation in renewable energy and low carbon technologies.

The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore said:

""I am aware of the hard work which has gone into preparing the business case for taking the Green Investment Bank to Edinburgh where it will be able to serve the whole of the UK.

""I have consistently said I think it makes sense to have it in Scotland because of the unique strengths we have in terms of finance sector, the energy industry and research and I will now look at the city's bid in detail.

""This government has made crystal clear that we will maintain direct payments to farmers in Scotland and, in particular, support for less favoured areas.

 

""The current round of CAP negotiations is an opportunity to reform, simplify and ¿green¿ the system, but in doing so we will negotiate hard on behalf of the industry to maintain its long-term health.""

 

On the issue of the Grocery Code Adjudicator, Moore added:

 

""We need to ensure that supermarket pricing is fair to farmers and consumers. It should be open, transparent and sustainable. That's why the Government has promised to bring forward plans for a ""supermarket ombudsman"". We were able to confirm at today's meeting that those plans are well under way and we will present our proposals over the coming months.""

Michael Moore said: ""Scotland has always been at the forefront of international development in the UK and DfID's offices in East Kilbride ensure this remains the case. Just under half of the UK based staff of DfID are based in Scotland doing vital work.

In these difficult economic times the coalition government's commitment to increase the levels of overseas aid remains unchanged. This is an important example of the core values of our nation. The ring-fencing of DifD's budget guarantee that we will continue to help those who need it most.""

Scottish servicemen and women are ""brave, committed and deserve the nation's support"" and making a huge contribution to the situation in Afghanistan, the Secretary of State for Scotland said after an official visit to troops in Helmand two weeks ago (from 14 March).

Michael Moore was in operational theatre to meet armed forces personnel from Scotland and across the UK  and  to discuss the challenges they face as they carry out their mission. He was briefed by senior military and civilian personnel on the strategy for Helmand and the work of the armed forces and civilian personnel.

He spent time in Camp Bastion and Lashkar Gah where he met senior commanders and Scottish troops from 2 SCOTS (Royal Highland Fusiliers) and 5 SCOTS (Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders) as well as RAF personnel and medical staff.

The Secretary of State said:

""It was humbling to meet the men and women  of our armed forces as they carry out an important and dangerous task in a very challenging environment. I met a wide range of Scots serving in Afghanistan and each of them showed a level of focus and professionalism which should make Scotland proud.

""They are among the bravest and most committed people you could meet and it was a privilege to spend some time with them. It is difficult for them being so far away from home and family but the way they go about their jobs is an example to us all.""

The Secretary of State's visit to Afghanistan follows an extensive programme of visits to Scotland's military bases. He has held numerous meetings with the Defence Secretary and other colleagues on defence matters and spoke to Liam Fox on his return from Helmand.

"Oil companies objecting to increased taxes is not surprising, says Scottish  Secretary Michael Moore, but  he insists that it is ""the right and fair thing to do"". 

Moore pointed to a North Sea profit forecast of £24bn in 2011-12 which is 50% higher than 2 years ago. He said it was fair to use some of these unexpectedly high profits to help keep petrol prices lower for motorists.

He also said that the Government understood the important of continued investment in the North Sea and will work with the industry on the case for introducing a new category of field that qualifies for field allowance. Field allowances already exist to provide concessions to the supplementary charge on profits from qualifying small or technically challenging new fields. North Sea operators already have generous concessions against capital expenditure in recognition of the nature of operations in the UK Continental Shelf.

Moore said that it would be wrong for the Government to stand by and watch as oil company profits spiral and motorists keep paying more and more.

Michael Moore said:

""It is not surprising that oil companies are objecting to paying more tax. The fact is that they are experiencing very high profits because of the very high price of oil. North Sea oil profits are predicted to be £24 billion before tax in the coming year. It is the right and fair thing to do to take £2 billion of that money to help keep prices lower for motorists.

""Families and businesses are struggling, and it's right to ease their pain by asking the oil companies to pay a bit more of their unexpected billions in additional profits. That is the choice that we have made and I think that families and businesses across Scotland will understand that it is the right one.

""This is not a one way bet. If the oil price comes back down then the tax comes down. We will also be working with the industry on new categories of field allowance in order to support investment. The Treasury have said that they do not expect to see a significant impact on investment or production.

""The Government did not randomly pick out the oil and gas sector for more tax.  There is a connection between the spiralling price of oil, the high profits of oil companies and motorists having to pay more and more at the pump. It would have been wrong for the Government to simply stand by and watch. Average post tax profits per barrel are still predicted to be higher over the next 5 years than over the previous 5 years.

""We understand that the oil companies don't like more tax - no-one does - but given that they were planning more North Sea investment when their profits were much lower, we do not believe that it will be necessary for them to axe a lot of jobs when their profits are much higher.""

"Every department in Whitehall  has nominated a minister responsible for ensuring devolution issues are taken into account when the UK Government makes decisions.

The Secretary of State for Scotland wrote to the First Minister to inform him of the new devolution ministers network which will meet regularly under the chairmanship of the Deputy Prime Minister.

Its members will work closely with the Secretaries of State for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

Speaking at the SCDI Annual Forum in St Andrews, the Scottish Secretary Michael Moore said the country's two governments had to work closely together and that embedding the culture of devolution throughout the UK's civil service structure would make for a better working relationship between Holyrood and Westminster.

The coalition government made a clear commitment to a mutual respect agenda and the Scotland Office, other UK departments and their Ministers have actively engaged with their counterparts in Edinburgh.

The Minister said:

""We have made great progress in the relationship between the two governments in Scotland since coming to power. Our approach of mutual respect is the only basis for good working relations between Westminster and the devolved administrations.

""While we have ensured, there are good lines of communication and consistent cross-border cooperation but we cannot be complacent.

""I strongly support the new approach as devolution is fundamental to this government's values and embedded in our national life.

""Whatever the outcome of this May's election, the UK government will seek to engage actively and constructively with the next Scottish Government.

""The new network of Devolution Ministers is a further indication of our commitment to that approach.""

"Cutting the cost of petrol at the pump by taking more money from the unexpectedly large profits of oil companies  is ""fundamentally fair"" said Scottish Secretary Michael Moore today.

The UK Government has decided to finance a reduction in petrol prices at the pump by taking £2bn from the profits of oil companies.

Fuel duty will be cut by 1p per litre from 6pm tonight and next month's planned increase of almost 5p has been scrapped.

Michael Moore said the Budget, which is fiscally neutral, ""targets help at those Scottish households that need it most"".

Among the measures announced today by the Chancellor which will help Scottish households are:

- Cutting the cost of fuel duty by 1p per litre and scrapping the planned 5p increase.  
- A further increase in personal allowances in 2012 that will cut income tax for 2.2m Scots and remove a further 21,000 Scots from income tax altogether. 71,000 will be removed by the personal allowance change already scheduled for this April, meaning a total of 92,000 Scots taken out of income tax by April 2012  
- Delaying the planned increase in Air Passenger Duty.

The Scottish Secretary also said that this budget will also create the conditions for ""growth, jobs and a strong, rebalanced economy"".

Measures that will help Scotland's economic growth include:

- Doubling this April's planned corporation tax cut from 1p to 2p.  This will be followed by annual 1p reductions until 2014 giving us the lowest corporation tax in the G20 at 23p.  
- £113m of extra resources for the Scottish Government over the next 5 years: £70m of that will come in 2011-12.  
- Bringing forward the operational date of the Green Investment Bank so that it is lending to green projects by 2012 and increasing its resources to £3bn. This will mean hundreds of millions of pounds of potential investment in Scottish renewable projects.  
- Start-up and micro businesses will be exempt from new domestic regulation for three years from this April  
- The Scottish Government will be allowed to carry forward £130m of underspend from this financial year into next.

Speaking after the Budget statement, Scottish Secretary Michael Moore said:

""This Budget is about helping those Scottish households that need it most. That is what fairness is all about. These are tight times and we cannot go on a spending spree so it is crucial that we target our help correctly.

""It is fair to cut the spiralling cost of petrol by taking a bit more from the fast rising profits of the oil and gas sector.  Many of Scotland¿s families and communities rely on affordable prices at the pump, and we are right to take action.

""It is also fair to take another 21,000 low paid Scots out of income tax altogether next year by raising personal allowances - and to cut the income tax bill of 2.2 million low and middle income Scots.

""And it is also fair to give Scotland a competitive edge in industry and job creations.  This Budget does that by cutting corporation tax and putting us on a fast track to have the lowest rate in the entire G20 by 2014. This will help companies throughout Scotland.""

"The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore has welcomed news that three sites in Scotland have been shortlisted for UNESCO World Heritage status. Eleven sites across the UK have been nominated by the coalition government, after being recommended by an independent panel, with the results expected in 2012.

The Forth Rail Bridge and Mousa, Old Scatness and Jarlshof in Shetland as well as the Flow Country of Caithness and Sutherland have been named as contenders for Unesco recognition.

The Secretary of State said:

 ""These sites are fine examples of the cultural and natural heritage that Scotland offers; from the magnificent peatlands in northern Scotland to the feat of engineering of the Forth Rail Bridge in central Scotland. Scotland already boasts fives world heritage sites and these would make fantastic additions. I look forward to the decision next year that should bring more tourists to these sites, bringing money into the local economy.""

These sites are aiming to join Scotland¿s existing world heritage sites; New Lanark, St. Kilda, Heart of Neolithic Orkney, Edinburgh's Old and New Towns, and the Antonine Wall (as part of the Frontier of the Roman Empire.) There are currently twenty four sites across the UK.

"Bogus students and colleges in Scotland will face a major clampdown by the UK Government under plans unveiled by the Home Office today (Tuesday 22 March)

However, Scotland's universities and public colleges in Scotland will be protected as they are Highly Trusted Sponsors - the proposals are designed to weed out non-accredited private colleges abusing the immigration system.

The Secretary of State has worked closely with the Home Secretary to tailor the way the  changes affect Scotland, including protecting graduates in Scotland with good business ideas which can contribute to the economy. As a result, the UK Government also pledged today to develop a new entrepreneur route for bright and innovative students who have a business idea and want to make it work in Britain.

The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore said:

""These proposals are not designed to harm Scotland or its contact with international students but instead make life harder for the least trustworthy institutions. Scottish universities and public colleges will continue to be trusted sponsors and I am also glad we helped secure the new route for entrepreneurial students wishing to set up a business after graduating.

""We all realise the contribution that innovative, bona fide students make to Scotland but it is important to tighten up a system which has been abused in the past. The measures announced do that in a way which recognises the economic value of our education system here in Scotland.""

Standards and checks for students seeking visas will be significantly raised, dealing with a long-running issue in Scotland.

From April 2012, all institutions wanting to sponsor students will have to be classed as Highly Trusted Sponsors and become accredited by statutory education inspection bodies by the end of 2012. The current system does not currently require this.

Bogus colleges and students will also face further strong new tests including potential students having to speak English to a higher standard, show they can support themselves financially without taking paid employment, and show they are coming to the UK for the purposes of studying rather than working.

The labour market statistics also show employment in Scotland has increased by 8,000 over the three months to November 2010 - January 2011. The number of those in employment in Scotland now stands at 2,480,000.

"The Scottish Parliament's overwhelming vote in support of the Scotland Bill marks a huge step forward for the future of devolution, the Secretary of State for Scotland said tonight (Thursday 10 March).

MSPs voted 121 to 3 with one abstension in favour of the Legislative Consent Motion for the Scotland Bill, which means the Bill will now continue its way through the House of Commons and House of Lords for the next legislative stages.

The Bill will deliver the largest transfer of fiscal powers from London since the creation of the UK. It will increase the powers and financial accountability of the Scottish Parliament through setting an annual rate of Scottish income tax.

Speaking in Edinburgh, Michael Moore said:

""The vote at Holyrood is a resounding endorsement of the positive changes in the Scotland Bill. The UK and Scottish Parliaments are both now backing our plans to improve devolution.

""It will bring responsibility in spending and further powers which will benefit the Scottish people. The Scottish Parliament has tested this Bill thoroughly, first through Committee and now through a vote among MSPs.

""The Bill has majority support and I am glad to see even those who opposed the process from the beginning have seen the benefit of this legislation and recommended it is now taken forward in Westminster.

""This builds on the vote of the Scottish people in the referendum of 1997 when they voted for powers and the ability to raise taxes. The Bill will build on both of those areas and the great success of devolution over the past decade.""

The Secretary of State has previously made clear such a significant change could only take place with the agreement of Holyrood. The vote follows Holyrood's  Scotland Bill Committee Report which endorsed the majority of the Bill's clauses and made a number of further recommendations. These are now being considered in detail by the UK Government.

If supported in the UK Parliament, the Scotland Bill will mean that:

  * MSPs at Holyrood will have to set a Scottish rate of income tax each year and will be responsible for raising a much greater proportion of the revenue they spend.
  * The Scottish Parliament with get additional borrowing powers
  * The Scottish Parliament will have responsibility for stamp duty, landfill tax and the ability to propose new taxes.
  * A Scottish Cash Reserve will be created to bank and save money where tax receipts exceed those expected.
  * Policy responsibility in areas such as air weapons, drink drive limit and setting the national speed limit will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament and Scottish Government.
  * The Scotland Bill will be discussed in Committee in the House of Commons on Monday 14 and Tuesday 15 March, and will be followed by Report and Third Reading before moving to the House of Lords.

The Scotland Bill Committee recommended a further Consent Motion towards the end of consideration of the Bill at Westminster, focused on amendments made to the Bill.

The Secretary of State has written to the Committee to say he believes this to be a sensible proposal which will enable the Scottish Parliament to consider the totality of amendments.

"The Advocate General, Lord Wallace QC, has agreed with the recommendation of the Scottish Parliament's Scotland Bill Committee to conduct further work on the proposals to remove the prosecution actions of the Lord Advocate from the devolution issues procedure under the Scotland Act.  
   
Lord Wallace welcomed the Committee's support in principle for the changes and is now seeking views on the draft clauses which have already been discussed with the Scottish Government and Holyrood's Scotland Bill Committee. The aim is to have an amendment that can be tabled during the House of Lords stages of the Scotland Bill later this year.   
   
The current proposals from the Advocate General accept the recommendations of the independent Expert Group that was established to look into this matter.   
   
The policy position of the Advocate General as set out in the draft clauses would mean that:   
 

  * Acts of the Lord Advocate in relation to a prosecution would be removed from the devolution issues procedure under the Scotland Act.
  * Scots would retain a right of appeal to the UK Supreme Court in relation to ECHR and EU obligations that arise in criminal cases.
  * Section 102 of the Scotland Act is amended to provide a court with a discretion to limit the retrospective effect of its judgments in a case where it determines that acts of the Scottish Ministers are outwith the powers conferred by the Scotland Act.

   
The problem that has arisen since devolution is that because the Lord Advocate is ""a Scottish Minister"" under the Scotland Act 1998, all her actions, including her prosecution actions, must be compatible with ECHR. If the Lord Advocate is ruled to have acted in contravention of the Scotland Act, as in the recent Cadder case, then the consequences for the criminal justice system in Scotland can be severe and disruptive.   
   
Lord Wallace said:  
   
""This problem was first raised by the Scottish judges to the Calman Commission and there is general consensus that the prosecution actions of the Lord Advocate should not be covered by the Scotland Act. I don't want to see the situation where a legal ruling on a single case can have a sweeping and disruptive effect on our entire criminal justice system. The Scotland Bill currently going through the UK Parliament provides us with the opportunity to address this problem.  
   
""It is true that there is disagreement about other aspects of this issue, in particular the respective roles of the High Court in Edinburgh and Supreme Court in London. I am pleased that the Scottish Parliament Committee on the Scotland Bill supported our plan to retain a right of appeal to the UK Supreme Court in certain instances.   
   
""In our dialogue with the Scottish Government on these clauses we have been unable to reach an agreement. I hope that the consultation may help us to find a way forward because it would unfortunate if we were not able to make the most of the opportunity afforded to us by the Scotland Bill presently being considered at Westminster.""  
   
The draft clauses will be put on the website of the Office of the Advocate General today.

"The Secretary of State for Scotland, Michael Moore MP, today marked a major milestone in Rio Tinto Alcan's £45m investment at its plant in Lochaber in the Scottish Highlands. The third of five new generators, built to power the smelter with renewable energy, has been installed.

 During a visit to the plant to review progress with the investment, Michael Moore MP, Secretary of State for Scotland said:

 

""This project, and Rio Tinto Alcan's major investment, is of massive importance to this part of Scotland. The smelter and its jobs are vital to this community. What is equally heartening is to see a global company doing its bit to contribute to developing clean energy, green jobs and of course to helping Scotland meet its renewable energy targets.""

 

The new modern hydroelectric generators have the capacity to generate the plant¿s required electricity supply, as well as the potential to generate additional power. As a result of the increased power generation, it is expected that aluminium production at Lochaber could increase from 43,000 tonnes per year to 50,000 tonnes per year.

 

The Rio Tinto Alcan plant in Lochaber contributes over £8 million a year to the Highlands economy and employs 170 people, making it one of the Highlands' largest private sector employers. It also helps underpin an additional 400 jobs through indirect employment and supply chain opportunities. This repowering project will offer much needed long-term job security in the region.

 

The new generators will replace the existing hydro generators at the Lochaber plant which have been in use since their installation in 1929. The £45 million modernisation project, which began in 2009, will be completed by 2012.

"Rail passengers will have a faster journey and will not have to change at Scottish stations for onward journeys to Aberdeen and Inverness as the result of a UK Government announcement on the future of railways today (Tuesday 1 March).

The decision to purchase bi-mode trains - which can run on both electrified lines and using diesel - and resume the Intercity Express Programme was announced by the Transport Secretary in the House of Commons.

A new generation of intercity 125 trains will replace the existing rolling stock and mean journeys to the north of Scotland will not require passengers to swap platforms to change between separate electric and diesel trains to complete their journeys.

The UK Government announced it was taking forward discussions with the preferred bidder Agility Trains with a view to placing a contract for the Intercity Express Programme by the end of 2011.

Any move to purchase the 500 units of rolling stock will have to pass stringent value for money test and compliance with EU obligations. The rail industry will also be consulted on plans for implementing the new stock.

The Intercity Express Programme was launched by the previous administration but later placed on hold as a review of procurement was ordered.

The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore said:

""This is good news for the UK and has a particular significance for Scotland and its railways. The coalition government is making a multi-billion investment in the future of rail by upgrading its rolling stock. It will allow better and faster services as well as continuing through-journeys between London and parts of the rail network which are not electrified. That means journeys in Scotland will remain simple and convenient.

"The Secretary of State for Scotland met Business Secretary Vince Cable in London today (5 April 2011) to discuss the possibility of bringing the Green Investment Bank (GIB) to Scotland.  
   
The latest meeting between the ministers follows the launch of the Edinburgh bid at Westminster last week when a cross-sector group presented the business case for the Scottish capital at an event in Westminster.   
   
The Scottish Secretary was presented with a document detailing the arguments for Edinburgh and said he would make sure it was given serious and careful consideration by the UK Government.  
   
BIS officials are examining the proposals submitted by The Edinburgh Green Investment Bank Group to base the GIB in Edinburgh.  The department is also talking to the Edinburgh financial community as part of the process of designing the bank.    
   
The meeting with the Business Secretary is the latest in a series of meetings Michael Moore has held with fellow Cabinet ministers, the energy industry and other relevant sectors on making the case for Scotland to host the GIB.   
   
The recent Budget announced that the Green Investment Bank fund would grow from £1 billion to £3 billion.   
   
Speaking after the meeting, Michael Moore said:   
   
""I have always made a strong case for the Green Investment Bank coming to Scotland and will continue to do so within government and elsewhere. My latest meeting with the Business Secretary to discuss was very constructive. No decision has been made on the location yet and I welcome the fact that the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills will be speaking directly to the financial sector in Edinburgh on the issue in the near future.""

"Scots will benefit from the biggest shake up of the state pension system for decades, the Secretary of State for Scotland said today.

The UK Government today unveiled a Green Paper A state pension for the 21st century which laid out options on simplifying the tax system and making it fairer for future pensioners.

They include a single-tier state pension, currently estimated at around £140 a week and lifting people out of mean-testing and Pension Credit. The Government's argument is that this will  provide better support for saving in retirement as well as underpin the existing plans to automatically enrol people into workplace pensions from 2012, bringing 5-8 million into saving for the first time.

Michael Moore said:

""The reform of the state pension system is long overdue and the options laid out by government today will help end the inequalities of the current arrangement which penalises women, low earners and the self-employed in Scotland. Many people are confused by the state pension system and any move to make it easier to understand and rewarding for those who deserve it is to be welcomed.""

"Scotland's capital is in the frame to become the base for the UK Government's Green Investment Bank (GIB).

Proposals have been put forward which make the separate cases to locate the headquarter in London, Edinburgh and Bristol, among other cities. A decision will be taken in due course based on the ability to deliver.

A  progress report outlining the phased approach leading up to the GIB was unveiled at Westminster today (Tuesday 24 May) by the Business Secretary Vince Cable.

As the Chancellor set out in Budget 2011, the initial capitalisation of the GIB will be £3 billion and the bank will invest with and through the private sector and tackle risks which the private sector cannot adequately finance.

The bank would mobilise projects significantly in excess of the Government's contribution. With the funding provided in this Parliament, the GIB could mobilise an extra £15bn of private investment. 

The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore said: ""I have been making Edinburgh¿s case within government as strongly and often as possible and I am convinced that the city's strategic location and financial expertise make it an ideal place to locate the Bank.

""Scotland's capital has all the elements needed to create a successful and thriving Green Investment Bank - access to finance, markets and funding and the expertise of the renewables industry across Scotland.

""There is some way to go but I will continue to press home those advantages until the final decision is made. I will continue to work alongside others to bring the Green Investment Bank north.""

The Secretary of State for Scotland met Business Secretary Vince Cable in April  to discuss the possibility of bringing the Green Investment Bank (GIB) to Scotland and has met other Cabinet ministers on the issue.

"A new independent body to monitor unfair practices by retailers could help protect Scottish suppliers from having unnecessary risks or excessive costs passed on to them, according to the Secretary of State for Scotland.

The UK Government's Consumer Minister Edward Davey published the draft Groceries Code Adjudicator Bill and invited pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill by Parliament at Westminster today (Tuesday 24 May)

 

The Bill is looking to establish a Groceries Code Adjudicator which would be responsible for monitoring and enforcing the Groceries Supply Code of Practice (GSCOP). That code has been in place since February 2010 and is currently monitored by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT).

 

The new adjudicator would be able to act as an arbitrator in disputes between retailers and their direct suppliers and investigate breaches of the Code based on complaints from suppliers and/or information in the public domain.

 

In August 2010, the UK Government published its response to the consultation to take forward the establishment of a body to monitor and enforce the Groceries Supply Code of Practice (GSCOP). This draft Bill is the result of this consultation and the Competition Commission's Market Investigation on the Supply of Groceries in the UK.

 

Scottish Secretary Michael Moore said: ""It is in everyone's interest for suppliers and retailers in Scotland have a close, fair and productive working relationship. That is good for business and good for consumers.

 

""These are early days but the principle of ensuring a fair and balanced relationship between suppliers and retailers is one I strongly support. Creating an independent body like this would give Scottish companies which supply to grocery retailers security and access to dispute resolution. Those firms now have a chance to make their opinions heard as the Bill goes through Parliament and I hope they will do so.""

 

The UK Government Consumer Minister Edward Davey said:

 

""Preventing unfair practices and increasing certainty for suppliers will safeguard consumer interests, as large retailers won't be able to take advantage of their position of power, as set out in the Code.

 

""This is an important step towards establishing the Groceries Code Adjudicator, to which the Government is strongly committed .""

Scotland's two governments and the country's employment organisations must work together to fight youth unemployment, the Secretary of State for Scotland said today.

Speaking at a seminar in North Ayrshire with the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Iain Duncan Smith, Michael Moore said Scotland could not afford the cost of leaving young people out of the job market and called for work across ""political, organisational and geographical boundaries"" to tackle the issue.

The event was the first in a series of three regional seminars on youth unemployment across Scotland.

It brought together national and local politicians and over 40 stakeholders, including JobCentre Plus and employability organisations.

The seminars will look at practical ways policymakers and those working on the frontline can make a difference to youth in Scotland and their chances in the job market.

Professor David Bell of the University of Stirling and local MP Brian Donohoe also spoke at the seminar.

Youth unemployment in Scotland was 17.6% in the first quarter of 2011, an increase of 3.6%.

The rate has risen faster in Scotland than across the UK as a whole, while North Ayrshire has the highest rate of youth unemployment in Scotland.

Michael Moore said: ""The welfare reforms the coalition government is making will provide dignity for those who need help and opportunity for those who can work.

""For too long welfare has treated individuals as statistics: that must change. Every individual should have chances and opportunities in life and the benefits system must make that possible.

""That's why we¿'e creating pathways back to work for those who feel cut off from the workplace and using new and innovative methods to do that.

""We have to make sure that work pays.¿¿ By doing so, we are building the skills and confidence people need to get a foot on to the jobs ladder.

""This is about giving young Scots the fair chance they need.""

The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Iain Duncan Smith said:

""The previous government abandoned work support for 16 and 17 year olds. As a result we saw employment rates for this group plummet, and we now have a lost generation of young Scots with insufficient skills, training, confidence and work experience.

""If we lose young people early we risk losing them for good as they fall into a lifetime of dependency and despondency.

""That's why we are starting to re-establish the crucial link between young benefit claimants and the Jobcentre support system, and introducing extended work experience placements, apprenticeships and the Innovation Fund to support social investment for the most disadvantaged young people.""

"Unemployment in Scotland fell by 8,000, to 208,000 in the period January to March 2011, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) data released today. The Scottish unemployment rate is 7.7 per cent, the same as the UK average.

The labour market statistics also show employment in Scotland has fallen by 4,000 over the three months to January - March 2011. The number of those in employment in Scotland now stands at 2,482,000.

The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore said:

""A significant drop in Scottish unemployment during the first quarter of 2011 is undoubtedly good news. Every person who leaves unemployment and gets into work is a step in the right direction.

""The UK Government knows it cannot be complacent on this issue and that is why we are putting our efforts continuing to create the conditions for growth.

""There has been a lot of change in Scottish politics in recent weeks but no one at either Westminster or Holyrood should forget our main and immediate priority is the economy. It is business as usual when it comes to getting Scotland back into work.

""I will also host a seminar on youth unemployment in Irvine tomorrow, alongside Iain Duncan Smith and Brian Donohoe MP. We are bringing together local and national partners to discuss how we can tackle youth unemployment in challenging economic circumstances and I look forward to working in collaboration with organisations across Scotland.""

Employment

 

The Labour Force Survey (LFS) indicates that the number of people in employment in Scotland from January to March 2011 was 2,482,000. Employment was down by 4,000 compared to the previous three months, and up by 46,000 compared to the same period last year. The employment rate increased by 0.1 per cent over the quarter, and increased 1.2 per cent over the year, to 71.2 per cent. In comparison, the Scottish employment rate is above the UK average.

 

Unemployment in Scotland was down 8,000 over the quarter January to March 2011, to 208,000. The level was down 10,000 compared to the same quarter last year. The unemployment rate was down 0.3 p.p. from the previous quarter to 7.7 per cent, which is down 0.5 p.p. over the year.

 

The claimant count in Scotland, based on the seasonally adjusted number of people claiming Job Seeker's Allowance (JSA), increased by 200 from March, to 137,400 in April 2011. The level is up by 2,400 on April 2010. The claimant count rate is unchanged over the month at 5.1 per cent, and up by 0.1 p.p. over the year. Note, that claimant count figures for the last month have been revised.

 

The number of economically active (defined as those in employment or ILO unemployed, and seasonally adjusted) in Scotland in the January to March 2011 quarter was 2,690,000. This was down 12,000 on the previous quarter, and up 36,000 on the same point a year ago. Among those aged 16-64 the economic activity rate was 77.3 per cent, down 0.1 p.p. on the previous quarter, and up 0.9 p.p. over the year.

 

1. The internationally comparable International Labour Organisation (ILO) measure of unemployment is the headline figure published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) for UK regions/countries.

2. The ILO measure of unemployment, which is derived from the Labour Force Survey (LFS), is published 12 times a year for an average of three consecutive months, so the May publication will show the average for January - March. ONS recommend that seasonally adjusted data should be compared with the previous non-overlapping three-month period: i.e. January ¿ March data should be compared with October - December data. Quarter to quarter changes at country/regional level are especially subject to sampling variability and should be interpreted in the context of changes over several quarters.

3. The count of those claiming unemployment-related benefits continues to provide a full and timely range of data at sub-Scotland level for local authorities, Travel to Work Areas (TTWAs) and parliamentary constituencies. The claimant count is also the main source of information on unemployment by age and duration. Data on the claimant count in the New Deal age and duration groups is available from 1985.

4. The ILO measure of unemployment defines unemployed people as those who are; without a job, want a job, have actively sought work in the last four weeks and are available to start work in the next two weeks or; out of work, have a found a job and are waiting to start in the next two weeks. The claimant count measures the number of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance benefits. The claimant count measure is always the lower measure because some unemployed people are not entitled to claim benefits, or choose not to do so.

5. Economic activity is a measure of those who are in employment plus those who are unemployed but are available to enter the labour market (ILO unemployed). Conversely, the economically inactive are those people who are not in employment, but do not fulfill all the ILO criteria to be classified as unemployed. The most common reasons given for inactivity are being a student, being retired, looking after a family or home and being long-term sick or disabled.

The Secretary of State for Scotland, Michael Moore, said the UK Government's plans to improve its global embassy network is good news for Scottish companies.

The Foreign Secretary, William Hague, today revealed plans today that will place more emphasis on emerging economic markets. More diplomats will be posted to India and China increasing the UK influence in the worlds fastest growing economies.

The UK currently has 140 embassies around the world and plans to add up to five more in the next few years. These include El Salvador, Kyrgyzstan and Southern Sudan which becomes independent in July.

Michael Moore said:

""The coalition government is committed to increasing overseas trade that is especially important during these hard economic times. The UK has always had a strong presence around the world and this strategic shift will ensure we are in the right regions at the right time. This is good news for Scottish companies exploring overseas markets.""

"Consumers in India now receive better protection from fake ""Scotch Whisky"" following a decision formally to recognise Scotch Whisky as a product that can only be made in Scotland.

Authorities in India have granted an application by the Scotch Whisky Association for Scotch Whisky to be registered and protected as a ""geographical indication of origin"" (GI). The breakthrough was marked today in Edinburgh by the India Consul General Anil Anand,  
Scotland Office Minister David Mundell and Scotch Whisky Association Chief Executive Gavin Hewitt.

GI registration supports the integrity of Scotch Whisky as a product made in Scotland according to the Scotch Whisky Regulations 2009.  
 

David Mundell, Scotland Office Minister, said:

""The UK Government has been working hard to protect Scotch Whisky and the consumer from the passing-off of inferior products. The awarding of Geographical Indication status in India is good news for Scotland and great news for one of its most important exports. India is the latest market to benefit from GI protection and we will continue to work with the SWA tosupport this essential Scottish industry.""  
 

Gavin Hewitt, Chief Executive of the Scotch Whisky Association, said:

""India is one of our priority markets. There is a huge demand for Scotch Whisky from discerning Indian consumers. It is important that they have confidence in the quality and integrity of what they are buying.  
 

""We plan to celebrate the granting of the GI registration later this year in New Delhi where we will take the opportunity to promote Scotch Whisky in that important market.""

India is a top ten export market by volume for Scotch Whisky and its significance is growing.

Last year 40.1 million 70cl bottles of Scotch Whisky were exported to India, an increase of 40% on 2009.

The European Commission should recognise the specific needs of Scottish farming and not set upper limits on direct payments for large farms, the Secretary of State for Scotland said today (Thursday 23 June).

Speaking during a visit to the Royal Highland Show in Edinburgh, Michael Moore also raised his concern over the suggestion the EC rural development budget could be cut disproportionately..

Moore said he feared such changes would have a significant effect on Scotland as it has some of the largest farms but one of the smallest rural development budgets in Europe.

He also said the a joint statement signed by the Secretary of State Caroline Spelman in February had made it clear any capping of direct payments on the basis of farm size would be against the principles of Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) reform, particularly in terms of competitiveness and making CAP more equitable.

He said:

""The Highland Show is a great annual opportunity to show off the very best of Scottish farming and agriculture. It underlines the fact we need to be vigilant and active when it comes to getting the best for Scotland from Europe and CAP.

""One of my current concerns is the prospect of cuts in the rural development budget. If this turns out to be the case, it would be punishing for Scotland which already has a relatively modest budget compared to other countries. It could put agri-environmental schemes at risk and call into question the size of Less Favoured Area payments in the future.

""Another concern is the threat of a reduction of direct payments to farms because of their size.  We support competitiveness and incentives to help farmers become more sustainable. The threat of a reduction on the grounds of a farm's size would be damaging to that element of CAP reform and see the creation of a two-tier treatment of farmers within the single market.

""We need to keep making these points ahead of the publication of the Commission's detailed legislative proposals on CAP reform and fight for a fairer distribution of direct payments for Scottish agriculture.""

The Minister toured the Royal Highland Show and met with the National Farmers Union Scotland earlier today.

"Provisional figures from HMRC show that if the Scottish Government were to cut Corporation Tax to the same level as Ireland there could be a gap of more than £2.6bn in the Scottish Budget.  David Gauke, the Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury announced these provisional figures to the House of Commons during the Report Stage of the Scotland Bill on Tuesday 21 June.

Scottish Secretary Michael Moore also quoted these figures as he addressed Scottish Financial Enterprise in Edinburgh and called on business to ""be part of a better, more mature debate on Scotland's economic and constitutional future"".

The Scottish Government wants to devolve and cut corporation tax. The UK Government remains opposed to the idea but has agreed to  consider a further submission from the Scottish Government. Devolving Corporation Tax was previously considered and rejected by the independent Calman Commission.

Michael Moore said:

""These provisional figures from the HMRC raise some serious questions for the Scottish Government. The possible removal of more than £2.6bn from the Scottish Budget is a big drop and would require some tough choices to be made.  Would they make the necessary budget cuts or would they look to raise the money from other sources such as Scottish Income tax? We could be faced with the scenario of Scottish families paying hundreds of pounds more each year in order to plug the gap.

""Let me be clear. I am not denying the right of the Scottish Government and the Scottish people to debate these issues. But what I do take issue with is the way in which that debate is being conducted. And that is for two main reasons. The first is that it is having the effect of distracting our focus in Scotland from what should be our top priority - rebuilding our economy. The constitutional debate cannot be at the expense of our immediate focus on creating the environment in which Scottish businesses can prosper.

""And the second reason is that the current debate is simply too heavily founded in rhetoric, and not enough in hard facts. The Prime Minister has made clear that he will make the positive, optimistic case for Scotland's place in the United Kingdom. As a proud Scot, I am happy to join him in making that case.  I am absolutely clear that Scotland's interests, and Scotland's future, are best protected by a devolved Scottish Government working within the framework of the United Kingdom.

""The UK Government will happily put forward further evidence in support of the case for Scotland remaining part of the United Kingdom as and when the opportunity arises. But this is not just a debate for politicians. It must involve Scots from all walks of life. So today, I invite you to be part of a better, more mature debate on Scotland's economic and constitutional future. A debate that is founded on evidence and carefully considered positions. That debate must include your voice - the voice of Scotland's financial services community - and the voice of people from all other walks of life.""

""They illustrate the uncertainty an economy based on oil would experience from year to year. Today's figures show a £9 billion plunge into the red which wipes out the modest surplus of previous years many times over.

""That would have huge consequences for Scotland if it was not able to spread the risk of that volatility as part of a wider UK economy. There is no escaping that fact no matter how creatively the Scottish Government  interprets these figures.

""The year-on-year variations of the oil prices are far better managed in a UK-wide economy. It means Scotland can benefit in the good times and manage its risk effectively when the price drops. As part of the United Kingdom we share in the risks and we share in the recovery.

""It is vital that we get Scotland's economy back on a healthy footing and the UK Government is working hard to achieve that through measures such as cutting corporation tax, reducing the national insurance burden and tackling the deficit.

""Scotland has two governments and they must work together towards the common goal of growth in our economy.""

  
The GERS figures show the estimated current budget balance for the public sector in Scotland was a deficit of:

- £14.9 billion excluding North Sea revenue

- £14.4 billion including a per capita share of North Sea revenue

- £9.0 billion including an illustrative geographical share of North Sea revenue

 In 2009-10, Scotland's estimated net fiscal balance was a deficit of:

-  £19.9 billion excluding North Sea oil revenue

- £19.3 billion including a per capita share of North Sea revenue

- £14 billion including an illustrative geographical share of North Sea revenue

"The Scotland Bill will move a big step closer to becoming law today if it receives the backing of MPs at the Report and Third Reading Stages in the House of Commons.  
   
Scottish Secretary Michael Moore said that the Coalition Government was on track to deliver the changes to devolution that the overwhelming majority of Scots backed at last year's General Election. He said ""the Scotland Bill is the largest ever transfer of financial powers to Scotland and it has an overwhelming mandate from Scottish voters.""  
   
The House of Commons will today consider a number of detailed amendments made to the Bill since the Committee stage in March as well as debating the general principles of the legislation.  
   
If MPs approve the Scotland Bill at 3rd Reading today then the bill will begin the next stage of it's scrutiny in the House of Lords.  
   
Michael Moore said:  
   
""The Scotland Bill is the largest ever transfer of financial powers to Scotland and it has an overwhelming mandate from Scottish voters. All parties put their constitutional options to the test at the General Election and around 80 per cent of Scots supported parties in favour of the Scotland Bill. Those 2 million Scots made their preference very clear.  
   
""By listening to the select committee at Westminster and the Scottish Parliament committee and responding to their recommendations, we have built further consensus around the bill and strengthened the package.  
   
""We have announced new financial powers that will be provided to Holyrood and we will continue to wait for further detailed submissions from the Scottish Government.  
   
""Consensus has been the hallmark of the Scotland Bill. If we maintain the support of the House of Commons for the Bill today then we will be a big step closer to improving devolution and making it more accountable.""  
   
The financial measures set out in the Bill, together with existing devolved powers will provide Scottish Ministers with a total of £12 billion of financial powers and represents the largest single transfer of fiscal power from Westminster in the history of the United Kingdom.

The changes announced to the Bill last week are:

- Introducing a power in the Scotland Bill which will enable the Government to amend, in future, the way in which Scottish Ministers can borrow to include bond issuance, without the need for further primary legislation. The Government will conduct a review of the costs and benefits of bond issuance over other forms of borrowing, and will consider extending Scottish Ministers' powers where this does not undermine the overall UK fiscal position or have a negative impact on total UK borrowing;     

-Removing the requirement for Scottish Ministers to absorb the first £125 million of tax forecasting variation within their budget - this will give the Scottish Government more flexibility to decide how best to respond to variations in tax receipts compared to forecasts;

- Allowing Scottish Ministers to makediscretionary payments into theScottish Cash Reserve for the next five years, up to an overall total of £125 million - this will help manage any variation in Scottish income tax receipts compared to forecasts in the initial phase of the new system; and

- Bringing forward to 2011pre-payments, a form of cash advance, to allow work on the new Forth Replacement Crossing to begin.   
The changes come shortly before the Scotland Bill goes to its Report stage and Third Reading in the House of Commons on 21 June. It will also go to the House of Lords and will be subject to a further vote by the Scottish Parliament.

In making these amendments to the Bill, the UK Government has considered carefully the recommendations made by the Scottish Affairs Committee in the UK Parliament and the Scotland Bill Committee in the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish Government has indicated it has further proposals to make in a number of areas. Some of these have already been considered and rejected as part of the Calman process on the basis of a careful consideration of the evidence.

Nevertheless, the UK Government has committed to listen carefully to any detailed proposals supported by robust evidence that are put forward by the Scottish Government.However, the amendments to the Bill and supporting package announced today will ensure that Scottish Ministers have greater flexibility to exercise their new powers effectively, with greater accountability to the Scottish people.

"Unemployment in Scotland fell by 10,000, to 207,000 in the period February to April 2011, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) data released today. The Scottish unemployment rate is 7.7 per cent, the same as the UK average. 

The labour market statistics also show employment in Scotland has fallen by 7,000 over the three months to February - April 2011. The number of those in employment in Scotland now stands at 2,473,000.

 

The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore said:

 

""The fall in unemployment over the three months to April is welcome news but we recognise these are challenging times for the Scottish labour market. The increase in people claiming Jobseekers Allowance is clearly disappointing.

 

""Building on the radical programme of reforms set out in the first Plan for Growth, the Government last week launched the next stage of the Growth Review with one central purpose: creating the right conditions for business to start up, invest, grow and create jobs.

 

""The UK Government invited the Scottish Government, the country's employment organisations and other stakeholders to work together for a stronger Scottish labour market. This is why we held a seminar in North Ayrshire to look at practical solutions to fight youth unemployment and will follow this up with two more events in Scotland.""

"The Scotland Bill will preserve the role of the Supreme Court  in relation to human rights matters while recognising the role of the Lord Advocate as head of criminal prosecutions in Scotland by removing his acts from ""devolution issue"", the Advocate General said today (Tuesday 14 June).

A Written Ministerial Statement laid in Westminster yesterday outlined the intention to implement the findings of the Expert Group which looked at devolution issues concerning the Lord Advocate as head of the system of criminal prosecution in Scotland.  
   
An amendment tabled to the Scotland Bill will :  
   
-     remove acts of the Lord Advocate in his capacity as head of criminal prosecutions in Scotland that are incompatible with any rights conferred by the European Convention on Human Rights or Community law from the category of  ""devolution issues"" for which special court procedure is provided for in the Scotland Act;   
-     Create a statutory right of appeal from the High Court of Justiciary to the Supreme Court in relation to matters where it is alleged that the Lord Advocate has acted incompatibly with any such Convention right or Community law.  
   
In September 2010, the Advocate General launched a consultation and established an Expert Group to report on the effect of the Scotland Act on the role of the Lord Advocate.

He concluded that implementation of the report's recommendations represented a positive and sensible reform of the current position in the light of the experience of devolution issues over the last decade.  
   
It will continue to be unlawful for the Lord Advocate to act incompatibly with a Convention right or with Community law. This amendment will not relieve the Lord Advocate from his obligations to comply with Convention rights or with Community law when acting in his capacity as head of criminal prosecutions and investigation of deaths in Scotland.  
   
It also preserves the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, but only in relation to questions relating to Convention rights and Community law. All other aspects of criminal law and procedure will be finally determined by the High Court of Justiciary.   
   
The unique position of the Lord Advocate among Scottish Ministers as being both a Scottish Minister and an independent head of the system of criminal prosecutions and investigation of deaths in Scotland will continue to be recognised.  
   
The Advocate General the Lord Wallace of Tankerness QC said:  
   
""The Expert Group which I established highlighted the anomaly that the Lord Advocate could be subject to so-called 'devolution issues' when carrying out retained pre-devolution functions.  
   
""The amendment will remove that anomaly.  
   
""However, the Expert Group also recommended that Scots should still retain a right of appeal to the Supreme Court where it is claimed the prosecution has acted incompatibly with ECHR rights or EU law.""

"Scotland is set for extra financial powers as part of the Scotland Bill, the UK Government announced today (Monday 13 June).

A joint Written Ministerial Statement by the Treasury and Scotland Office laid in Westminster builds on the cross-party consensus around the Bill by revealing a package of powers for the Scottish Parliament in addition to the existing changes outlined in the Scotland Bill. The new powers give the Scottish Government greater responsibility for the taxes required to fund their spending decisions and will improve the accountability of the Scottish Government to the Scottish people.

The financial measures set out in the Bill, together with existing devolved powers will provide Scottish Ministers with a total of £12 billion of financial powers and represents the largest single transfer of fiscal power from Westminster in the history of the United Kingdom.

However, the amendments to the Bill and supporting package announced today will ensure that Scottish Ministers have greater flexibility to exercise their new powers effectively, with greater accountability to the Scottish people.   
   
The Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne said: ""The Scotland Bill represents a major devolution of responsibility to the Scottish people for raising taxes. It is proof that this Government is delivering on the promises we made to the Scottish people. I always said that if ideas were put forward by the Scottish Parliament to improve the way the new fiscal powers will work, I would listen carefully and treat them with respect.  
   
So today, I am very willing to offer these important changes. They will give the Scottish Parliament and Scottish Government much greater flexibility in the use of their new tax and borrowing powers. They are also fair to the people of the rest of the United Kingdom, who have an interest in sound public finances.     
   
I have always believed that devolution brings rights, but also responsibilities. The far reaching changes we are introducing means that the Scottish people and their elected representatives will be much more responsible not just for decisions on public spending in Scotland, but also for the Scottish taxes needed to pay for those decisions.  
   
I think this will significantly improve the fiscal responsibility and accountability of the Scottish Government, which can only be good for the people of Scotland.""  
   
The Secretary of State Michael Moore said: ""The Scotland Bill is already the biggest transfer of fiscal power from London since the creation of the UK.  
   
""By listening to the Scottish Parliament committee and responding to its recommendations, we have built further consensus and strengthened the package.  
   
""We are introducing a mechanism to protect the Scottish budget from sudden shocks. We are also opening up the possibility of future Scottish bonds and bringing forward partial borrowing powers so that work on a new Forth Replacement Crossing can begin in this financial year.  
   
""Along with other measures in the Scotland Bill, these proposals will allow the Scotland to shape the economy we want and generate the jobs we need. They will do so within the framework of strong and stable UK.""

Nearly a month on from their last face to face talks on the Scotland Bill, the Scottish Secretary has said that he hopes the First Minister will use this week's meetings with the UK Government to supply real and substantial detail on its proposed changes it is seeking for the Scotland Bill.

Michael Moore said that the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister and himself were all meeting with Mr Salmond this week and that could only giver proper consideration to serious proposals, properly thought through.

The Prime Minister is chairing the Joint Ministerial Committee in London tomorrow and the Deputy Prime Minister will be in Scotland on Thursday where he will meet the First Minister.

Speaking ahead of the Joint Ministerial Committee at Downing Street, Michael Moore said:

""The UK Government is progressing at a strong pace with its work on the Scotland Bill and the Scottish Government must provide a strong evidence base and detailed plans for the changes it is seeking.  Almost a month has passed since I met with the First Minister in Edinburgh and I would hope that we will get some substantial detail from him this week in the course of the various meetings with UK Ministers.""

In their talks in Edinburgh last month the First Minister agreed to provide the Scottish Secretary with a detailed submission to support the Scottish Government's call for devolving extra borrowing powers, Corporation Tax and the Crown Estate. No submission has been received but the First Minister has since indicated that he also wants to see broadcasting, excise and European Council representation devolved to Holyrood. 

The Prime Minister had a telephone conversation  with Mr Salmond straight after the Scottish elections and both the Chancellor and the Deputy Prime Minister have also met the First Minister in the past few weeks.

"A Scotland Office spokesman said:

 

""The Secretary of State has passed 150 pages of evidence on this issue to the Scottish Government already. The Scotland Office will also provide that material to the members of the new group to assist them.

 

""The responses to the Expert Group set up by the Advocate General showed overwhelming support for the Supreme Court maintaining its important role in devolution issues.

 

""The First Minister clearly wants to see one conclusion in particular. It is one we disagree with and one the previous Expert Group also rejected. 

 

""It is extremely important the new group looks objectively at the issue of justice rather than geography. We have already pointed out it seems odd to prefer to go to Strasbourg with its huge backlog of cases and no Scottish judges when two sit on the Supreme Court.

 

""There has a been a great deal of misinformation about the role of the Supreme Court in recent weeks. The idea that the independence of Scots law is under threat is simply wrong.

 

""The fact remains that only a tiny number of cases go to the Supreme Court every year and the High Court remains Scotland's highest criminal court.

 

""The only way that criminal proceedings reach the Supreme Court from Scotland is where there is a devolution issue, typically where it is alleged that there has been a breach of the European Convention on Human Rights by a Scottish Minister. 

 

""The court only rarely grants permission in devolution issues arising from Scottish criminal proceedings:  it refuses to hear many more appeals in such matters than it decides to allow. Since 2009, the Supreme Court has agreed to hear two cases from Scotland on criminal matters, against around a dozen criminal cases from England and Wales.""

 

""The High Court of Justiciary remains the senior appeal court for criminal cases in Scotland.""

"Scottish Secretary Michael Moore today sent the First Minister more than 150 pages of contributions and conclusions from the UK Government's independent Expert Group which examined the role of the UK Supreme Court in relation to issues of ECHR and EU law arising from criminal prosecutions.

 The Expert Group unanimously agreed that there should be a continuing role for the UK Supreme Court in relation to these issues.

Mr Moore said he hoped this detailed material will assist the deliberations of the new expert group which the First Minister announced earlier this week to examine the same issue. The Scottish Secretary has also sought clarification on the new group's membership, remit, timetable and how it fits into the ongoing Scotland Bill process.

In his letter the Secretary of State says it is clear there is a strong argument for maintaining the role of the Supreme Court to ensure those living in Scotland have the same protections as those in other parts of the United Kingdom. He repeats the UK Government's commitment to look at improving the current arrangements in order to clarify processes and avoid delay.

 Speaking today, Michael Moore said:

""I have written to the First Minister because the detailed, independent work that has been carried out already on this issue will hopefully be of great assistance to the Scottish Government.

""It has been produced by a very respected group of legal minds and it is particularly persuasive that the group reached a unanimous view on the role of the Supreme Court.

""There is a strong argument for retaining the role of the Court in relation to issues of ECHR and EU law arising from criminal prosecutions. People living in Scotland should not have less protection than those in other parts of the UK. I would not be in favour of anything that undermined or distanced those protections for Scotland. I hope that the First Minister and I will be in agreement on this.

""These are issues that need to be examined with care. I have asked the First Minister to help us better understand the composition, remit and plans for his expert group and how this will play into the other work that is ongoing with the Scotland Bill.""

The Minister said:

""As the Secretary of State, I am aware of my role in keeping the Crown Estate focused on its interests and am working to make it more accountable and responsive to Scotland's needs.

""The Crown Estate's significant growth in capital investment despite a fall in the Scottish surplus shows the long-term economic value it creates in Scotland. It's a relevant fact that the Crown Estate currently invests more in Scotland than is raised here, which shows the benefits of having access to a UK-wide portfolio.

""The marine estate's value increased by almost half this year and the UK Government has recently taken action to ensure local communities will benefit directly from marine estate revenues through the Coastal Communities Fund.

""The UK Government is examining the document delivered by the Scottish Government on the issue at present and will respond in due course.""

Scotland's coastal communities are set to receive a multi-million pound annual boost from a new Coastal Communities Fund, the Treasury has announced.

The new fund will be financed by the UK Government through the allocation of funding equivalent to 50 per cent of the revenues from the Crown Estate's marine activities. Beginning in April 2012, the funding  will support the economic development of coastal communities and a wide range of projects. They will include those that support charities, the environment, education and health.

The 2011 funding in Scotland will be worth around £4 million, with £1.85 million earmarked for the Highlands & islands and £2.05 million for the rest of Scotland. It will be available on a bid basis and the UK Government is in discussion with the Big Fund, part of the Big Lottery Fund, on how to deliver for Scotland's communities.

The Secretary of State Michael Moore welcomed the announcement and said:

""This is a wide-ranging and innovative fund which will create many opportunities for coastal communities across Scotland. The Crown Estate has been the subject of much debate in Scotland recently and this is a very positive step to directly linking its marine revenues to the support of projects in Scotland. The fund in Scotland will be worth around £4m in 2012 and I will be working hard to make sure Scottish organisations participate.""

"David Gauke, the Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, has written an article for the _Scotsman _detailing the UK Government's approach to estimating how much it would cost to reduce corporation tax rates in Scotland to 12.5%. This comes after the Secretary of State for Scotland presented an HMRC paper on the subject at his recent appearance before the Scottish Affairs Committee on 13 July.

The article is reproduced below:

There has been a great deal said and written recently, much of it on the pages of this newspaper, about the devolution of corporation tax from Westminster to Holyrood.  And while the Scottish Government has stated its intention to pursue this, it has yet to offer an analysis of the impact such a move would have: what the costs would be, and the economic advantages and disadvantages. 

Clearly this is an important and contentious issue, and one which merits an informed public debate.  As the Treasury Minister with responsibility for the UK's tax system, I am keen to help that happen.  Last week I published a preliminary estimate of the magnitude of the costs Scotland would face were the Scottish Government to reduce corporation tax rate to 12.5%.  These figures, based on early analysis by HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC), show that the costs could be as much as £2.6 billion per year.  I am pleased that this has generated much interest and comment, and is contributing to the debate.  

The UK Government has been clear from the outset that HMRC's analysis was an estimate of the potential costs, and one that is based on certain assumptions.  Of course, it is impossible to estimate costs with 100% accuracy; that is why they are called estimates.  In this context, we must use the best estimates available to inform the debate, and have done so by building on methods used, and previously approved, by the Office for Budget Responsibility for costing UK-wide reductions in corporation tax.  I fully stand by the approach taken in HMRC's analysis.

What is certain is the magnitude of the costs that would be involved - in the order of billions of pounds.  This would be the case regardless of the precise assumptions used and when the devolution of corporation tax might take place.

It has been suggested that  HMRC's analysis is focused on the cost to the Exchequer, rather than to Scotland, and that it does not take account of the benefits to the Scottish economy of a corporation tax cut.  But the costs to the Exchequer _are _the costs to Scotland:  under European law, Scotland would have to bear the costs to the UK of a reduction in corporation tax.  How to cover these costs would, of course, be a decision for the Scottish Government.  This would involve reducing public spending or increasing the rates of other devolved taxes, or a combination of the two.

That is not to say that cutting Corporation Tax - done to the appropriate degree and at the appropriate level - does not bring economic advantages.  The UK Government recognises the benefits of lower corporation tax rates and we have committed to reducing them across the UK to 23% by 2014-15, (which, contrary to some claims, is taken into account in the estimates set out for Scotland.)

But we must be realistic about the costs that will be involved in Scotland. Surely the most important question is: Would the benefits justify the costs?  These benefits need to be measured against the costs. 

To pretend that there are no costs and that cuts in corporation tax will be self-funding is simply wrong.

I believe it is important to have an open discussion on both costs and benefits - that is why we have set out these estimates. 

The Scottish Government is also due to publish a paper setting out its proposals for corporation tax - we will welcome this and will consider it fully.  I hope that it will not only set out plans for minimising cost but will also suggest how this would be funded, and how the potential impact on the rest of the UK would be minimised.  As the UK Government, we need to consider the impact that separate regimes would have on businesses operating in the UK, the efficiency of the tax system and the attractiveness of the UK as a whole to new investors.

As a Government, we recognise the arguments for lower corporation tax rates.  But if the Scottish Government wants to go beyond the reductions for the UK as a whole, there has to be an understanding of the full consequences that the devolution of corporation tax would have, both on the Scottish budget and on the rest of the UK. 

This is why the UK Government has shared its analysis with the Scottish Government.   If we are going to debate the devolution of corporation tax to Scotland, there has to be an acknowledgement that it is a policy that has costs. 

And it is for the advocates of the policy to answer the question: how are they going to pay for it?

The Minister went to Shetland onThursday 21 July where he met a range of businesses and took part in a number of visits.

Along with the local MP and MSP, he met some of the senior management of Total to hear about the Laggan Tormore development and the gas processing plant at Sullom Voe. They also discussed recent taxation changes and energy prices.

Mr Moore then met school pupils at the Shetland Island Council offices and presented the Anderson High winners of the Petrochallenge, a competition based on exploring for petroleum and getting the best return on investment, with their certificates. He then had a discussion with pupils from the Brae school debating team and answered questions on topical issues such as the proposed independence referendum.

A meeting with ZE1 Global - a group of local businesses working together as a company supplying project management, engineering and fabrication services to the global energy industry - saw the Secretary of State chair a lively discussion between the companies and senior managers from Total and Petrofac.

Finally, the Minister attended the opening ceremony of the Tall Ships Race and a reception hosted by Total on the Norwegian ship Christian Radich to celebrate the Laggan Tormore Development.

Moore said:

""A visit to Shetland is always worthwhile and I had productive meetings with local representatives and companies. I hear a number of well-argued points of view which I will share with my colleagues in the UK Government.

""One thing that struck me was the range of activity taking place across the islands, from the major developments taking place in the oil and gas sector to the education of the next generation in the importance of the sector.

""The question and answer session with the Shetland schoolchildren certainly showed there is no shortage of incisive thought and difficult questioning from young Shetlanders.

""Seeing the tall ships in Lerwick was a fantastic experience and showed why Shetland is renowned for its hospitality as is played host to crews from across the world - as well as providing a warm welcome for a UK Government Minister. I hope to be back there before long.""

"Scotland will emerge from the basing review with well over 2,000 more armed forces personnel, more than doubling the Army's presence and retaining a third of the UK's fast jet main operating bases and main naval bases, the Secretary of State for Scotland said today (Monday 18 July).

The defence footprint in Scotland will increase significantly by more than 2,000 posts as a result of decisions made by the UK Government as part of the Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR). This is in addition to 12,300 service personnel already based here, 5,300 civilian jobs in Scotland and thousands of skilled jobs in the defence industry.

It bolsters Scotland's integral role in the defence and security of the United Kingdom, which continues to benefit from what remains one of the largest defence budgets in the world.

A £2 billion programme to rebase the Armed Forces currently in Germany will result in hundreds of millions of pounds worth of investment in infrastructure on bases in Scotland as the Ministry of Defence reconfigures the long-term shape of the defence estate across the UK.

The main changes from the review, announced by the Defence Secretary Liam Fox in Westminster this afternoon, are:

* A sustained and strengthened defence footprint in Moray, with Typhoon squadrons replacing Tornados at RAF Lossiemouth. The phased transition is expected to begin in 2013 and will see up to 2000 RAF and civilian staff based there. We are also planning to place Army units in Kinloss by around 2014/15.

* A changed role for Leuchars, which will become home to a Formation Headquarters and two other major Army units. Troops will form part of a Multi Role Brigade formed by personnel returning from Germany. This will see an increase in numbers at the base, and will see Scotland become home to 20 per cent of the Army's core fighting capability.

* A major development of Kirknewton near Edinburgh into a purpose-built facility to accommodate Army units returning from Germany, with at least 1200 personnel. Other MRB units will be moved into Glencorse, Caledonia, Albemarle Barracks and eventually Arbroath, as over time the bulk of the Royal Marines will be brought together in the South West of England. The Craigiehall site and Redford and Dreghorn Barracks in Edinburgh are set to be vacated by the Army and sold.

* Stirling will continue with its role as headquarters of 51 Brigade and Fort George, home to the Black Watch, is unaffected by the review.

These changes are in addition to other benefits arising from the strong secure defence role for Scotland:

* An increase of 1,200 service personnel at HM Naval Base Clyde, home to the UK's Trafalgar and Astute nuclear submarine fleet, and Scotland's single largest employment site. The combined workforce on the base is currently 6,500 personnel.

* Contracts for the aircraft carriers built at Scotstoun, Govan and Rosyth worth £1.3 billion to the economy, plus £1.25 billion through equipment sub-contracts throughout the UK. Work on the carriers is estimated to provide jobs for around 5000 people in Glasgow as well as hundreds of apprenticeships, and thousands of jobs in the supply chain. Today's announcement gave the go-ahead for further work on the carriers.

The Secretary of State and Scotland Office officials have played a key role in the SDSR process, liaising with defence communities in Fife and Moray as well as submitting key economic evidence and advice to colleagues in the UK Government on behalf of Scotland.

Michael Moore, the Secretary of State for Scotland, said:

""The result of the basing review is good for Scotland and underlines the important part we play in keeping the UK safe and secure. ""There have been many changes but Scotland will remain at the heart of the UK's defence policy. I have fought hard to make Scotland's case heard throughout the process and the news today means Scotland has a sustainable, strategic and strong future in defence.

""We will have a bigger overall defence footprint than before the review and that proves beyond doubt that the UK Government is committed to Scotland and its future role as part of the UK.

""The inevitable changes reflect the tough choices which have been taken but we will see the Army presence double and one of three fast jet bases and a third of the UK's main naval bases remain here in Scotland.

""The fact Scotland will now have more defence personnel than before the review is a welcome result, especially against the backdrop of the £38 billion black hole we inherited in defence finances. In addition, Scotland will benefit from massive investment in infrastructure.""

"A paper published today by HM Treasury estimates that cutting Corporation Tax in Scotland to the same rate as Ireland could reduce overall spending power by a total of around £10bn to £12bn over a five year period.  The paper provides provisional HMRC estimates of both the 'direct' and 'behavioural' effects of cutting corporation tax to 12.5 per cent in Scotland and estimates that £2.6bn could be removed from the Scottish budget in a single year.

Appearing before the Scottish Affairs Committee in the House of Commons today, Scottish Secretary Michael Moore told MPs that it was this  sort of analysis that must inform the devolution debate.

Commenting on the tax paper, Michael Moore said:

""This paper makes clear the very real risks for Scotland in making changes to corporation tax without first looking at the details.  Cutting corporation tax to Irish levels would leave the Scottish Government with a gaping hole in its budget.

""To risk losing more than £2bn in spending power in a single year raises some serious questions that Scottish Ministers need to address in their proposals to devolve corporation tax. What cuts would be made? What other taxes would be increased?

""Analysts have examined a whole range of factors here. They have looked at the direct impact of a cut in Corporation Tax as well as the behaviour effects of 'profit shifting' and 'tax motivated incorporation'. It highlights not only the revenue involved but also the complexity involved in one tax change.  This doesn't even take into account the administrative costs  for government and business.

""The UK Government is already cutting Corporation Tax to one of the lowest levels in the G20, helping Scottish businesses to grow and generate new jobs.

""There are advantages to being able to share risks across a much wider tax base so that different parts of the UK support each other. Making changes to that system have to be carefully thought through and set out in real detail for everyone to analyse.

""A serious proposal for devolving new powers must be based on serious research and a credible case.  Ideology must not get in the way of the very real impact these decisions will have on Scotland's families and businesses.

""We await the substantial detailed case from the Scottish Government on Corporation Tax but we will not agree to anything that will damage Scotland's best interests.""

The paper estimating the cost of a reduction in the Corporation Tax rate in Scotland has been laid in the commons library.

""The UK Government is continuing to work hard to set the right conditions to put the country on a path to long term sustainable growth. However, I recognise that challenges remain and the Government's priority is to continue to support the economy by reducing the deficit and putting in place measures to encourage growth in the private sector. The Government's Growth Review continues for the rest of this Parliament, to provide an ongoing focus on what the Government can do to support growth.

""We have identified trade as one of the area that will help us to rebalance the economy. This is why we would like to see more small and medium sized Scottish companies trading overseas, as this is vital for Scotland's economy and creating long lasting jobs. For this reason we have created a new Scottish trade group which will support our aim to increase exports from Scotland.""

"Scottish companies are to be given a better chance to influence UK Government trade policy through the creation of a new group chaired by Scottish Secretary Michael Moore.

UK Trade Minister Lord Green is meeting with a range of Scottish business interests in Glasgow this morning to discuss the proposal. Hosted by David Mundell MP and the Scottish Council for Development and Industry (SCDI) the session with Lord Green is examining ways in which the UK Government can help Scottish more Scottish companies do business overseas.

The UK Government wants to draw on the expertise of bodies such as UK Trade and Investment (UKTI), Scottish Development International (SDI) and SCDI who are all working hard to help Scottish companies do more trade across the globe.

The Glasgow meeting is part of a two day Scottish programme where Lord Green has met bosses from Scottish business and enterprise bodies.

Many of the most important policy levers are controlled by the UK Government and Mr Moore believe Scottish firms need a clearer voice when it comes to influencing decisions over better regulation, international trade agreements and improving access to overseas markets. The Scottish Secretary said it is more important than ever that the different parts of the UK and Scottish Governments are all pulling in the right direction when it comes to helping Scottish companies.

Michael Moore said:

""I want to see more small and medium sized Scottish companies trading overseas. It is vital to Scotland's future economic prospects that this happens.  The UK Trade Minister has heard from Scottish business how the Government can help them trade across the world. I want Scottish business to have a more regular and direct channel to influence UK trade policy. A new Scottish trade group can help us achieve this.

""There is a lot of trade expertise in different parts of the UK and Scottish governments and in bodies such as SCDI.  I think this new group can help ensure that everyone is pulling in the right direction when it comes to helping Scottish firms do business overseas.""

Dr Lesley Sawers, Chief Executive, SCDI, said:

""SCDI has a long history of supporting Scottish businesses to break into international markets. In the current economic climate it is vital that we work in partnership with the government and private sector to ensure more business, particularly SMEs, to access the significant opportunities in some of the world's most dynamic economies. We welcome the opportunity to work with the Secretary of State and David Mundell  to develop the Scottish Trade Group and to achieve our global ambitions for Scotland.""

"The generosity of Scots can save lives in East Africa as the region experiences the worst drought in 50 years, the Secretary of State for Scotland said today (Friday 8 July).

Speaking as the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) announced the launch of its joint appeal, Michael Moore urged everyone in Scotland to give what they could to help support the ten million people estimated to be affected by the crisis in the region.

The UK Government has led the way and pledged £38 million to the World Food Programme of the UN which will help provide food aid.

The DEC appeals will be broadcast across a number of the UK's television channels today.

Large parts of Kenya, Somalia, Ethiopia and South Sudan are affected and around 1,000 refugees a day are arriving in the Dadaab refugee camp in eastern Kenya - many of them children.

Michael Moore said: ""Most of us will have seen the harrowing footage coming from East Africa and realise how precarious the situation is in the region. The UK Government has committed £38 million in aid already.

""People in Scotland have always responded generously to charity appeals and I hope they will do so again for this crisis. I realise this comes against a difficult economic backdrop in the UK, but the fact is that even the smallest amount can make a real difference to help get aid where it is needed.

"The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore today welcomed the UK Government's announcement of support for the oil and gas industry.

The Treasury is to extend the ring fence expenditure supplement (RFES) from 6% to 10% to help producers operating in marginal, less profitable fields following discussions with the sector. It is aimed at firms which do not make enough income to offset their exploration costs against corporation tax. The RFES currently allows companies to elect to increase the value of losses carried forward from one period to the next by 6% for a maximum of 6 years, not necessarily consecutively.

It will cost the Treasury around £50 million by the end of the 2015/16 fiscal year.

At the Budget, the Government announced: ""Recognising the importance of continued investment in the North Sea, including in marginal gas fields, the Government will also consider with the industry the case for introducing a new category of field that would qualify for field allowance.""  Today's announcement reflects the progress made so far in these discussions, and the Government will continue to engage closely with the oil and gas sector to consider the case for further support.

As part of a package of measures to help motorists cope with high petrol prices, the Government announced a Fair Fuel Stabiliser in the last Budget that would be funded by higher taxation of the profits from oil and gas companies when oil prices are high.

Michael Moore said: ""The Government has taken a positive step for the future of oil and gas exploration today and is acting on the pledges it made at the time of the last Budget. Support for the sector is important and this will help marginal fields by creating wider, fairer and more effective field allowances. We are going to continue to listen and work closely with the oil and gas companies to find ways to continue our support for the industry.""

"Responding to the Scottish Government's discussion paper on Corporation Tax published today, the Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore said:

""We welcome this contribution to the debate.

 

""The Scottish Government's paper accepts a lot of the difficulties that have been flagged up by ourselves and others. It accepts that devolving and cutting Corporation Tax will lead to a drop off in Scottish tax revenue. It also recognises the administrative complexity, extra costs and other problems such as profit shifting that need to be considered very carefully. The Institute of Chartered Accountants for Scotland and Price Waterhouse Coopers have highlighted some concerns over the past week and I am pleased that the Scottish Government recognises that problems do exist.

 

""The Treasury recently estimated that cutting Corporation Tax to the same level as Ireland would mean a drop in Scottish tax revenue of up to £2.7bn a year. At the time I said it raised serious questions about how such a cut would be financed and the Scottish Government's paper puts it rather well when it confirms that 'decisions regarding budgetary priorities would be needed'.

 

""In looking at what the Scottish Government's proposals, the UK Government is clear that it will not support anything that would expose the Scottish budget and economy to unreasonable risk.

 

""We should not forget that the UK Government is already in the process of cutting Corporation Tax to the lowest level in the G7, from which businesses across Scotland will benefit. The Scottish Government support this action but seem unduly concerned about who cuts the tax rather than what the tax level is.

 

""The UK Government will continue to contribute to this debate while awaiting the Scottish Government's final submission later this year.""

"Scotland is set to receive £68.8 million from the UK Government to help roll-out broadband to rural communities in Scotland.

 

The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore welcomed the news from the Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS).

 

The current Scottish Government will decide on how to use the money to support broadband access. Moore called on the Scottish Ministers to match the funding to ensure 90 per cent of homes and businesses in Scotland could have access to the internet.

 

The Secretary of State said:

 

""This is a major investment in rural broadband for Scotland. It means nearly £70 million of UK Government investment will go into improving the connectivity of rural areas. The Scottish Government should match the funding and help provide our rural communities with the broadband services they need so badly.

 

""Broadband provides a key lifeline for businesses and individuals and is long overdue in communities stretching from the Borders to the Highlands & Islands. This Government is investing in a change for the better and I hope the Scottish Government will follow that example.

 

He added:

 

""Bringing a minimum connection speed to rural areas has the potential to transform the way and interact with the rest of the world. It opens up a wide range of possibilities, from the way we do business to the way people access their public services. It is also a key factor in determining future investment in rural areas, including initiatives such as the provision of local TV services.

 

""Rural Scotland has previously been left behind in the race to improve internet access and speeds but this money will help make it viable for the private sector to invest in these areas. In challenging economic times, it makes sense to put government funding into initiatives like this which well help spur on the economy and job creation in rural areas.""

 

The funding is part of the UK Government's £530 million broadband investment fund, designed to ensure the UK has the best superfast broadband network in Europe by 2015, with 90 per cent of homes and businesses having access to superfast broadband and for everyone in the UK to have access to at least 2Mbps.

 

The allocations made today are based on need - the Government has looked at the areas where the market will fail to deliver superfast broadband to enough premises on its own, and the cost of that. It is not based on the number of people living or working in a county.

Lending to SMEs rose to £20.5 billion across the UK, up 22 per cent. The figures mean the Merlin banks are on track to hit their overall targets.

Scottish Secretary Michael Moore said:

 

""These figures are encouraging, but there is no room for complacency.  I will continue to engage with the banks to ensure they are living up to their promises and lending to businesses in Scotland.

 

""In my regular meetings with the banks, I made clear that Scottish business had a right to expect access to finance given their importance to Scotland's economic wellbeing. The Chancellor has been clear with the banks that they must do much more to meet their SME commitments by the end of the year.

 

""These figures show that the banks have taken these tough messages on board - lending to SMEs has increased by over 20% in the second quarter of the year. Although the banks are still slightly behind the SME commitment for the first half of the year, if this progress continues the banks should meet the target over the course of the year.""

The Minister also met a group of Ayrshire employers at a meeting hosted by Glaxo SmithKline, a follow up to the first youth unemployment seminar organised by the Scotland Office in May.

He said the manufacturing sector had grown in the last quarter against the backdrop of a difficult economic outlook, showing its resilience and flexibility. In addition, export orders were growing and the network of UK Government organisations and networks across the world were well placed to help Scotland's companies find new markets.

The Minister said the government was already taking steps such as creating the most competitive business tax system in the developed world and cutting corporation tax to the lowest point in the G7, as well as working to increase lending to business and cutting red tape.

He said the UK Government would use the Trade and Economic Growth Board to listen further to the concerns of business and act on the issues which were raised.   
  
Michael Moore said: ""The private sector has an important part to play in helping the UK's economic recovery.

""The relationship between technology and industry is more important than ever, particularly in creating and retaining a highly skilled workforce and developing solutions for the industries of the future, such as renewables. The Centre's work is pivotal to that process.

""At the same time, a company like ClydeUnion Pumps faces a different set of challenges in terms of working in markets around the world but also growing its Glasgow base and supporting 900 jobs. Rebalancing the economy is one of our priorities and the engineering sector has a key role  to play.

""The UK Government is playing its part. We  are continuing our rescue mission on our economy and dealing with the huge deficit we inherited and we are also taking practical steps to help companies, through initiatives such as UKTI's Britain Open for Business which promotes trade and investment.

""That can only help the types of company I have visited this week, such as Ampcontrol Allenwest which is exporting its designs and products to mining and energy markets across the world.

""I will work closely with businesses across Scotland in the coming weeks and months to make sure their voice is heard within government.

""Our aim is to improve trade and investment so more jobs are created at home. Our message to the world is a clear one - Scotland is open for business.""

"The Secretary of State for Scotland, Michael Moore is to write to the Scottish Government's Finance Minister asking for an explanation of the impact on Scottish Business of the Scottish Government's spending review.

He will also invite John Swinney to suggest how his government can contribute to the work of the new Scottish Trade and Growth Board which Mr Moore announced this week.

Moore said: ""I am alarmed at the reaction that the Scottish Government's Spending Review has provoked from the business community.

""In particular I'm concerned at the fears expressed about the projected business rates and the significant risk that they could prove a major disincentive to new investment in Scotland.

""The UK government, aware of the difficulties caused by the global financial situation, is currently trying to help business by reducing corporation tax, cutting red tape and keeping interest rates low.

""Scottish firms' fears that they could be facing a damaging hike in business rates set by the Scottish government must be addressed.

""Their reaction also underlines the need to focus on barriers to economic growth and the importance of the work of the recently announced Scottish Trade and Growth Board, where I hope Scotland's two governments can work together.

""But right now we need to know the assessment the Scottish Government  has made of the impact of their proposals, in particular with regard to business rates and the so-called 'Tesco Tax'.

""Far from being a panacea, the Scottish Government's so-called ""Plan  MacB"" has been shown to have a nasty sting in its tail.""

"Scotland's stunning countryside and cutting edge technology feature prominently in a new drive to promote Britain abroad.

The new GREAT campaign launched in New York last night by the Prime Minister includes images of the Glenfinnan Viaduct and bionic technology developed in Livingston as part of the drive to attract more investment, visitors and students to Britain.

The images can be seen [here](http://www.culture.gov.uk/images/publications/COUNTRYSIDE.pdf) and [here.](http://www.culture.gov.uk/images/publications/INNOVATION.pdf)

The UK Government is determined to seize the unprecedented opportunity of the Olympic and Paralympic Games and the Queen's Diamond Jubilee all taking place in 2012 and to maximise the economic legacy of these events.

The Prime Minister also announced plans for a ""Global Investment Conference"" for investors and business leaders to be held in London on the eve of the Games, an innovative programme of business summits including the ""British Business Embassy"" highlighting key sectors for global growth, and an on-line ""British Business Club"". The programme of business events will be delivered by UK Trade & Investment and is expected to generate, over time, at least a £1 billion boost for British business.

 Scottish Secretary Michael Moore said:

""Next year is a big year for Britain with tremendous opportunities. We want to deliver a lasting economic legacy for the whole of the Britain from the major events taking place here in 2012.

""Scotland features prominently in this new campaign to promote Britain overseas. We want this GREAT campaign to get more people to visit  and invest in all parts of Britain.

""The Glenfinnan viaduct is famous throughout the world to fans of the Harry Potter films. It is a stunning example of what tourists come to Scotland to see. 

""The people at Touch Bionics in Livingston can also be very proud that they are showcasing the best of British innovation across the globe. Their expertise transforms lives and it also helps our economy.

""These are two great examples of what Scotland and Britain have to offer. We are one of the very best places in the world to visit, live, work, study and do business.""

The GREAT campaign, which has been led by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), will promote the UK as one of the very best places to visit, study, work, invest and do business.   It will centre on ten key areas of British excellence: technology and innovation; entrepreneurship; creativity; knowledge; green; heritage; sport; shopping; music; and countryside.

The campaign materials will be used by UK Trade & Investment, DCMS, FCO, Visit Britain and other Government departments to ensure the whole of Government speaks with one voice.

DCMS announced on 9 June 2011 that creative communications agency Mother had been appointed to work with partners across Government to co-ordinate and develop communications activity to maximise the economic benefits of hosting the Olympics in 2012.  
  
The Global Investment Conference will be held on the eve of the Games and will see 200 of the world's leading business leaders meet with Government Ministers to discuss opportunities for growth and investment.

On each day of the Olympics the British Business Embassy will host a programme of events focusing on a different high growth sector each day. Over the course of the Games the British Business Embassy and associated events will give over 3,500 UK based companies the chance to showcase their capabilities to key overseas CEOs, buyers, influencers and decision makers.

"A new business group set up by the Secretary of State for Scotland will put Scotland at the heart of the UK's economic growth agenda.

Michael Moore today announced details of the Trade and Economic Growth Board he has established to assist the Scotland Office in the development of economic policy and to examine the specific ways it affects Scotland. It will add and feed into the UK Government's Growth Review and provide an active forum for businesses to discuss issues directly with the Cabinet minister responsible for Scotland.

The Board will bring together representatives from key sectors in the Scottish economy alongside expertise from within government, with support from the Treasury and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. It will also receive independent economic advice.

Michael Moore said: ""This Board will take the key issues for Scottish businesses and work through them with both urgency and precision. It gives us the opportunity to hear directly from businesses, both large and small, and work through those issues with economists and key government departments. It can only be good for Scotland's businesses to have a stronger voice as we look for the best ways to create growth in our economy. The ultimate aim is to identify the barriers that are holding Scotland back and find innovative ways of removing them. I very much look forward to working with the Board in Scotland's interests.""

The Board is intended to provide the Secretary of State with a sounding board for how the Scottish economy is responding to UK and Scottish government policies. It will also act as an interactive forum for business to discuss policies.

The Board will consist of senior people drawn from a range of major and SME businesses operating in Scotland. Board members are selected for their ability to bring to discussions an outstanding grasp of the strategic and practical issues facing Scottish businesses.

A number of high quality individuals have already accepted invitations. They include Neil Bruce  of AMEC, Allan Cook, of Selex Galileo, Paul Nelson of Allied Vehicles, and Neil McManus of Spirit Aerospace.

Board attendees are also expected to include external economists and representatives from other government departments.

The first meeting of the Board is expected to take place before the end of 2011 and the intention is to meet at least twice a year, or more often if members deem it necessary. An annual  trade forum for a wider audience will also be set up. Minutes of the meetings will be made available publicly through the Scotland Office website.

"Unemployment in Scotland fell by 3,000, to 204,000 in the period May to July 2011, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) data released today. The Scottish unemployment rate is 7.5 per cent, below the UK average of 7.9 per cent.   
The labour market statistics also show employment in Scotland has increased by 23,000 over the three months to May - July 2011. The number of those in employment in Scotland now stands at 2,496,000.

The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore said:

""This reduction in unemployment is welcome news, especially given the ongoing difficulties in the global economy. 

""Despite the difficult finances that this government has inherited, we are taking the decisions that create jobs and opportunities in the long-term.

""Our macroeconomic policy includes major measures to boost growth, with the creation of the most competitive business tax system in the developed world as we cut corporation tax progressively to the lowest rate in the G7.

""In addition, the UK Government has boosted tax relief for start-up companies and seen lending to businesses broadly on target through Project Merlin. The UK's credit rating has also been restored to its highest possible level.

""Many others agree with our approach, including the managing director of the IMF who endorsed the UK Government's plan on fiscal consolidation last week and said the UK Government's policy stance remains appropriate. Our plan has brought stability and confidence to the economy and abandoning this plan could undermine the recovery and further job creation.

""But we also know that to cut unemployment needs more than a return to growth: we need to understand and tackle the root causes of youth and long-term unemployment too.  The Work Programme is designed to do just that.  In addition, I recently held the latest in a series of youth unemployment seminars in Hawick, leading up to a Get Britain Working campaign launch event in Glasgow in October.""

"Youth unemployment in Scotland's rural areas came under the spotlight at a seminar convened by the Secretary of State for Scotland in Hawick today (1 September).

In the second in a series of Scotland Office seminars dealing with youth unemployment, Michael Moore emphasised the need for Scotland's two governments to work together to tackle the issue.  An audience of more than 60 stakeholders from government, local government, business bodies, local firms and employability organisations attended the event.

The Minister said:

""I wanted to hold the second seminar in a rural part of Scotland to explore the different labour market challenges facing young people. You're here because you care about the job prospects of young people in the Borders. Both Governments need to work harder together to ensure the best use is made of our respective resources.  Key partners need to collaborate more effectively to support young people into employment.

""Employers need to think about what they can do to ensure that young people get the chance to experience work to enable them to be more employable.""

Youth unemployment is a serious issue across Scotland.  The Borders has experienced a drop in employment rates over the two years to 2010, creating a challenging economic situation for young people entering the labour market.

Drawing on UK Government research and statistics, Michael Moore stressed to participants:

""The reality is that very few employers in Scotland recruited young people in the last two to three years. Small businesses regard recruiting young people, particularly inexperienced young people as high risk.

""Employers most often cited lack of work and life experience as the main reason for poor readiness for work.  These, of course, are skills which are best developed in work which is why giving young people the chance of work experience is so important.""

The UK Government is committed to improving the work readiness of young people in the Borders and across Scotland.  The Government's Work Experience scheme is giving young benefits claimants a two to eight week placement with an employer at no cost to the employer.  Borders employers including Hawick Knitwear, Lochcarron Knitwear, Plexus, NHS Borders, Marks and Spencer and Asda are working with Jobcentre Plus to offer work experience to young people.

After the seminar Michael Moore met 12 young people to discuss their experiences of unemployment and their search for work.

The first Scotland Office seminar to explore the different labour markets challenges facing young Scots was held in Irvine on 19 May.  A further seminar will be held in Falkirk and the lessons learned from the seminar series will be taken into an action-focused national convention in Dundee.

"Scottish Secretary Michael Moore has used a major speech in Edinburgh to say that the Scottish Government must start telling Scots what they mean by independence.

Speaking at the David Hume Institute,  Mr Moore listed six of the many questions on independence that Scots are entitled to know the answers to long before any referendum takes place.

Mr Moore said there was no rise in support for independence but that rather than ignore the challenge, ""we should take it on"".

He said the Scottish Government had been ""uncharacteristically shy in setting out exactly what independence would involve and what it would cost.""

The six questions set by the Secretary of State for the Scottish Government to answer  are:

1. What regulation would be applied to our banks and financial services and who would enforce it?

2. Which currency would Scotland adopt and how could entry and influence be guaranteed?

3. How would membership of international organisations - including the EU - be assured?

4. What will be our defence posture and the configuration of our armed forces?

5. How many billions would we inherit in pension liabilities and who would pay for future pensions?

6. How much would independence cost: what is the bottom line?

Michael Moore said there were also many organisational questions that still needed to be answered on what the referendum question would be, when it would be asked and who would run the referendum.

The Scottish Secretary used his speech to spell out the benefits that the Scotland Bill will bring to devolution. He called on the Scottish Government to focus more on using devolved powers and obsess less about the powers they don't have. Mr Moore also said that the constitutional change requires people to engage and build consensus.

Speaking to the David Hume Institute,  Michael Moore said:

""Among the Scottish people, independence remains very much a minority pursuit. In 1999, the Scottish Social Attitudes Survey showed that 27% of Scots wanted Scotland to separate from the UK. In 2009, that percentage was unchanged.

""And no opinion poll before or since has shown a majority of Scots in favour. The same survey shows that in both 1999 and 2009 support for a devolved Scotland within the UK hovered at around 60%.

""Whatever factors played a part in May's election result it was not a rise in support for Scottish independence. That is not to say we should ignore the challenge. On the contrary, we should take it on.

""So when the Scottish Government does come forward with its referendum proposals, there will need to be proper scrutiny. From politicians yes - but also from business, from civil society, from all groups and individuals with an interest in Scotland's future.

""What question will they ask?  How many questions will there be?  How will the campaign be conducted? And those are only the organisational aspects.

""They must also answer the substantive questions about what they mean by independence. They have been uncharacteristically shy in setting out exactly what independence would involve and what it would cost.

""The Scottish Government has unbounded enthusiasm for talking about its Six Demands of the Scotland Bill. But here are just six of the many questions for them on what an independent Scotland would look like.

Six specific questions, in six areas of key importance, that the Scottish Government must answer.

""What regulation would be applied to our banks and financial services and who would enforce it?

""Which currency would Scotland adopt and how could entry and influence be guaranteed?

""How would membership of international organisations - including the EU - be assured?

""What will be our defence posture and the configuration of our armed forces?

""How many billions would we inherit in pension liabilities and who would pay for future pensions?

""And above all - over all - how much would independence cost: what is the bottom line?

""The questions keep coming, the implications keep emerging and the imperative to answer keeps growing.

""Until the Scottish Government sets things out, the Scottish people are being asked to take a punt. But our future cannot be taken on trust; it's just too important.

""The politics of assertion can't pass the test - we need and deserve the detailed arguments. And soon. The real risk for Scotland is that the uncertainty caused by delay undermines public confidence in the Scottish Government's intentions and saps investor confidence when it comes to deciding where - that is in which country - jobs should be based.""

"Weeks  after the Scottish Government produced their paper on devolving Corporation Tax they have still to answer more than 40 questions put to them by Scottish business and HM Treasury.

Scottish Secretary Michael Moore urged the Scottish Government to start answering the questions if they wanted to be taken seriously on the matter.

The Scottish Government wants to see Corporation Tax devolved as part of the Scotland Bill legislation going through Westminster.  Scottish business organisations and the UK tax Minister have raised a number of questions which they would like answered as part of the consideration of this proposal.

Michael Moore also questioned the Scottish Government consultation which finished on September 5th and resulted in a final paper three days later without addressing any of the questions posed by those who responded.

Michael Moore said:

""Weeks after the Scottish Government produced their paper on devolving corporation tax we have heard nothing from them on the 40 or more questions that have been put to them by Scottish business and the Treasury.

""They must address these serious questions if they want to be taken seriously. I have always told the First Minister that we will consider any well argued case backed up by evidence. As it stands, their case for Corporation Tax clearly fails in this respect.

""CBI Scotland, Scottish Financial Enterprise, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland, the Scottish Chambers and SCDI have all taken the time to question the Corporation Tax proposals and it isn'tgood enough to simply ignore them. The First Minister has said that he doesn' have a monopoly on wisdom and with complex tax matters he should listen to Scottish business.

""My colleague, David Gauke, the Minister responsible for the UK tax system, has also asked questions and been met with the same wall of silence. It really isn' good enough. The nature of the consultation was always dubious. It ended on September 5th and produced an outcome on September 8th without pausing for any reflection.""

32.  If by borrowing, how much would such borrowing cost?

33. Are there any specific implications for businesses based in Scotland but serving customers mainly in the rest of the UK?

34. Where would they pay tax on their activities and how could devolving corporation tax improve their competitive position?

35 . Within the UK, will different rates of corporation tax distort the allocation of resources and investments within a notionally single market?

36 . Or make that allocation more efficient?

37. Is there a causal link between rates of corporation tax and economic growth?

38. Will the introduction of differing rates of corporation tax within the UK encourage or discourage potential inward investors from setting up headquarters, subsidiaries or branches in the UK or in Scotland?

39. We believe that further work and evidence is required to ascertain what the actual economic impact of devolution of corporation tax to Scotland would be.  This remains unclear at the moment.  What would the economic impact be and when?

40. We believe that a broader view of the drivers of economic success needs to be considered when debating the likely impact of devolution of corporation tax.  Will companies make strategic decisions based on corporation tax rates alone or what other conditions drive decision making?

41. We believe further work would be required on assessing the impact on the public finances of there were to be a short, medium or long term reduction in tax revenue due to a lower rate of corporation tax being levied in Scotland.  What will the revenues be?

42. We believe that the constituent  parts of the tax base need to be defined.  In other words, which companies would pay corporation tax in Scotland?  81% of corporation tax in the UK comes from 1% of the companies.  What proportion of this tax would be payable in Scotland?  This needs defined before we can estimate the shortfall or surplus compared to current revenues?

43. Finally, our members have expressed concerns that if a separate tax authority were set up to administer corporation tax in Scotland they would not welcome the potential complexity and burden of dealing with two tax authorities ¿ the Scottish Tax Agency and HMRC.

"The UK Government's plans to change the rules on succession to the throne will finally bring rules on succession into the modern era and ensure the values of equality in our society are mirrored in the monarchy, the Secretary of State for Scotland said today.

He was speaking after the Prime Minister announced unanimous agreement had been reached with heads of Commonwealth countries where the Queen is Head of State to make changes to laws on succession dating back to the 17th century. It will allow any daughters of the monarch to succeed the throne ahead of male heirs on the basis of age rather than gender and will also remove the existing bar that prevent a potential monarch marrying a Catholic.

Michael Moore said:

""Scotland will welcome the changes to these ancient rules which recognise the right of an elder daughter to succeed the throne ahead of younger male sibling and removes the ban on the monarch marrying a Catholic. The changes mean if the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's eldest child is a girl then she will become Queen some day.

""This move reflects the modern values of the UK and will bring an end to an outdated set of rules which have little place in a country dedicated to equality and tolerance.

""Previous Governments have failed to act on this issue as it is difficult to sort out all the different legislation. This government is taking the initiative as it believes it sends an important signal on discrimination and our determination to change the rules on succession for the better.""

" The Scottish budget - even including every penny of oil and gas revenue - has run a £41 billion deficit over the past 30 years, according to a forthcoming Scotland Office analysis of official figures. 

The Secretary of State said the figures show that including oil and gas revenues could not pay for the same level of spending in a separate Scotland and called on the Scottish Government to explain exactly how much a separate Scotland would cost.

Scotland Office economists are set to produce figures, based on the Scottish Government's own GERS data, which demonstrate the continuing economic benefits of the United Kingdom and the dangers of opening up an economy to the peaks and troughs of oil prices.

A separate Scotland would face fluctuations in its annual budget because of the year to year changes in the value of oil revenue.

For instance, over the past two years oil and gas revenues have accounted for 1.3% and 2.4% of overall UK tax revenue.

In a separate Scotland, these revenues would have seen oil and gas account for 13% and 23% of the budget in those respective years, creating significant year-on-year changes to the amount Scotland had to spend and making forward budgeting extremely difficult. 

Michael Moore said:

""It is time for straightforward answers on the Scottish budget and oil and gas revenues. We have seen a raft of claims about those figures recently but the people of Scotland deserve to have the numbers at their disposal and an understanding of what independence would mean for Scotland's budget.

""Many supporters of separation point to North Sea oil and gas revenues when they start talking about how an independent Scotland would be financed. But the truth is that the facts don't back up this logic.

""Economists in the Scotland Office have studied the Scottish Government's own revenue and expenditure figures and produced data which puts North Sea revenues into some proper context.

""These figures show that in the last 30 years, the UK and Scottish Governments have spent £197bn more in Scotland than the total tax generated in Scotland.

""If you had allocated every single penny of oil and gas revenues to Scotland over the past 30 years - a figure of £156 billion - then you would still fall £41 billion short of what both governments have actually invested in Scotland.

 ""The oil and gas sector is absolutely vital for Scotland and Britain. Let there be no doubt about that. But when we start talking about how a separate Scotland will be financed then we should also stick to the facts.

 ""The Scottish Government has tell us what the financial cost of independence would be for Scotland. They must provide answers.""

"Michael Moore has held meetings with energy companies, consumer groups and Ofgem today (Thursday 20 October) to help find ways to help people get their bills down and cut through the bewildering array of tariffs and packages currently on offer.

The Minister met representatives of the big six energy companies in Bathgate, days after the Energy Secretary held a similar meeting in London.

He said: ""This winter we want people across Scotland to be paying as little as possible for their energy. While we can't control the volatility of energy prices, with world energy prices up 29%, but we can look at ways to help the consumer cut through the mass of confusing tariffs and pricing that currently exists to make sure they get the best deal. We want to work with the energy companies to make that happen.

""The UK Government is taking robust, targeted action on this issue. We're paying a £120 rebate to more than 600,000 of our most vulnerable pensioners and we're maintaining the vital winter fuel payment and cold weather payments.""

Last Friday, Ofgem announced radical reforms which will overhaul and simplify tariffs, protecting consumers from price rises and hidden charges and encouraging new players, like supermarkets and co-operatives, to enter energy markets by forcing suppliers to sell more of their electricity on the open market. Ofgem is being given significantly enhanced powers to implement these changes as quickly as possible.

The government is also working with Ofgem on:

- Fines on miss-selling

- Ensuring consumers can get money back on redress

- Simplifying tariffs so people can get better deals

"The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore today said the First Minister's attack on Westminster as one of Scotland's two governments is a direct attack on the respect agenda and shows a ""worrying disregard for the Scottish electorate"".

His comments came after _Holyrood _magazine published an interview in which the First Minister which referred to the Scottish Affairs Committee's recent decision to hold inquiries into the Scottish Government's referendums. 

Michael Moore said:

""The constitution is clearly a matter for Scots in Parliament and government at Westminster and it is disrespectful and wrong to try pushing Scots and their elected representatives out of the debate on their country's future.

""Scotland has two governments and representatives in two Parliaments whether particular politicians like it or not.  The respect agenda must be observed by both governments, and to the benefit of the Scottish people.

""It is not only right but essential that those elected by the Scottish people can scrutinise the Scottish Government's case for independence and weigh up its evidence and arguments. If the Scottish Government thinks it can hold a referendum without real scrutiny and full debate, it is badly mistaken.

""The May election gave the Scottish Government a mandate to govern devolved matters in Scotland, not to disregard the constitution or shut down public debate. Given that the coalitions parties won more votes than the Scottish Government received in 2011, it is also clear that each government has a distinct and legitimate mandate.""

"The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore described the first meeting of the Scottish Emergency Towing Vessel Group in Edinburgh this afternoon as ""a positive step in the right direction"".

He was speaking after chairing the group which is investigating potential long-term solutions for emergency towing cover in waters around the Northern and Western Isles. The original contract ended a fortnight ago and the UK Government announced it had secured interim funding for three months to cover the ETVs. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) awarded the new 90-day contract to JP Knight last Friday. The tugs were back on station at the weekend.

The Scottish ETV Group saw representatives of Shetland, Orkney, Highland and the Western Isles Councils as well as the MCA, Department for Transport, Marine Scotland, KIMO and the Chamber of Shipping discuss the outline approach to the issue. The Scotland Office Minister David Mundell also attended.

Michael Moore said: ""This was a practical and constructive first meeting. We are determined to do everything we can to find a viable, long term alternative. Our discussions today were focused on what Scotland needs from its ETVs and what the options may be in finding a long-term replacement. We worked well across a wide range of interests and I am confident we can put the huge level of expertise and experience represented on the Group to good work.""

The Convener of Orkney Council Stephen Hagan welcomed today's meeting on behalf of the Group.  He commented: ""We are pleased that the Government is looking for a long-term solution and we are happy to play our part to work towards that.  We are hopeful that we can reach an outcome that is mutually acceptable.""

The labour market statistics also show employment in Scotland has decreased by 24,000 over the three months to June - August 2011. The number of those in employment in Scotland now stands at 2,474,000.

""These figures are a difficult reminder of the task we face in continuing our fight for jobs in Scotland. The rise in unemployment is undoubtedly a painful one and a cause for concern, particularly for those families and individuals directly affected by a job loss.

 ""But we should not lose our focus. The UK government is doing all it can do to support the economy and our plan to reduce the deficit is the right one, particularly when we see the way difficult economic circumstances are affecting other countries.

""Our actions, such as the creation of the most competitive tax system in the G20 and reducing corporation tax to 23 per cent by 2014, will help create the right conditions for balanced and sustainable economic growth.

""Tackling youth unemployment is also a priority and I am working with groups and organisations across Scotland to address the issue.  I have worked closely with  employers, young people and other stakeholders in a series of seminars and meetings so far and will hold a national convention next year.

"The Scottish Secretary Michael Moore is seeking urgent clarification from the Scottish Government on whether it wants Holyrood to have control over Excise Duty or control over the revenue it raises.

Moore said the paper produced by the Scottish Government was full of contradictions.  In places it talks of  ""devolution of revenues"" and in others it refers to  ""devolving alcohol duties"". The news release calls for the revenues to be devolved while the draft amendment in Annex A would actually devolve the power over excise duties on alcohol.

Michael Moore said:

""This is very frustrating. We have been waiting for months for detailed evidence and when we finally get it we are left wondering what they are actually asking for.  Are they asking for the power over alcohol duties or are they just asking for the cash? The paper is full of contradictions and differs from the press release and the draft amendment.

""The First Minister was clear in May that he wanted control of the taxes. I now need urgent clarification from the Scottish Government if they have shifted their position. We will be getting in touch with them straight away.

""When it comes to tax powers the position of Scottish Government Ministers gets more confusing by the minute.

""Meanwhile, the hard work on delivering the largest ever transfer of financial powers to the Scottish Parliament continues at the UK Government. The Scotland Bill will make devolution stronger than ever before .""

"The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore has announced that he is to lead Scotland's biggest trade mission of Scottish business to Brazil in late November. The visit will coincide with St Andrew's Day on 30 November.

The news comes on the day official figures showed Scottish exports continuing to grow by 1.1% in the last quarter.

Scotland currently exports around £180m of goods to the country annually but the Minister wants to see more trade develop to help Scotland and the rest of the UK on the return to economic growth.

The UK Government has recently announced its hope to double exports to Brazil by 2015.  Michael Moore said making the most of new export markets is a key factor in getting the economy back to health and that Scotland is best placed to do so as part of the UK and its trade networks.

The trade mission organised by the Scottish Council Development and Industry (SCDI), with funding support from UKTI and SDI, will visit Brasilia, Rio and Sao Paolo and allow companies from a wide range of Scottish sectors to showcase their services and establish links in a high-growth market which has become increasingly important to the global economy.

Brazil offers huge opportunities for Scottish exporters and has a GDP growth greater than that of China or India. Latin America is set to represent 8 per cent of the global economy by 2020.

The delegation will include sectors such as whisky and other food and drink, energy, education, healthcare, finance, engineering, high tech manufacturing and tourism.

Among the companies taking part are:

- Gentech, which designs, develops and manufactures a range of sensing solutions for measuring level, flow and position  
- Global Solutions (AIC) Ltd, which provides a range of products and services to the Oil, Gas and Petrochemical industries  
- Gordon & MacPhail, one of the world's leading malt whisky specialists which  currently bottles over 70 single malts  
- High Voltage Instruments, which manufacturers market-leading high voltage products for electricity utility companies and major industrials worldwide  
- HSBC, one of the world's largest banks  
- Nautronix, a marine technology company specialising in subsea acoustics

Michael Moore said: ""I am delighted to be leading the largest delegation of Scottish business to visit Brazil so far. It is a key market for our exporters and we have the goods, services and skills which a country like Brazil needs at this point in its history.

""We will miss no opportunity on this trip to promote Scotland across the board. Our key message will be that we are open for business with the Brazilian market and further across the globe.

""This trade mission demonstrates the clear economic benefit to Scotland of its membership of the UK.

 ""We have access to a world-class consular network and trade support around the world, with a new UK consul due to open in Brazil shortly, and we will see business sectors across Scotland make the most of that global stature and reach in November.""

Welcoming the announcement, the Chief Executive of SCDI Dr Lesley Sawers, who will also take part in the delegation, said:

 ""Inspiring and enabling Scotland's businesses to grow and trade internationally is a key priority for SCDI.

""There are huge opportunities in Brazil for businesses in our core sectors of excellence including food and drink, education, finance, oil and gas, engineering and construction.

""In addition, Brazil as hosts of the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympics offers opportunities linked with Scotland's strengths in delivering major sporting events and infrastructure

""We welcome the Secretary of State for Scotland's leadership of this trade visit which will reinforce Scotland¿s commitment to supporting our businesses in achieving their global ambitions in this exciting market.""

"The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore today confirmed up to £3 million of interim funding will be provided from the UK Government for replacement tugboats in the Northern and Western Isles.  Funding will be delivered on an exceptional basis for three months to allow final attempts to secure a long-term replacement to continue.    
   
Michael Moore said:  ""I am aware of the strength of feeling on this issue expressed by communities in the Northern and Western Isles.  It is disappointing that efforts by local representatives to secure a commercial replacement for this service were unsuccessful before expiry of the contract.  
   
""I believe it is worth a final attempt to try and find a solution, and the Scotland Office has agreed to lead the efforts.  The UK Government is to offer funding to cover replacement services for an interim period and I am speaking to local authorities today on how this should work.  Work is already underway and we are hopeful that a replacement service can be put in place as soon as practically possible.  
   
""Everyone must be clear that this cannot be a long-term solution.  The majority of traffic in these waters is owned by private companies and we will be engaging with them and others to find a satisfactory alternative.""

Commercial and salvage industry can be used by operators to assist ships in difficulty. There are a variety of means of securing this form of assistance if needed, including invoking powers to secure vessels from commercial providers. We are confident that if a vessel of this kind is required, there are sufficient commercial operators available to draw on.

The Minister will convene a meeting of a UK ETV group shortly and further details will be announced in due course.

"Scotland is stronger as part of the UK's defence and national security arrangements, the Secretary of State Michael Moore said today (Mon 3 October).

The Minister was aboard the landing platform dock ship HMS Bulwark on the Clyde for the NATO exercise ""Joint Warrior"" being carried out in Scotland this month. It is one of the largest military exercise in Europe and involves a number of key NATO partners.

It is a maritime, air and land Exercise that will take place predominantly in Scotland, the Western Isles and North West Approaches, the Borders region, North East England and the North Sea. It provides a joint, multi-threat environment in which UK, NATO and Allied units undertake collective training in preparation for employment in a Combine Joint Task Force.

It typically includes between 20 and 30 Naval participants and around 75 aircraft as well as ground-based units.

The Minister took part in the exercise to learn more about the strategic aspects of defence and the Royal Navy in Scotland and met a number of senior Royal navy officers and staff.

Michael Moore said: ""If any demonstration was needed of the flexibility and capacity the UK's military has by being part of NATO, the ""Joint Warrior"" exercise makes the point perfectly. We have units from members across the globe working together to prepare for joint military roles and Scotland is playing a key part in supporting that training as part of the UK.

The Minister was also at HMRNB Clyde, which remains on track to become the single base of operations for all the UK's submarine fleet, including the Astute and vanguard class vessels.  The base is Scotland's biggest single employment site with a staff exceeding 7000.

The Minister said: ""The fact Faslane is going to act as the UK's main submarine base show how deeply interwoven defence and Scotland continue to be. Being part of the United Kingdom is key to the present and future defence of Scotland and we should not forget just how many people are employed on the Clyde. That can only happen while we are part of the UK and the detail of its future is a key question for those who would pull us out of NATO and the wider network of our military allies to answer.""

"Scottish Secretary Michael Moore has confirmed that the devolved Scottish Government budget will increase by £67.5m as a result of Barnett formula consequentials from announcements made today by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.

The Chancellor announced today that by driving through efficiency savings ahead of schedule the UK Government  has freed up resources which will see the Council tax frozen in England and £67.5m of additional spending go to Scotland.

As normal, the consequential will not be ringfenced and can be taken up in a Supplementary Estimate. It will be for Scottish Ministers at Holyrood to allocate these new resources.

The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore said:

""The UK Government has worked hard to strip out waste in the public sector and create efficiencies over the last 16 months. Scotland is now going to be £67.5m better off as a result of making those savings and the Chancellor using them to keep household costs down.

""Scottish  Ministers will have to decide for themselves how best to spend that money. Its recent priorities at the Spending Review hit business hard while in contrast the Chancellor made a number of changes which will be beneficial for business today. The Scottish Government would be wise to follow suit and invest in growing the Scottish economy and repairing some of the damage done to the sector's confidence.""

"Michael Moore has called on everyone in Scotland to use our national day to reflect on the future of our country and its prospects as we face both global economic and constitutional uncertainty.

Hosting a reception in Brazil during Scotland's biggest ever trade mission to the country with SCDI, the Secretary of State said:

""Celebrating our national day is a chance to reflect on our achievements, hopes and values as a nation both at home and abroad. We can do so with pride knowing that Scots have helped shape the world for the better in the past and continue to do so in the present day, whether living here or as part of the wide diaspora across the globe.

""Scotland continues to play an important part in the world and I am spending this St Andrew's Day on the largest ever trade mission to Brazil by Scottish companies as we look to establish links and create opportunities in important markets around the world.

"UK Export Finance is guaranteeing a $1 billion line of credit for Petroleo Brasileiro Sociedade Anonima (Petrobras) to finance UK exports for Petrobras' investment programme.

The line of credit is to expand Petrobras' oil exploration and production facilities off the east coast of Brazil. It will be provided through HSBC and other lenders.

Petrobras will nominate export contracts with UK based companies to be financed from the line of credit. Supplies under consideration include rigs and vessels for exploration, remotely operated vehicles, control systems, compressors, global positioning services and hardware.

Prior to reaching its decision to support the line of credit UK Export Finance carried out a review to determine that Petrobras¿ environmental and social policies and practices meet international standards. The review took into account reports produced by the US Bureau of Ocean Energy Management Regulation and Enforcement and BP following the Macondo incident in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.

The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore, who is currently heading the largest ever Scottish trade mission to Brazil organised by the SCDI, said:

""This guarantee is fantastic news for British companies and will be of particular help to firms in the North Sea oil and gas industry in Scotland. We have built up a huge amount of expertise in the drilling and exploration industries over the years as well as forging ahead with the new technologies needed to meet the emerging challenges facing the global industry. Today's news of an export guarantee underlines the important links we are building with Brazil and other emerging economies which will be of benefit to Scottish business.""

The UK Minister for Trade, Lord Green, said:

""UK companies have a strong track record in oil exploration through their work in the North Sea. This line of credit will help these companies boost their exports to Brazil and will take the best of British technology to this important and growing market. I look forward to hearing about successes for companies of all sizes, from right across the UK, as a result of this UK Export Finance facility.""

"The Scottish Secretary Michael Moore said today's Autumn Statement provides ""real help for Scotland at a time when parts of Europe are facing real crisis"".

Moore said that by sticking to the deficit reduction plan, the UK was avoiding the problems of some Eurozone countries and able to invest hundreds of millions of pounds extra in Scotland.

The Autumn Statement set out measures that will help pensioners, young unemployed and motorists in Scotland. On top of this, the Chancellor's statement means that Scotland will receive an additional £433m in Barnett consequentials for capital projects which are vital for economic growth.

This new money is in addition to the recent announcement of £100m for the Scottish Government to invest in renewable energy in Scotland and a further £200m in extra Barnett  consequentials that have already been announced since last year's Spending Review.

""In tough economic times the UK is keeping the confidence of the markets, keeping mortgage rates down and finding ways to invest more in Scotland,"" said Michael Moore.

Measures announced by the Chancellor today that will help Scotland:

* The Youth Contract, which will see Government fund incentives for companies taking on young people, extra support from JobCentre Plus for unemployed 18-24 year olds and an offer of work experience or a sector based work academy place for every unemployed 18-24 year old who wants one.

* The 3p fuel duty increase planned for January 2012 will be deferred.

* The basic state pension increase will benefit 1 million Scottish pensioners.

* The Government will make £50m available to enable the replacement of the cross-border Caledonian Sleeper fleet to improve on-train facilities. This exceptional funding is subject to the Scottish Government agreeing to co-fund the replacement programme.

* Small and medium size Scottish companies will potentially also benefit from the credit easing measures announced today.

* Investment in telecoms, including broadband, will improve coverage in the more rural parts of the UK. Edinburgh will also become one of 10 UK super-connected cities.

Scottish Secretary Michael Moore said:

""This Autumn statement comes at a difficult economic time. By sticking to our deficit reduction plan the UK has avoided the problems facing some Eurozone countries.

""The measures announced by the UK Government today provide real help for Scotland at a time when parts of Europe are facing real crisis.  In tough economic times the UK is keeping the confidence of the markets, keeping mortgage rates down and finding ways to invest more in Scotland. This clearly demonstrates the benefits to Scotland of being part of the UK.

""The job of growing our economy falls to Scotland's two governments. The UK has announced wide ranging measures to help Scottish companies access credit, to delay increases in fuel duty and to help the young unemployed in Scotland. We are also investing in broadband and increasing the state pension. This is just some of what we are doing to help Scotland.

""We have also provided an extra £433m to the Scottish Government so that they can invest in capital projects in Scotland. This is new money that Holyrood was not accounting for so I am sure it will be welcomed. If it is used wisely then it can make a significant impact in growing Scotland's economy in the years to come.""

"Two Scottish companies have announced plans to open new offices in Rio de Janeiro on the opening day of the largest ever Scottish trade mission to Brazil.

Scottish Secretary Michael Moore praised the ambition of the two companies, Nautronix and Reel  Group, who both work in the energy sector.

Speaking from Rio de Janeiro, Michael Moore said:

""Brazil is a very important market for Scottish energy companies. Brazil is one of the fastest growing economies in the world and they value the expertise that Scotland has when it comes to energy.

""These companies are showing real ambition in taking their expertise to South America and doing business here. I wish them every success in their new ventures.

""There are other Scottish energy-related companies out here on this mission who are establishing and strengthening contacts with a view to future opportunities. We are here to help companies build new relationships and break new ground.

"Scotland's largest ever trade mission to Brazil gets underway this weekend with Scottish Secretary Michael Moore saying the world sporting calendar provides Scotland with a ""unique selling point"" as Scottish companies try to do business with one of the world's fastest growing economies. 

Many countries are courting Brazil but Mr Moore said Scotland is ideally placed because of the links being generated between the UK and Brazil thanks to the two nations hosting the most prestigious global sporting events over the next five years. He will be meeting with members of the Olympic and World Cup organising committees. 

While the UK and Scotland will hold the 2012 London Olympics,  Paralympics, 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games and the 2014 Ryder Cup, Brazil is hosting the football World Cup in 2014 and the Rio Olympics and Paralympics in 2016. 

The Scottish trade delegation being led by Michael Moore represents a wide range of sectors including education, food and drink, sport, energy, finance  and engineering. The organisations are drawn from across Scotland.

As well as a series of business meetings in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, the Scottish Secretary will also attend a St Andrew¿s night reception and meet with Brazilian Government Ministers in the capital, Brasilia.

Speaking ahead of the trade mission, Michael Moore said:

""Brazil has no shortage of countries wishing to do business with it. I am confident that the expertise of Scottish companies means that we can take on the rest of the world. I also think that world sporting calendar  provides the Scotland with it¿s unique selling point for the next few years. The fact that the UK and Brazil are hosting the world¿s most prestigious sporting events over the next 5 years is providing a great link between our two countries and we need to maximise that advantage.

""Scotland has such great products that we set off to places like South America with real confidence that we can do business that will lead to benefits for our economy."" 

Official figures showed Scottish exports continuing to grow by 1.1% in the last quarter.

 Scotland currently exports around £180m of goods to Brazil  annually but the Minister wants to improve Scotland¿s trade links with Brazil.

 The UK Government has recently announced its hope to double bilateral trade with Brazil by 2015.

"The Secretary for Scotland, Michael Moore, announced today Scotland's first National Convention on Supporting Youth Employment to be held in Dundee on 15 March 2012. Iain Duncan Smith, the Work and Pensions Secretary and John Swinney, the Cabinet Secretary for Employment will both speak at the convention. Mr. Moore has met with over 600 people in 6 months and will take what he has heard to a meeting of labour market, employment and skills experts in two weeks time (8 December) in preparation for the Dundee convention.

The Secretary of State for Scotland hosted a youth unemployment seminar in Falkirk yesterday. This was one of a series of events that the UK Government has hosted across Scotland that brings young people together to discuss the challenges faced when seeking employment. The first two events were held in Ayrshire and Hawick.

The event in Falkirk was well attended and included cross party local councillors and council leaders. Representatives were also there from Job Centre Plus and a number of local employers including, Diageo, Argos, and Ineos as well as over twenty young people. It was an opportunity for people to listen to the experiences of the young people who are actively seeking employment and hear the challenges and barriers they face.

Today the Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg, announced £1 billion over three years to help people through a range of measures. 250,000 young people will be offered Work Experience places. The youth contract scheme will give employers subsidies worth £2,275 to take on 160,000 18-to 24-year-olds, for six months, over three years. More support at job centres will be made available for young people with career advice and help with interview techniques.

The coalition Government introduced the Work Experience scheme to help young benefits claimants gain work experience and employment. Early evaluation of this scheme is hugely positive and shows that half of the young people who have taken part were off benefits within a month of finishing their placements.

Michael Moore said, ""The UK Government is committed to helping young people in Scotland get off benefits and into employment. The £1 billion announced today will help the unemployed find work and make it easier for employers to take on young people.  Yesterday was another useful opportunity to listen to a wide range of opinions on how to tackle youth unemployment in the Forth Valley area. We have introduced a series of schemes that are tailored to local needs and give young Scots the fair chance they need.""

"Two thirds of the civil servants working in Scotland are employed by the UK Government and provide vital and wide ranging services for individuals and communities, Scottish Secretary Michael Moore said today as the Department for International Development (DfID) prepared to mark 30 years in East Kilbride.

There are almost twice as many UK Government civil servants working in Scotland as there are of those who work for the Scottish Government.

The two largest civil service employers in Scotland are Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and Job Centre Plus with 9,860 and 9,020 staff respectively. The Scottish Government's core staff is the third largest with 5,460 employees.

Mr Moore presented UK civil service statistics showing that the UK Government  employ more than 31,000 staff in Scotland as he and International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell prepare to visit East Kilbride (on Thursday) to mark thirty years of the Department for International Development being based in the town.

Civil service statistics show:

* There are almost twice as many UK Government civil servants working in Scotland as there are of those who work for the devolved government.

*  There are 48,830 civil servants working in Scotland and 31,690 (65% of the total) work for parts of the UK Government such as the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP), Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and the Ministry of Defence (MoD).

* Different parts of the Scottish Government employ 17,250 (35% of the Scottish total).  The UK Government employs 18,080 women in Scotland.

* The UK Government provides 10,000 more Scottish jobs for women than the Scottish Government.  The UK Government currently employs 18,080 women in Scotland and the Scottish Government employs 8,060. Women account for 57% of the total UK civil service jobs in Scotland. Women account for 47% of the total Scottish Government jobs.

* The largest single civil service employer in Scotland is HMRC with 9,860 employees. Next comes Job Centre Plus with 9,020 staff, the core Scottish Government with 5,460 staff and then the MoD with 5,340.

* DfID in East Kilbride employ 490 staff and is marking thirty years in the town.

* The nature of many of the UK civil service posts means that they are located in many different parts of Scotland.

Michael Moore said:

""The fact the UK Government accounts for two-thirds of the total civil service jobs in Scotland is a useful reminder that Scotland has two governments, working for Scotland, in the interests of Scotland. The work of the UK Government in Scotland stretches into many different aspects of peoples everyday lives, helping people find jobs, paying out pensions and tax credits and ensuring that cold weather payments reach those who need them. Whether it is defending our coastline our obtaining a passport to go on holiday, the UK Government has people in Scotland who are here doing a job for you.

""These 31,000 jobs are important for communities across Scotland and for the families of all those serving the Government in different ways. More than 18,000 of the UK posts in Scotland are filled by women.

""The fact that the Department for International Development (DfID) is celebrating 30 years in East Kilbride shows the benefits of spreading UK jobs around the UK.  East Kilbride serves as an engine room for much of the life saving work that DfID do across the globe. Everyone at Abercrombie House can be extremely proud of what they and their predecessors have achieved in the past three decades.""

"Extended 12 week work placements are helping young Scots to have a better chance of finding a job, Scottish Secretary Michael Moore said. He said that JobCentre Plus is now offering employers in Scotland the chance to take on young people for an extra four weeks Work Experience if it leads to an apprenticeship.

The Minister was speaking on the day the Business Secretary Vince Cable announced measures to make it easier and more attractive for firms to take on apprentices.

Over the past six months the Secretary of State for Scotland has been promoting a collaborative approach to supporting young people into jobs in Scotland. In partnership with local Councils, he has held events across Scotland to bring together employers, young people key partners to tackle youth unemployment.

Michael Moore said:

""I have been holding youth employment seminars across Scotland and devolved subjects like skills and apprenticeships are regularly raised with me.  This means  it is vital that both UK and Scottish Governments work together in supporting youth employment across Scotland.

""We must ensure that the resources of the UK and Scottish Governments work harder and better. A good example of this is that JobCentre Plus are now offering employers in Scotland the chance to take on young people for an extended 12-week Work Experience placement  if it leads to an apprenticeship. This can make a real difference to a young person and they will continue to receive benefits during these 12 weeks.

""I have met young Scots who have received help and managed to turn their life chances around. Youth unemployment is one of the biggest challenges facing Scotland right now and everyone needs to pull together to make sure we do everything we can for this generation.""

The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore said:

""The Scottish unemployment figures are a stark reminder we cannot allow any let up in our efforts to get the economy back to full health and people back into work as soon as possible. Each of these numbers represents an individual or a family directly affected by the economic downturn and the UK Government is doing all it can to create growth and reverse this trend.

""The urgency of protecting the UK economy has never been clearer as we witness events in the Eurozone. It is essential that we keep working towards securing strong and sustainable growth for the long term.

""Youth unemployment is a specific concern and I will meet labour market and  employment and skills experts next week to look at the issue in depth. That will help shape the objectives of Scotland's first national youth convention I have organised for March next year, which follows on from a series of seminars across Scotland. These have brought together Council leaders, employers, UK and Scottish Government agencies and local providers to work harder and better for the benefit of jobless young Scots. ""

"The UK Government's defence contracts across Scotland continue to play a vital role in the defence of the nation and sustaining jobs and skills, the Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore said today (Monday 14 November).

The Minister was at Babcock in Rosyth for an update on progress on the Royal Navy's new Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carrier.

He met management and workers on a tour of the site which included the 90-metre-high Goliath crane which is on site to aid the construction of the vessels.

Scotland's essential role was underlined at the Defence Review last year when the multi-billion pound contract for the carriers was confirmed. Work on the Queen Elizabeth class is anticipated to create or sustain around 5,000 jobs at shipyards in Glasgow and Fife alone, as well as around 2,000-3,000 in the supply chain.

Babcock employs around 2,500 people between its west and east coast shipyards, and the The Queen Elizabeth programme has seen the company employ over 150 apprentices at Rosyth.

Michael Moore said:

""Scotland plays a key role in supporting the UK's defence sector and the progress being made on the next generation of our aircraft carriers shows the commitment and skill of our workforce. The work is supporting not only jobs and the expertise which has been built up over decades, but also smaller companies in the supply and local communities.

""Being part of the UK means Scotland maintains access to this sort of spending and I am keen to see that continue. There is no doubt that the issue of a referendum continues to cause uncertainty in the sector and it is important for the future of Scotland's defence industries and the many thousands who work in them for the issue to be cleared up as soon as possible.""

"In 2010 there was record £8.5 billion gap between UK Government spending on welfare and pensions in Scotland and all the revenue raised from North Sea oil and gas.

Scottish Secretary Michael Moore said it was a great strength of the UK that we provided the same level of help to those who needed it regardless of which part of the UK they live in. He also said it highlighted the fact that the Scottish Government's numbers ""don't stack up"" when they propose that oil and gas revenues will pay for the costs of separating Scotland from the rest of the UK.

Figures from the Scottish Government show that identifiable spending on welfare and pensions by the UK Government in Scotland was just over £15bn in 2010 while oil revenues totalled £6.4bn. In fact, the figures show that pensions spending alone in Scotland in 2010 of £7.2bn could not be covered by oil and gas revenue.

Scotland Office analysis of the spending and revenue figures from the Scottish Government show that, since records began in 2002, defined UK spending on pensions and welfare in Scotland exceeds the total revenue from oil and gas over that period by more than £38bn.

The UK Government has spent £98.1bn on pensions and welfare since 2002 while the total revenue from oil and gas was £59.7bn. The analysis shows that in no year has oil revenue covered the welfare bill - even in 2009 when North Sea revenue reached almost £13bn.

The Scottish Secretary Michael Moore said:

""Oil and gas is a vital sector for the Scottish economy but these numbers put things in some perspective.

""Pensions and welfare spending is crucially important to people in Scotland and the UK.

""The great strength for us within the UK is that we get a common level of provision for welfare and pensions. It doesn¿t matter whether you're in Cornwall or the far North of Scotland, you are given the same support.

""The scale of the UK means we can better withstand economic shocks in certain parts of the country and look after those who need help.

""If revenues from oil and gas revenue decline significantly - as they can - we have got the bigger resources of the UK to keep welfare and pensions payments going.

""This highlights yet again the fundamental questions the Scottish Government must answer about how you deal with the costs of separating Scotland from the rest of the UK. Oil and gas revenues are offered up as the solution but the number don't stack up.""

"Michael Moore today welcomed the news that 39 Engineer Regiment will move to Kinloss next summer.  This move will bring 930 service personnel and their families to Moray, as the RAF continue their drawdown at the site.  He said:

""Today's announcement is excellent news for Moray, bringing a large, highly-skilled unit to the area.  We have listened carefully to the community's concerns about the impact of a gap between the drawdown of the RAF from the base and arrival of the Army. 

""This move will take place a great deal earlier than expected.  This is a demonstration of our good faith and commitment to ensure that changes in Moray - and throughout Scotland - take place with the minimum of disruption. 

""I pay tribute to the RAF, Army and Defence Infrastructure Organisation who are working enormously hard to implement moves smoothly.  The Armed Forces have a great deal of experience of these sorts of moves and I know that they will carry them out with the utmost professionalism. 

""I am confident that this expertise combined with the strong working relationships with communities in Scotland mean that this programme will be implemented very successfully.""

Jim Royan, Chairman of the Moray Economic Partnership said:

""The RAF has been at the heart of our Kinloss community for 70 years and we wish those who are leaving the very best.  But we are delighted to welcome the men and women of 39 Engineers who are coming to Moray and they will find a warm welcome at their new home.

""We appreciate the great efforts that are being made to secure a seamless transition.  The well-established partnership effort in Moray has already built a friendly working relationship with the Army.  We will continue to work collaboratively with the Armed Forces and the Government to make the changes a success for Moray.""

The announcement also set out how the Army intends to restructure its regional Divisions and Brigades, including the disbandment of 2nd Division with transfer of many of its responsibilities to 51 (Scottish) Brigade. 

The Army will retain a General Officer Commanding (Scotland), maintaining senior representation in Scotland to oversee basing changes.  It was also confirmed that the Army intends to relocate HQ 1st Division, currently based in Germany, to Scotland by 2020 which would take over the GOC Scotland role. 

The Secretary of State said:

""The MOD Basing Review announced earlier this year enhanced Scotland¿s defence footprint, retaining key bases and more than doubling the size of the Army.  Retention of a 2-star general here further underlines our commitment to a firm defence presence in Scotland.""

"The Secretary of State for Scotland, Michael Moore, will today welcomed the route for the Olympic torch in Scotland. The iconic torch will pass through every Local Authority and over 120 villages, towns, and cities in Scotland between 8 and 14 June 2012.

An average of 115 Torchbearers will carry the torch each day. They have been nominated for their personal achievement or contribution to their community and the successful nominees will be notified next month. There will be a community celebration each evening when the torch reaches its destination. It will be  placed in a caldron each night to allow as many people as possible to see it.

The torch will travel by plane to Orkney and the Shetland islands and at other times it will be transported by car, train and bikes when it is not being carried on foot. Over 95% of the UK population will be within just 10 miles of the Olympic Flame next summer.

The Secretary of State for Scotland said:

""I look forward to welcoming the Olympic torch to Scotland for the first time. The Olympic Organising Committee, LOCOG, have worked extremely hard to ensure that most people in Scotland will have the opportunity to join the Olympic celebrations. I encourage schools and Local Authorities to come together to create a unique local celebration when the torch passes through their town.

"A new TNS-BRMB Poll for the BBC Politics Show published today today shows nearly three quarters of people in both Scotland and the whole UK do not want to see Scotland separate from the rest of the UK.

Scottish Secretary Michael Moore said this is the latest confirmation that Scots do not want to break away from the UK and that is why the First Minister will not hold a straightforward referendum on Scotland's future in the UK. The two-question ballot proposed by the Scottish Government was recently branded ""unfeasible"" by one of the world's foremost experts on constitutional referendums.

The poll shows support for breaking up the UK at 28 per cent, down since the last TNS-BRMB poll published by the Herald on 5 September. It means independence is the least favoured of all options put to the public, which also included further powers for the Scottish Parliament or maintaining the status quo.

The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore said:

""This is simply the latest confirmation that Scots don't want to break away from the UK and that is why the First Minister can't hold a referendum now and wants to find lots of questions to ask in a few years time.

""The Scottish Government tactic of evading the difficult questions is clearly faltering, especially since support has dropped since they launched their independence campaign.

""The positive reasons to stay in the UK are absolutely clear, from being part of one of the world¿s foremost and most stable economies to having Westminster spend over £20 billion over and above the Scottish budget in Scotland each year. The choice between the two is obvious and Scots are making it.

""After another week in which business leaders highlighted the damaging effect of uncertainty on business decisions, the Scottish Government must get on with the referendum and focus on the economy and jobs.""

"The life sciences and biopharma sectors are important growth areas for Scotland's economy and essential for the health of both our economy and population, the Secretary of State for Scotland said today.

Visiting the biopharmaceutical company Quintiles in West Lothian today, the Minister said it was the mixture of expertise, skills and access to finance within a stable economy that made investing in the UK an attractive prospect for global companies as well as start-ups and spin-out firms.

He pointed to the fact universities and research institutes across the country help put the UK at the forefront of the worldwide pharmaceutical industry. It employs around 72,000 people in the UK, of which around 26,000 work in research and development.

Michael Moore said:

""Bioscience  is an important and growing industry and Scotland benefits directly from the links and collaborations which are possible by working across the whole of the UK. That spans research as well as manufacturing bases which not only support thousands of jobs but are constantly finding and delivering new drugs, technologies and cures to fight diseases.

""Having a global company like Quintiles continuing to invest in Scotland shows the growing range of opportunities which the UK continues to offer. The company is a prime example of making the most of those possibilities and itself has units and labs across the country, including in Guys Hospital in London.

""That stability is clearly a major factor in securing the future of this industry and I want to see it continue. The UK Government will continue to support the sector and is also set to open a cell therapy centre through the UK Technology Strategy Board.""

The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore MP said: ""The PILOT Share Fair is a key date in the oil and gas industry calendar. The industry is absolutely vital for Scotland and an event such as this which allows companies investing billions in the North Sea to explain their plans to the innovative companies in the Scottish supply chain is incredibly useful. We know the sector faces a number of significant opportunities and the UK Government will continue to work closely with the oil and gas industry in future.""

"A Citigroup investment report published this week has made clear the strength of the United Kingdom is key to the Scottish Government's renewables ambitions, the Secretary of State for Scotland said today.

The report  raised doubts on the compatibility of independence and the renewables policies and raised concerns that a separate Scotland's consumer base would be far too small to support the required level of subsidy to develop and maintain the sector.  
 

The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore said: ""The Citigroup report is a perfect example of the referendum uncertainty that we have long warned about. 

""It is vital that we maximise the potential of the renewables sector by providing the stable environment in which that can happen.   
""The Scottish Government must end the uncertainty and confusion cause by the delay over the referendum and it should bring forward their proposals now.

""Scotland's renewables sector has enormous potential, and we are determined that Scotland will feel the full benefit of it, but the report makes absolutely clear that it is only the size and scale of UK investment and its consumer base that will make that happen.

""So Scotland's green energy future will not come about despite the UK; it will come about because of the UK. This is a perfect partnership for Scotland's green energy future and a further example of why we are stronger together, and poorer apart.""

"The full response document can be read [here](/scotlandoffice/files/20040 Cm 8326.pdf).

The UK Government's referendum consultation has produced overwhelming support for the Scottish people being asked a single, clear question on whether Scotland should become independent.

A broad coalition of members of the public, businesses and academics formed part of a 75 per cent response in favour of a single question.  The UK and Scottish Governments and all main political parties have already expressed a preference for a single question referendum. 

Scottish Secretary Michael Moore said: ""If all the political parties and the vast majority of respondents to our consultation agree that they would prefer a single question referendum then we must be able to agree that it will be a single question referendum.""

The UK Government today published a 26 page document summarising the 2857 responses to the consultation and setting out the level of support for the Government's proposals on how to facilitate a legal, fair and decisive referendum. 

The consultation responses revealed strong support for the following:

- 63% of those who support giving the Scottish Parliament the power to legislate for a referendum support the use of a Section 30 order.

-  70% of respondents agreed with the UK Government that the referendum should take place sooner rather than later, including a large number of businesses based in Scotland:

- 75% of respondents agreed with the UK Government that there should be a single question on Scotland's constitutional status.

- 86% of respondents to this section of the consultation paper agreed with the UK Government that the Electoral Commission should have a role in overseeing an independence referendum.   
   
-  71% of respondents expressed the view that those resident in Scotland should be entitled to vote in a referendum.  This shows a clear majority in support of the UK Government's  preference that the devolved legislature and local government franchise would be most suitable

- People gave reasons both of principle and practice for supporting a single question referendum:

Principle

- Independence and devolution are separate issues and should not be confused.

-  The Scottish Government was elected on a manifesto commitment to hold a referendum on independence.

Practice

- There is no agreement on what a second referendum question would be about.

- There would be an unclear and disputed outcome if a 2nd question received more support than independence but independence was pronounced the winner.  

Today's report also sets out the UK Government's own response to the consultation and explains how the Government plans  to proceed in light of the findings of the consultation.

Scottish Secretary Michael Moore said:

""I am grateful for the level and quality of the responses we have received to our consultation on the referendum.  I am also pleased that the proposals I set out in January to deliver a legal, fair and decisive referendum have been strongly endorsed. Putting the independence referendum on a sound legal footing was at the heart our proposals and there is strong support in the consultation for the UK and Scottish Governments agreeing an order to provide Holyrood with the legal power to hold the referendum.

""The consultation has also produced a resounding endorsement for the referendum having a single, clear question on independence.  The reasons given are compelling. The Scottish Government was elected on a manifesto commitment to hold an independence referendum. It is not at all clear what a second question would be about. There must be a clear and decisive outcome to this referendum and a multi-option referendum will confuse matters.

""The quality of the argument is also backed up by quantity. The individuals and organisations who are supporting this option have added their voice to the many already supporting a single question. We are now in the position where a single, clear question is the preference of the UK Government, the Scottish Government, the main political parties in Scotland and three-quarters of those responding to the consultation.

""If all the political parties and the vast majority of respondents to our consultation agree that they would prefer a single question referendum then we must be able to agree that it will be a single question referendum.

""There is very strong support in Scotland for getting on with this referendum sooner rather than later. In particular, it is clear that business feel the uncertainty is damaging and this is something we cannot ignore.

""It is important that the two governments can reach agreement on these matters so that we can move on to the real debate about whether Scotland's future should be as part of the United Kingdom or as a separate country outside of the UK.""

"Michael Moore today visited the  Glen Ord distillery in Ross-shire to welcome the £3.2million investment by Diageo which has seen the site's  capacity increased by around a million litres per annum (mla), to 5.2mla, to help meet the growing export demand for whisky in Asia particularly.

The Singleton of Glen Ord malt whisky brand is the fastest growing single malt in the Asia-Pacific market region, according to the most recent data from IWSR (International Wine and Spirits Research). Its volume sales grew by 40% in 2010, breaking through the 100,000 case barrier (9 litre cases).

Announcing the successful completion of the distillery expansion, Mr Moore said:

""Whisky exports are good news for Scotland and I congratulate Diageo on its success. The expansion of the Glen Ord distillery shows the confidence behind one of Scotland's flagship industries. It will help further secure whisky's important place in the Scottish economy and its global brand, as well as securing and creating jobs.

""The UK Government has worked hard to help the industry in its export efforts by securing geographical indication status for Scotch whisky products in key markets around the world and continues to do so.

"Scottish companies can play an essential role in helping young people into the job market by signing up to the UK Government's Youth Contract which comes into effect today (Monday 2 April).

Scottish Secretary Michael Moore called on more Scottish firms to sign up to the initiative as he began a series of visits across Scotland.

The Minister visited two companies in Caithness - Reids Bakery and Icetech  Freezers Ltd - which both gave their backing to the Youth Contract today.

The UK Government's £1 billion Youth Contract will provide nearly 500,000 new opportunities for 18-24 years olds across the UK, including apprenticeships and work experience placements.

It marks a substantial increase in the support and help available to young people through the Work Programme and Jobcentre Plus. Many businesses have already offered support by committing opportunities and vacancies for young people without jobs.  
The UK Government is working with over 200 large national employers in the country and hundreds of thousands of small and medium sized employers to help give young people the opportunity to gain skills and experience and to find work.

Measures include:

- 160,000 wage incentives of up to £2,275 for employers to recruits 18-24 year olds from the Work Programme.  
- 250,000 extra work experience placements over the next three years, providing at least 100,000 places per year.

The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore said: ""I was glad to see two more companies in Caithness sign up to the Youth Contract as it launches today and I would encourage companies across Scotland to do the same.

""The UK Government is committed to getting young people into work and we have been working hard in Scotland to tackle the issue. The Youth Contract will help young people in Scotland - it will provide support for them through Jobcentre Plus and through work experience and it will help employers looking to recruit 18-24 year olds with wage incentives.

""Today's launch is a significant step towards creating more opportunities for young people. Earlier this month, I chaired Scotland¿s first National Convention on Youth Employment which brought together the Scottish Government, employment and skills organisations and a wide range of other bodies to find ways to remove barriers facing young people looking for work. We will continue to build on that strong base and the Youth Contract will provide major support for those efforts.""

"The Budget will mean that 162,000 lower paid Scots no longer have to pay income tax, Scottish Secretary Michael Moore said today. He also highlighted the importance of the Budget for Scottish jobs and investment.

Mr Moore said key sectors of the Scottish economy such as oil and gas and the games industry have been targeted for specific support in the Budget while a further cut in Corporation tax will help all businesses in Scotland.

The Scottish Secretary also highlighted that since the 2010 Spending Review the Scottish Government have now received more than £1 billion in extra revenue from Barnett consequentials, of which £730m is for extra Capital spending. In the coming financial year, 2012-13, the Scottish Government will receive £336.3m more than originally allocated in the 2010 Spending Review.

Budget 2012 measures which will help Scotland include:

* An increase in Personal Allowance by a further £1,100 in April 2013 will remove a further 73,000 Scots from tax and benefit 2.1m Scots. This means that more than 160,000 Scots have now been removed from the tax system under this Government.  
* Raising the individual threshold for the withdrawal of child benefit to £50,000 will benefit 63,000 households in Scotland.

* A package of oil and gas measures that will stimulate billions of pounds of additional investment and increase production in the UK Continental Shelf.  
* The Government will introduce corporation tax reliefs for the video game industry from April 2013.

* Corporation tax is being cut by an additional 1 per cent to 24% in 2012 and will be cut to 22% by 2014. Corporation Tax stood at 28% when this Government came to office.  
* The National Loan Guarantee Scheme announced yesterday will help smaller businesses in Scottish receive cheaper loans.  
* The Government will make 100% capital allowances for plant or machinery investment from April 2012 at agreed sites at Irvine, Nigg and Dundee.

* There are Barnett consequentials in this Budget of £20.3m  
* Total Barnett consequentials since the 2010 Spending Review now exceed £1bn. This is £730.3m in Capital DEL and £367.2m in Resource DEL.  
* The total additional Barnett consequentials for 2012-13 since the Spending Review are £336.3m

The Scottish Secretary Michael Moore said:

""The Government has used this Budget to provide greater fairness for individuals and  to help Scottish businesses.  This is a Budget that will create more jobs in Scotland and it will help those who are already in jobs.

""We are committed to taking lower paid Scots out of the tax system altogether. The increase in personal allowances is the biggest rise in the last thirty years and will mean that a further 73,000 people in Scotland will not pay income tax.

""Key Scottish industries like the oil and gas sector and the games industry will benefit from specifically targeted measures in this Budget. We are also supporting Scottish business as a whole with another reduction in Corporation Tax to 24%. We have reached our original target for the Parliament and set out our ambitious new target to help Scottish business with further reductions to 22%.

""I am also pleased that we are able to offer tax help to the games industry in Scotland. Places like Dundee and Edinburgh will benefit from this move and I believe it can provide a real boost for this important industry.

""This Budget ensures the continuing stability of the UK economy while providing real help to people and business in Scotland. Scotland benefits from being part of a strong United Kingdom on the one hand and at the same time being able to take devolved decisions in Edinburgh. Since the Spending Review 18 months ago the Government has now allocated £1 billion in extra resources for the Scottish Government to spend. Nearly three-quarters of that money was for capital projects.

""Devolution provides the best of both worlds for Scotland and this Budget provides real help for people and business in Scotland.""

"The Scotland Bill is set to bring major new powers to the Scottish Parliament after the UK Government and Scottish Government reached agreement on the provisions of the Bill, the Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore announced today (Wednesday 21 March).

The Scottish Secretary today set out in a Written Ministerial Statement to the House of Commons the measures agreed with the Scottish Government on the tax powers, borrowing powers and non-finance elements of the Scotland Bill.

Among the measures announced by Mr Moore are:

* The UK and Scottish Governments have the intention of reaching agreement on all implementation issues.  
* Borrowing limits will be reviewed regularly ahead of Spending Reviews.  
* The Government will shortly launch a consultation on the Scottish Government being able to issue its own bonds.  
* A certification requirement will not be introduced on appeals to the UK Supreme Court from Scottish criminal cases  but there will be a review of the new arrangements after three years of operation.

The Scottish Government will today  table a Legislative Consent  Memorandum which recommends the Scottish Parliament votes in support of the Bill when the Legislative Consent Motion is put before Holyrood.  The Scottish Secretary has always said he wanted the Scottish Parliament  to give their support for the largest ever transfer of powers from London to Holyrood.

If the Scotland Bill receives the support of both the UK and Scottish Parliaments over the coming weeks it will bring about the biggest transfer of fiscal power since the creation of the UK and includes:

* a new Scottish rate of income tax  
* the devolution of stamp duty land tax   
* the devolution of landfill tax  
* the power to create new taxes  
* new borrowing powers

This will bring a much higher level of financial accountability to Holyrood as MSPs become responsible for raising more of the money they spend.

The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore said:

""Today marks a major step forward for devolution and I am glad Scotland's two governments have reached agreement over the Scotland Bill. The UK Government has been clear from the outset we believe it is the right package of new powers for Scotland. We have also been clear that we wanted the Scottish Parliament to support the measures contained in the Scotland Bill. It will strengthen devolution and the cross-government support for the Bill is good news for Scotland.

""There has been a great deal of debate around the Bill and we have worked closely and flexibly with the Scottish Government to make the changes required to secure an agreement. The Bill also remains faithful to the work of the Calman Commission which received such overwhelming support at the last General Election.""

The Secretary of State for Scotland (Michael Moore):  The Scotland Bill is a significant step forward in Scottish devolution.  It provides for the biggest transfer of fiscal power from London since the creation of the United Kingdom - including a new Scottish rate of income tax, full devolution of stamp duty land tax and landfill tax, and new borrowing powers.  Together, the OBR forecast that these measures will enable the Scottish Government to raise between £5bn and £6bn of its budget in addition to around £4bn it currently raises in council tax and non-domestic rates.

Since its introduction in November 2010, the Bill has had detailed scrutiny in the UK and Scottish Parliaments.  In Westminster, it has passed successfully through its Commons stages and will soon complete Lords Committee consideration.  In Holyrood, the Scottish Parliament voted overwhelmingly in support of the Bill last March.

After productive discussions with the Scottish Government in recent weeks, the Government is today announcing a package of measures in the Bill and supporting non-legislative arrangements to show that the powers will operate in a fair and sustainable way to the benefit of Scotland and the rest of the UK.

Agreement has been reached with the Scottish Government on both the finance and non-finance provisions included in the Bill and the Scottish Government will today table a Legislative Consent Memorandum recommending that the Scottish Parliament votes in support of the Bill on a further Legislative Consent Motion for the Bill.

Today's announcement provides more detail about the operation of the new tax and borrowing powers and about the non-finance elements of the Scotland Bill.  The Government is committed to: 

* The Government will ensure that changes in the Scottish Government¿s budget are closely linked to the performance of its economy by adjusting Scotland¿s budget to reflect new tax powers using the model recommended to the Welsh Assembly in the Holtham Report.  This approach, agreed with the Scottish Finance Minister and the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, will help protect the Scottish Government¿s budget from wider macro-economic shocks. 

* The Government will work together with the Scottish Government over coming months and years to give operational effect to the powers including the block grant adjustment, in a fair and sustainable way with the intention of reaching agreement on all implementation issues.

* The Scotland Bill will be amended to require the Secretary of State for Scotland and Scottish Ministers to produce annual reports to the UK and Scottish Parliaments on the progress of transferring the tax and borrowing powers to the Scottish Government.

* In line with long-standing principles of devolved funding, the Scottish Government will pay for its new income tax system of administration.  The Government will explore the scope to offset some of the savings from HMRC ceasing its administration of stamp duty land tax and landfill tax.

* Borrowing limits will be reviewed regularly ahead of Spending Reviews through the Joint Exchequer Committee.

* The Scottish Government will be given access to loans over a longer period in principle, subject to the ability to repay and the type of asset.

* The Government will shortly launch a consultation on the Scottish Government issuing its own bonds.

* Aggregates Levy will be devolved once the legal challenges in the European and UK courts have been fully resolved.  
* The Government is open to considering what further powers might be devolved  after a referendum on independence.

* The clauses reserving the regulation of health professions and insolvency will be removed, following assurances from the Scottish Government that they will work closely with the Government to ensure consistent regulatory regimes apply to health professions and that insolvency procedures are kept up to date and operate effectively throughout the UK.

* The clause allowing partial referral of Acts of the Scottish Parliament to the Supreme Court will be removed at the request of the Scottish Government.  This means in the future - as at present - a full Act could be referred to the Supreme Court, even if only a single provision raised competence issues.

* The clause on implementing international obligations will be removed following assurances from the Scottish Government that they will work closely with the Government to ensure that the UK continues at all times to implement its international obligations.  If there is a failure to implement any international obligation the UK Government may use its powers under s.58 (2) of the Scotland Act to direct Scottish Ministers.

* Additional amendments will be made to the provisions on appeals to the Supreme Court from Scottish criminal cases.  A certification requirement will not be introduced.  However, the new arrangements will be subject to a review, chaired by the Lord Justice General of Scotland, after three years of operation.  Certification will be included within the scope of the review, and it will be possible for changes to be made to the arrangements by subordinate legislation following the review.

These announcements today meet the tests the Government has set for changes to the Bill package - they are based on evidence, maintain the cross-party consensus which supports the Bill, and will benefit Scotland without detriment to the rest of the UK.

The Scotland Bill was introduced in November 2010 and has had detailed scrutiny in the UK and Scottish Parliaments. At Westminster it has passed successfully through its Commons stages and will soon complete Lords Committee consideration. At Holyrood, the Scottish Parliament voted overwhelmingly in support of the Bill last March.  It was also the subject of scrutiny by the Scottish Parliament Scotland Bill Committee.

"Scotland needs its two governments and employers to work together to create work opportunities for young people across Scotland, the Secretary of State Michael Moore said today.

He highlighted three initiatives to help boost youth employment at the first National Convention on the issue at Dundee College today (Thursday 15 March).

The event was attended by around 300 delegates from both public and private sector organisations, including Jobcentre Plus.

The Minister was joined by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Iain Duncan Smith and the Scottish Government Ministers John Swinney and Angela Constance in Dundee.

The event is a culmination of several months of engagement across Scotland, during which the Secretary of State has met hundreds of young people, employers and stakeholders throughout the employment sector.

Moore told the audience agreement had been reached between the Department of Work and Pensions and ScotRail to offer unemployed people in Scotland a discount of 50% on rail travel throughout Scotland.

This will be available at the discretion of  Jobcentre Plus advisers from 13 weeks of registered unemployment, and will be introduced to Jobcentres from early April.

He also said the UK Government's Youth Contract announcement included an extra 250,000 Work Experience or sector-based work academy places over the next three years.   This will take the total to at least 100,000 a year Work Experience opportunities across Great Britain.

The Minister said over 2,000 young people have started on Work Experience in Scotland and announced a challenge to the assembled employers to provide a further 500 Work Experience placements. 

He added that the Youth Contract announcement also included 160,000 wage incentives over three years worth £2,275 each, for employers who employ an 18-24 year-old from the Work Programme.

The Youth Contract goes live in April and the Minister  used the convention to promote wage incentives to employers in the audience. He also announced a future programme of employer engagement around Scotland to encourage the recruitment of Work Programme participants and take-up of wage incentives.

Moore told the convention:

""I think it is of particular importance that the UK Government and the Scottish Government - the two governments of Scotland - work together on this critical issue.

""The purpose of today is to bring the key players in the youth employment debate on a focused basis.

""Youth unemployment is a problem which can appear to have more questions than answers but we can achieve far more together than apart.

""We need to ensure that efforts across all of our responsibilities connect. It is easy to work in isolation but with stretched resources we must work smarter, harder and together.

""Employers are the lynch pin in any employment policy.  It is very clear that we need to ensure Scottish employers know what help is available to them and crucially that any available help is appropriate to the needs of Scottish business. 

""Today we are promoting the availability of work incentives to employers.  From April, under the Youth Contract, Scottish employers will be able to access up to £2,275 wage incentive for each 18-24 year-old they employ for at least 26 weeks from the Work Programme.

""Following today's event I will be embarking on a series of events around Scotland to spread the word and encourage employers to take advantage of this incentive.

""The provision of bona fide long term jobs is our prime goal.  However, we know from our discussions with young people, that short term Work Experience is a vital component that can make all the difference to a young persons CV as they continue their journey towards work. 

""The Government Work Experience programme has created over two thousand placements in Scotland since last April. As a direct outcome of today's event I would like to ask employers to help me create a further 500 Work Experience placements.""

"ScotRail, the primary rail operator in Scotland, has agreed to introduce the Jobcentre Plus Travel Discount card onto its network from 1 April 2012. Eligible Jobcentre Plus claimants will be able to obtain a 50% discount on rail travel on ScotRail services within Scotland.

ScotRail will adopt the Association of Train Operating Companies (ATOC) eligibility rules. In addition, as a result of ScotRail's more generous funding agreement, claimants in Scotland will be able to access discounts earlier - after three months unemployment - and will be able to retain the card when participating in the Work Programme.  Claimants in England and Wales have to wait six months before becoming eligible.

These concessions from the standard scheme give significant extra help to jobseekers in Scotland.

The formal Memorandum of Understanding between Scotrail and Jobcentre Plus was signed at Dundee railway station, prior to the National Convention on Youth Employment in Dundee on 15 March 2012.

Jobcentre Plus provides the administration and funding of the cards and application forms. The card is issued to claimants at advisers' discretion to support return to work, job interviews and training.

Steve Montgomery, the managing director of ScotRail said: "" We are happy to support this initiative because it reduces the financial burden on people who are looking for work.""

The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore said: ""This is an excellent and generous ScotRail initiative which will give practical support to those looking for work. We need to do all we can to help people into employment and discounted rail travel will  make it easier to attend interviews and seek out opportunities.""

Richard Cornish, DWP Work Services Director in Scotland, said: ""I'm delighted we've reached this agreement between Jobcentre Plus in Scotland and Scotrail which will enable claimants in Scotland to widen their jobsearch by reducing the cost of rail travel.""

The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore said:

""These figures reflect the challenging economic climate. They are a strong reminder that getting people into work is our first priority, especially as the Scottish unemployment rate remains above the rest of the UK.

""We are doing all we can to get Scotland working. The UK Government is laying the foundations for more sustainable growth in Scotland and creating the conditions for businesses to invest in good quality jobs.

""Our primary goal is to get young people into employment and tomorrow I will chair the first National Convention on Youth Employment in Dundee. We will bring together Ministers from both the UK and Scottish Governments with public and private sector organisations to work together for the benefit of our young people in Scotland.

""We also want to support our unemployed young people and this is why the Government is introducing a Youth Contract worth almost £1bn over the Spending Review Period.

""Scotland has also benefited from nation-wide investments in high quality infrastructure to the tune of over £430 million pounds which will help Scotland remain competitive.""

"The UK Government today announced that Perth has become one of the UK's new cities after being awarded formal city status as part of the Diamond Jubilee Civic Honours competition.

Perth, already known as the ""fair city"" locally, made a successful bid and has received the honour as part of a process marking Her Majesty The Queen's 60 years on the British throne.

Welcoming the news, the Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore said:

""Today's announcement of its city status is great news for the people who live there, for Perthshire and for Scotland as a whole.

"UK Government Ministers will be in Perth on Tuesday for a National Convention which aims to put the Big Society at the heart of Scottish life.

The Scotland Office Minister David Mundell and Nick Hurd, the UK Government's Minister for Civil Society, will be at the Dewar's Centre for a Big Society National Roundtable event. It will bring government and representatives from public and voluntary sector organisations, charities and social enterprises together to discuss ways to deliver a stronger Scottish society.

The national roundtable is the culmination of a series of visits around Scotland, including Edinburgh, Glasgow, Peterhead, Cumbernauld, Girvan, which David Mundell used to discuss the benefits of community empowerment.

Delegates in Perth will also hear about the opportunities Big Society Capital - the financial institution which supports organisations that invest in the social sector - may present for further investment in social enterprises, charities, voluntary and community organisations in Scotland. A representative of Big Society Capital will speak at the event.

Speaking ahead of the conference, David Mundell said:

""I support and admire what so many public-spirited Scots are doing in their communities. I have seen and hear about projects and enterprises which are prospering on the Big Society's three pillar of community empowerment, reforming our public services and encouraging greater social action.

""Government can help enable and encourage the long-standing tradition of community engagement in Scotland - but ultimately this is about people, about communities and about working for the good of both ourselves and those around us.

""It is fitting that we are meeting in Perth, the very heart of Scotland. That is where the values of the Big Society must sit and I am looking forward to speaking  to the varied organisations who are helping to deliver a stronger society in Scotland.""

"The Business Secretary Vince Cable announced today (8 March) that the first ever UK Green Investment Bank (GIB) will be based in Edinburgh and London.

The headquarters of the GIB will be located in Edinburgh, with the GIB's main transaction team based in London. This arrangement will enable a greater commercial reach nationally than could be achieved from one location.

Sitting the bank across these two locations will enable the GIB to become a world leader, playing to the strengths of Edinburgh and London.

Business Secretary Vince Cable said: ""Harnessing the strengths of Edinburgh and London will support the Green Investment Bank's ambition to become a world leader. Edinburgh has a thriving green sector and respected expertise in areas such as asset management. London, as the world's leading financial centre, will ensure that the GIB's transaction team can hit the ground running.

""This decision will allow the GIB to operate effectively and achieve its mission of mobilising the additional investment needed to accelerate the UK's transition to a green economy.""

Scottish Secretary Michael Moore welcomed the news, commenting: ""I am delighted that the Green Investment Bank will be headquartered in Edinburgh. Scotland has enormous green energy potential and its capital is the UK's second biggest financial centre. 

""The size and scale of the UK's single energy market ensures the level of investment that will unlock Scotland's renewables future, providing sustainable and affordable green energy across the UK.  It makes perfect sense to have a GIB presence there.

""By basing the GIB's corporate HQ, asset management and administrative functions in Edinburgh and its transaction team in London, we can harness expertise across the country to deliver a strong and successful GIB for the UK.""

The next step for the GIB is the recruitment of the Chair and Senior Independent Director so that it will be in a position to be fully operational this Autumn, subject to state aid approval for the GIB. The GIB is expected to employ 50-70 full time equivalent staff across the two sites.

An assessment of the applications from 32 locations across the UK found that Edinburgh and London were the two leading candidates. The decision document, together with all the submissions from the 32 locations that put in a bid to host the Green Investment Bank (GIB), can be found at [www.bis.gov.uk/giblocation](http://www.bis.gov.uk/giblocation)

The criteria for deciding on a location said that it should:

- be able to recruit and retain the specialist staff needed to run the organisation;   
- enable the GIB to work closely with other parties involved in deals as well as other investment bodies, project developers and green technology providers, and;    
- ensure that the GIB is cost effective.

-The GIB is designed to accelerate private sector investment in the UK's transition to a green economy. Offshore wind power generation, commercial and industrial waste processing and recycling, energy from waste generation, non-domestic energy efficiency and support for the Green Deal will be the first priority sectors for the GIB, subject to approval by the European Commission.

- The Government is committed to setting the UK firmly on course towards a green and growing economy. The transition to a green economy presents significant growth opportunities for UK-based businesses, both at home and abroad. This progression requires unprecedented investment in key green sectors. An estimated investment of up to £200 billion in the energy system alone is needed over the period to 2020. The GIB will be uniquely placed to facilitate the transition to a green economy base by addressing the market failures affecting green infrastructure projects.  These failures have led to significant under investment in the key areas required to deliver this transition. Capitalised with £3 billion, the GIB will complement other green policies to help accelerate additional capital in green infrastructure.

"Commenting on the Scottish Government's publication of the Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland 2010-2011 (GERS) figures today, the Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore said:

""The figures once again show there are great benefits to being part of the United Kingdom. You only have to look at the £15.5 billion which the UK Government spent on social protection and welfare last year as an example of the security of spending the people of Scotland rely on. That figure is worth double the oil and gas revenue alone.

""It is also encouraging to see revenues rising once again after a couple of very difficult years.

""Scotland is an integral part of the UK and also benefits from the UK-wide spending on the wider economy - including the essential stabilisation of the banking system, deficit reduction, quantitative easing and other projects led by the UK Government.

""There is little point in the Scottish Government saying Scotland's finances are stronger than the UK's - that relies on a number of omissions and fails to take account of the interwoven nature of the UK's spending. Scotland is thankfully not separate from the UK's public sector spending and it is up to those seeking independence to explain what the benefits of leaving a system which equally shares risk and reward would be.

""They must also explain what Scotland's net fiscal deficit, even including the oil and gas revenues, would mean for much-vaunted policies such as an oil fund.  It seems obvious to say that you cannot create an oil fund from money which does not exist.""

"The Edinburgh-headquartered Mercy Corps was today confirmed by the UK Government's International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell as one of the top organisations specialising in disaster response to be selected for a new UK rapid response network. It means the charity will be among those able to respond quicker as part of the UK Government's response to major crises across the world.

The network, called the Rapid Response Facility, will mobilise life saving support in the critical hours following a humanitarian disaster, improving the UK's response to major international crises, such as famine, floods and earthquakes.

Following a disaster, equipment, experts and vital aid are too often tied up with paperwork, rather than being immediately deployed, International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell said.

The new system allows the UK's top organisations with extensive experience in disaster response to access funding within hours, thereby reaching affected people faster and saving more lives.

Mercy Corps' teams of experts have decades of experience responding to humanitarian emergencies. The organisation helped more than 1.5 million people survive the drought and famine that hit the Horn of Africa last year. Teams in Somalia, Kenya and Ethiopia responded with a whole range of assistance, including clean water for almost 500,000 people, food and treatment for 42,000 malnourished children and emergency cash to allow 26,000 families to buy the essentials they needed to survive.

The new facility will have a game-changing impact on Mercy Corps' ability to deliver aid in the critical hours and days after a disaster, said Executive Director Mervyn Lee. It will enable the organisations' experts to get life-saving help to affected communities faster, and focus on aid delivery rather than paperwork and sourcing funding.

The new Rapid Response Facility will be activated in the event of a future large scale humanitarian crisis. Mercy Corps along with the other UK charities and businesses selected will be approached within hours, enabling them to get aid to affected people in the critical first 72 hours following a disaster.

UK International Development Secretary, Andrew Mitchell said:

""Mercy Corps is one of the very best performing disaster response agencies and plays a critical role in the UK's life-saving work to help people struck by disaster.  The UK is a world leader in this field and I'm glad Mercy Corps is part of this crucial next step with the UK government. 

""We need our best experts, equipment and aid on the ground as quickly as possible after a disaster, not tied up in red tape.  They need to be able to do their job in that vital window of 72 hours, to save as many lives as possible.

Mervyn Lee, Executive Director of Mercy Corps' European Headquarters in Edinburgh said:

""We know from years of experience that acting quickly saves lives and every day counts. The Rapid Response Facility will help us get essentials like clean water, emergency supplies and health treatment to those who need them within days rather than weeks. And by being on the ground from the very beginning we can help communities not only survive the immediate crisis they face, but to recover and have the chance to rebuild their lives for the long term too.""

"The UK Government will scrap Stamp Duty in Scotland in 2015 and allow Holyrood to design a completely new set of property taxes and collection process, Scottish Secretary Michael Moore said today.   
   
Mr Moore said with the Scottish Government indicating they will use the new Scotland Bill powers to depart significantly from the current UK Stamp Duty system, he urged them to set out their plans long before the switch off in April 2015 in order to ensure there were no late surprises for Scottish home buyers and builders.   
   
The Scottish Secretary said starting from scratch with a new set of Scottish property taxes was one of the opportunities afforded by enhanced devolution but it also brought a responsibility to ensure the new system was fair as well as providing the revenue stream the devolved Government required.     
   
The Scotland Bill, currently going through the UK Parliament, transfers control over Stamp Duty Land Tax to Holyrood.  Revenue raised from this tax will remain in Scotland for use by the Scottish Government. The Scottish Government will be able to design a brand new land tax scheme including rates and thresholds, to fit with its objectives for the Scottish property market.   
   
The Scottish Secretary today visited a housing development in Edinburgh where 111 new homes are being constructed by Hart Builders for the Port of Leith Housing Association. He discussed ways in which the new powers could be used to help home buyers and the construction sector in Scotland.

Michael Moore said:  
   
""The Scotland Bill will give the Scottish Parliament the responsibility for land tax in Scotland. The Scottish Government have idicated they will depart significantly from the UK Stamp Duty system. That is entirely up to them and it is one of the opportunities afforded by enhanced devolution.  
   
""They will want to consider, as the UK Government does at present, how best to shape the tax in order to help the likes of first time buyers, house builders, the environment and the overall economy. With a radical re-shaping expected I would urge the Scotish Government to start setting out their plans long before we switch off Stamp Duty in 2015 so that there are no late surprises for anyone.  
   
""This shouldn't be the silent hand over of tax powers at midnight in April 2015. This is a significant new power that it should be debated now so that the Scottish people and the housing sector can join in the make clear their views on how the system can change to meet their needs.

""People don't benefit from devolving powers in principle: they benefit from using them in practice. So let's start the debate on how this new power can best help people in Scotland.  
   
""New powers bring new responsibilities and Ministers at Holyrood will need to ensure the new system works effectively and that it is fair.""  
   
Stamp duty land tax (SDLT) is a charge on acquisitions of an interest in UK land, paid at a percentage of the consideration given for the acquisition.  The Scottish Government will have complete control over the design and administration of the devolved taxes on land transactions in Scotland.   Once SDLT has been ""switched off"" in Scotland, the Scottish Government may begin to charge the devolved taxes.    
   
The Scottish Government may choose to levy taxes that are similar to SDLT but may equally choose to design each tax in a way that it feels better meets Scotland's needs. The Scottish Government will not be able to levy their devolved taxes until SDLT has been disapplied. The Command Paper published alongside the Bill proposed that ""switch off"" should be in April 2015

Switching off SDLT  in Scotland will be achieved by Treasury Order.    
   
The Scottish Government has full control over the design and collection of the devolved taxes and will therefore need to decide who will collect them in the future.  Under the powers contained in the Bill, the Scottish Government will be free to enter into an arrangement with a third party to collect the devolved land transaction tax and landfill tax, or it may approach a UK Government department such as HMRC to undertake the work.   
   
HMRC estimates that, in 2009-10, 84,000 land transactions at over £40,000 (the notification threshold for SDLT) took place in Scotland.  This amounted to 8.5% of total UK transactions. SDLT receipts from Scottish transactions are estimated at £250 million in 2009-10 (5.1% of the UK total).

"The Scottish people should be allowed to sit in the referendum driving seat next year, Scotland Office Minister David Mundell said today.

Following the publication yesterday by the Government of a proper timetable to have the independence referendum next September, Mr Mundell said it was disappointing that the Scottish Government was blocking the chance for the Scottish people to have their say.

David Mundell said:

""There is no reason why the Scottish people should have to wait nearly three years to have their say in an independence referendum. We have produced a timetable that shows how you can give people their say on independence next September. No corners are cut and all processes are properly followed. But instead of working with us to put the Scottish public firmly in the referendum driving seat, the Scottish Government have resorted to insults and mistakes. This is a very poor show and people will be mystified.

""The Scottish Government claim the 2013 proposal is a 'silly  distraction'  and  'full of holes' but they don't say why and they don't say what. People want action not insults.

""The only point of substance raised by the Scottish Government is also wrong. The Electoral Commission ask for ten weeks to review the question - not test the ballot paper. They review the question while the Bill is going through Parliament, so it does not need to add an extra ten weeks to the schedule. If the ballot paper needs to be tested it can happen at the same time or even sooner. The Scottish Government need to get on top of this sort of detail very quickly rather than trying to shout down those who hold a different view from them.

""It wasn't so long ago that the Scottish Government were very enthusiastic about holding an independence referendum. There has definitely been a change in the tune coming out of St Andrew's House.  In 2009, they wanted to hold the referendum in 2010. In 2010, they wanted to hold it 'as soon as possible'. Now they want to wait for a few years to ensure 'the fullest possible debate'.  This is their fourth consultation on this subject and their third draft Bill. How much fuller can the debate be?

""Politicians and Parliaments are always having their say. It is time for the people of Scotland to decide whether Scotland should separate from the rest of the UK.""

"Scottish fashion can continue to punch above its weight on the global stage by investing in the designers of the future, Michael Moore said today.

The Minister was speaking after he visited the Scottish Academy of Fashion at the Edinburgh College of Art. He said the United Kingdom was a world leader in the industry, through globally recognised events such as London Fashion Week and access to established and emerging talent and skills across the country.

The Scottish Academy of Fashion is an ambitious project to establish Scotland as a global centre in fashion-related learning and commercially relevant research. It involves leading universities across Scotland  and aims to provide an easy way for companies to access the full range of skills available in Scottish fashion and textiles education.

He met three fashion students shortlisted for the The Johnstons of Elgin Award, a prize which rewards innovative design and aids the development of Scotland as a global centre of excellence in fashion-related learning.

The winners will receive a cash prize and an internship as well has having their winning garments displayed by the Academy in industry-focussed showcases.

The Minister met the Director of Knowledge Transfer, the Head of the School of Design and co-founder of the Academy on the visit as well as the Chair of the Scottish Textile Industry Association.

Michael Moore said:

""Scotland can already celebrate the fact we have leading lights in the fashion world, with major Scottish designers such Jonathan Saunders and Christopher Kane paving the way for others to follow. We also have companies such as Johnstons of Elgin, Harris Tweed and Pringle successfully showcasing and exporting their goods and textiles across the world.

""That is a strong creative base which we can build on in the future to ensure we continue to lead from the front in the industry. The Scottish Academy of Fashion is doing excellent work in pairing the creativity of news and upcoming designers with the commercial know-how to deliver their talents onto this incredibly important market.""

"Scottish Secretary Michael Moore has said there is no good reason why the Scottish people should have to wait nearly three years to have their say on Scotland's future.

Mr Moore today produced a referendum timetable that would meet all the legal and procedural requirements and still allow Scots to vote on independence in September 2013 - a full year earlier than the Scottish Government are currently proposing.

The Scottish Secretary said the ""go slow"" approach of the Scottish Government is unnecessary and lacks public support.

In 2009 the Scottish Government's proposed legislating for and holding the referendum in less than a year. But Mr Moore said that now that there is a real prospect of the referendum taking place, they want to ""kick the referendum can down the road"".  

Michael Moore said:

""No one has yet explained to me why the people of Scotland should have to wait nearly three years to make the most important decision we will ever make. It is not in the interests of the Scottish people to build up uncertainty and make them wait.

""The timetable I have produced today shows there is no good reason for the Scottish Government's go slow approach. We can follow all the proper procedures and parliamentary processes and still have a referendum in September 2013.

""Recent polls have certainly indicated that people think we should get on with the referendum and hold it sooner than 2014. That certainly makes sense to me.

""The Scottish Government outlined plans in 2009 where they proposed consulting, drafting a Bill, legislating and holding a referendum all within 12 months. But now, for reasons of their own, they want to kick the referendum can down the road.

""The timetable the Scottish Government have set out has heel dragging built into it. There are months and months set aside for straight forward tasks. Their consultation finishes in May and they then propose taking the whole summer to analyse responses and then the rest of the year to amend their draft Bill accordingly. That could be done properly in a much shorter time frame.

""The Scotland Bill will see us transfer the largest ever package of financial powers to the Scottish Parliament over the next four years. Powers over borrowing, income tax and property tax will all transfer to Holyrood.

""Before we  can move further powers to Edinburgh we need to know if Scotland is to remain part of the UK. That is entirely logical. We should settle the independence question as early as we can.  

""Both Governments should work through the issues we don¿t agree on and produce a referendum that is legal, fair and decisive. If we can negotiate a Section 30 Order to transfer the legal powers to Holyrood then we can give the people of Scotland their say in a referendum next year.  That's a timetable made in the interest of people in Scotland, not politicians in parliaments.""

The following sets out the Secretary of State's timetable for a 2013 referendum. It shows three ways in which to speed up the Scottish Government's timetable and allow the people of Scotland to have their say a full year earlier than the Scottish Government are proposing:

The Secretary of State for Scotland has used the UK Ministerial visit to the Vatican to discuss key issues such as international aid, human rights, poverty and climate change.

Ahead of the ministerial delegation being received by His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI today, the Minister also met a number of Cardinals and Archbishops in a series of meetings.

They discussed the work of the UK Government in delivering international aid and development was raised as a key issue and the Secretary of State underlined the commitment to helping the world¿s poorest people by becoming the first G20 country to adhere to the pledge to spend 0.7% of our gross national income on overseas assistance.

Michael Moore said:

""This visit has stressed the many areas of common interest which exist between the UK and the Holy See, particularly on important issues such as the global fight against poverty, overseas development and taking steps to combat climate change.

""We have had a very constructive exchange of views on ways we can continue to work together across social, economic and cultural issues for the wider good.""

The Minister also took part in a roundtable meeting between the UK Government and the Holy See in the Vatican this morning, led by the Rt Hon Baroness Warsi and His Excellency Archbishop Dominique Mamberti, Secretary for Relations with States.

It discussed the importance of the current visit and discussed the willingness of the government to work with the Holy See across a wide range of issues, while welcoming the positive role of the Catholic Church in British society.

The visit marks the 30th anniversary of the establishment of full diplomatic relations between the United Kingdom and the Holy See in 1982, and follows the successful visit by his Holiness Pope Benedict XVI to the United Kingdom in September 2010.

Other Ministers in the delegation include:

- The Rt Hon Jeremy Hunt MP, Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport  
- The Rt Hon Owen Paterson MP, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland  
- The Rt Hon Alan Duncan MP, Minister of State for International Development

The labour market statistics also show employment in Scotland has decreased by 20,000 over the three months to October - December 2011. The number of those in employment in Scotland now stands at 2,458,000.

The Scotland Office Minister David Mundell said:

""These figures are disappointing and show there are many challenges ahead for the Scottish and UK Governments. Each number we see today is not merely a statistic; it is an individual or family directly affected by unemployment.  That is why we are determined to do all we can to create the right conditions for the private sector to create long-term, sustainable jobs. The increased international uncertainty makes it all the more critical for the whole of the UK economy to maintain market confidence. This government's policies are achieving that aim.

""Today's figures also show youth unemployment continues to be a cause of great concern. The Secretary of State will chair a National Convention on Youth Employment in Dundee in March. This will bring together Ministers from both the UK and Scottish Governments, officials from their respective agencies, employers and representatives from the many organisations involved in supporting young people into work.""

"Scottish Secretary Michael Moore described today's referendum talks with the First Minister as a ""useful start"" although he said there is ""still some way to travel""  before the UK and Scottish Governments can reach agreement on the detail of the referendum.

Mr Moore said officials from both governments would now discuss the option of using a Section 30 Order, approved by the UK and Scottish Parliaments, in order to put the referendum on a proper legal footing.

The Scottish Secretary said that there were important issues such as the timing of the referendum and the need for a single question on the ballot paper and the franchise where the two governments do not agree.

Following the meeting in Edinburgh, Scottish Secretary Michael Moore said:

""The talks were helpful and both sides are keen to sort out the referendum process as quickly as possible so that we can get on to the real debate on Scotland's future.

""Having said that, this is the most important decision Scotland will ever make so we need to ensure the referendum is legal, fair and decisive.

""There is no question that we still have some way to travel to reach agreement on some important aspects of the referendum. I am still not convinced that the people of Scotland should have to wait nearly three years to have their say on independence. It is a long time until Autumn 2014 and I have still to hear a good reason for why we should have to wait so long.

""I also believe that an independence referendum should be a straight question on independence. Whether Scotland should be part of the UK is the issue we are dealing with. I want the people of Scotland to be asked a straight question, fairly and clearly, whether Scotland should be independent or remain part of the UK.

""The UK Government is also not persuaded that we should start changing the referendum rules to allow 16 and 17 year olds to vote. Our view is that the electorate that elects the Scottish Parliament should be the same one that votes in the referendum.

""It is in everyone's interests that both of Scotland's governments work together to agree a referendum that is legal, fair and decisive. We need a process and outcome that is fair for all of Scotland and that is what we're committed to achieving.""

"Organisations across Scotland will be able to apply for funding from the Coastal Communities Fund from April, allowing them to support the economic development of a wide range of projects including those that support charities, the environment, education and health.

The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore announced the launch of the fund's Prospectus on a visit to St Abb's Harbour in Berwickshire today (Thursday 9 February).

Scottish organisations will be able to express interest from March and make formal bids on the £4m fund in April. The Highlands is to  receive £1.85m from the fund, with £2.05m for the rest of Scotland from the overall £23.7m available throughout the UK.

The Fund will be financed by the Government from revenues from the Crown Estate's marine activities and will be UK wide.  Funding for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland will be determined by the amount of revenue generated in each country. 

The UK Government is working with the Big Fund, part of the Big Lottery Fund, to find the best ways to deliver benefits for Scotland's communities.

The Secretary of State Michael Moore welcomed the announcement and said:

""This is an innovative fund which will create many opportunities for coastal communities across Scotland and help strengthen local economies. The £4m available in 2012 can make a big difference and I hope organisations will respond to the opportunity with creative bids which help the wellbeing and opportunities of people in the area. The Crown Estate has been the focus of much debate in recent months and this initiative is a great example of the revenues raised in Scotland being put to good use.""

Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, said:

""Having grown up in a coastal community in Scotland, I am only too aware of the vital role these communities play in the UK. It is fair that we share the Crown Estate¿s marine revenues equally and I am delighted to launch the Coastal Communities fund prospectus today.

""We look forward to receiving innovative bids from charities, businesses, social enterprises and local organisations, which support the economic development of the community.""

"The Departmental Expenditure Limit (DEL) of the Scottish Government for the current financial year will be increased by more than £360m, Scottish Secretary Michael Moore announced today (Wednesday 8 February).

Publishing the Supplementary Estimates for 2011-12, Mr Moore said that Holyrood's capital spending would increase by £221m and resource spending by £140m.

Supplementary Estimates is the mechanism whereby the UK Parliament transfers money for the Scottish Parliament to spend on devolved matters. If the Scotland Bill, currently going through the UK Parliament, becomes law then, in future, Holyrood would raise around 35% of the money it spends.

Significant additional resources detailed in the statement today by the Scottish Secretary include:

- £50m in pre-payments to help with the new Forth Bridge;

- £50m for the Sleeper train service from Scotland to London;

- almost £16m in lieu of Barnett consequentials to settle the dispute over Olympic spending.

The Scottish Secretary said:

""The Scottish Government is benefitting from significant extra resources that have been made available by us in the course of this financial year. Some of this comes from the Barnett formula but a lot is also invested directly in Scotland by the UK Government. The basic state pension increase will benefit 1 million Scottish pensioners. Scottish drivers are being helped by our decision to defer the 3p fuel duty increase planned for January. The Youth Contract will also see the UK Government fund help for young people in Scotland looking for work.

""The new Forth Bridge and the Sleeper service are vitally important transport links for Scotland. They are also prime examples of how Scotland's two governments can work together to better serve the people of Scotland.

""The Scottish Government is already using the new pre-payment mechanism to help finance £50m of work on the new Forth Bridge. We also want them to benefit from the Scotland Bill tax powers - worth £12bn when added to Holyrood's existing tax powers - allowing them to raise a third of their own budget. This will provide Holyrood with more financial powers than ever before while retaining the financial security that comes with being a strong part of the UK.  The Sterling currency, low interest rates and a AAA rating are all important to Scotland.""

"The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore has said Scotland will benefit from the UK Government's latest food and drink export initiative launched today (Friday 27 January).

The Minister said Defra's Food and Drink Export Action Plan would set out how government and industry would work together to open up new key markets, including a plan to encourage and support manufacturers exporting overseas and a campaign to champion UK food abroad.

Defra worked with UKTI, industry trade associations and exporting companies to produce the plans in order to boost food and drink exports to high growth markets like India and China.

The Scotch Whisky Association has welcomed the initiative, saying it would create a ""joined-up approach to market access"" and increase the focus on removing trade barriers.

Michael Moore, who recently led the largest ever Scottish trade mission to Brazil, said:

""Scotland's food and drink is known across the world for its quality and this UK Government initiative will help support our companies as they further develop their business with the rest of the world. We have been working hard to secure further footholds in emerging markets, including securing geographical indication protection for Scotch whisky. This action plan will help exporters make the most of the huge global opportunities available to Scottish companies and will, in turn, help create and secure jobs and boost our economy.""

The project steering group which developed the action plan along with the export forum included Defra, UKTI, Food and Drink Federation, Food and Drink Exporters Association, Scotch Whisky Association, and the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board.

The Exports Action Plan includes plans to:

-       Hold regional road shows and business-to-business networking events to share best practice and encourage companies to export;

-       Make it far easier for companies to access the range of advice and support already available;

-       Make food export paperwork simpler and easier to access;

-       Better advertise the financial safeguards available to protect smaller companies from not being paid, which is a key concern;

-       Work across government and industry to get other countries to remove bans on British meat, such as beef and lamb to China.

-       Support inexperienced agri-food companies to showcase products at international tradeshows and trade missions;

-       Ministers and a new international business ambassador to provide high-level support and promote the best of British produce abroad;

-       Showcase British food and drink at the London Olympics 2012 to attract international buyers.

"Lord Wallace of Tankerness QC, the Advocate General for Scotland, has today said the Scottish  Government's forthcoming consultation paper cannot conceivably produce a solution to the legal problem which prevents Holyrood holding an independence referendum.

Lord Wallace reiterated the UK Government's legal view that the Scottish Parliament has no power to legislate for a referendum on independence and said it would make a great deal of sense for the First Minister and the Scottish Secretary to meet so that they can clear the path to a legal, fair and decisive referendum for the Scottish people.

The Advocate General said that any attempt by the Scottish Government to proceed with a referendum which is outside the Rule of Law would be ""a very worrying step for a democratically elected government to take"".

Lord Wallace will  give a lecture at Glasgow University on 20 January on Scotland's constitutional future. Speaking ahead of that lecture Lord Wallace commented on the UK Government's plans to facilitate a referendum on Scottish independence.

Lord Wallace said:

 ""Let me be clear. The Government wishes the referendum to take place on a sound legal basis, thus avoiding court challenge. The Government has therefore proposed a solution that involves devolving power to the Scottish Parliament that would avoid a referendum bill being dragged through the courts.  It would make a great deal of sense for the First Minister and the Scottish Secretary to meet so that they can start clearing the path to a legal, fair and decisive referendum for the Scottish people. There is no reason to delay these talks while we await  the Scottish Government's own consultation paper because there is nothing that could conceivably be in that document that will alter the legal position we face.

""The UK Government's legal view is that the Scottish Parliament has no power to deliver a referendum on independence. It does not matter whether such a referendum is described as ""advisory"", ""consultative"" or providing a basis for negotiations.  The Scottish Parliament has no power to legislate for a referendum on independence. 

""There are important consequences which follow from this.  One is that to proceed with a referendum that is outside of its legal powers would be to act contrary to the Rule of Law.  This is not a mere legal technicality as some commentators have suggested.  Government according to law is a fundamental principle of democracy.  To flout this principle would be a very worrying step for a democratically elected government to take.

""The second is that Scottish Parliament legislation paving the way for an unlawful referendum would be open to challenge in the courts.  That challenge could be initiated in the Court of Session by any individual or organisation with sufficient interest to bring proceedings.  It is important to note that a successful challenge in the courts could not only invalidate the outcome of the referendum -  it could stop the referendum happening in the first place.

""The UK Government acknowledges the political mandate achieved by the SNP at the May 2011 election.  It is precisely because of this political mandate that the UK Government is offering means to ensure that the Scottish Parliament has the power to deliver a referendum that is fair, legal and decisive.  The Section 30 order included in the Government's consultation paper would achieve this, and we are consulting in order to take the views of others on the issue.

 ""The UK Government is happy to discuss these crucially important constitutional issues.  As well as publishing the consultation itself, I look forward to a full airing of views at the question and answer session which will follow my public lecture.  I would also encourage both individuals and organisations to respond to the consultation ""

"Scottish Secretary Michael Moore is asking the First Minister to meet him in Edinburgh this week for talks on the independence referendum.

The UK Government wants to provide Holyrood with the legal powers for a fair and decisive referendum. Michael Moore has already spoken to Mr Salmond proposing talks and will write suggesting a specific time and place - Thursday in Edinburgh - to try and get things moving.

The Secretary of State said 'we want to have this referendum made in Scotland and we can start the work  in the nation's Capital this week.'

The UK Government made clear yesterday that they are happy to engage with the Scottish Government at all levels but that the first contact should be with the Scottish Secretary who is leading the referendum consultation.

Moore also said that he and his Ministerial colleagues will be out in Scotland this week listening to what people think about his referendum plans as well as making the case for Scotland remaining in the UK. Other UK ministers from Defra, BIS and the Foreign Office are due to be in Scotland over the next week and will help with this effort.

Moore will be addressing the CBI in Edinburgh on Monday and the Advocate General will be setting out the legal situation with the referendum at Glasgow University on Friday.

Michael Moore said:

'Since Tuesday, when I set out our plans for how  Scotland can hold a legal referendum, I have spoken to the First Minister and asked him to meet for talks. I have also written to him.

'I was pleased to hear him yesterday suggest talks with the UK Government and I want us to meet in Edinburgh this week to start making progress. We want this referendum made in Scotland and we should start the work this week in the nation's Capital.

'There are real legal problems that need solved and I hope we all share the desire to have a legal, fair and decisive referendum.  We should not waste any more time talking about talks. Let's get round the same table and get cracking with the arrangements for the most important decision Scotland will ever make.

'The sooner we sort out the process, the sooner we can get into the real debate about Scotland's future.'

"Being part of the United Kingdom means Scotland's farmers and fishermen can punch above their weight in Europe and the wider world, the Secretary of State for Scotland said today.

Michael Moore today welcomed the Environment Secretary, Caroline Spelman, to Scotland for a series of visits in the Lothians and Borders.

Moore accompanied Spelman on a visit to Eyemouth, where they met with local fishermen and seafood processors.  They then travelled on to Stow, to meet with representatives from the National Farmers Union of Scotland, and to the Glenkinchie Distillery in Pencaitland, where they discussed issues related to the whisky industry with officials from the Scotch Whisky Association.

Moore commented:

""I was delighted to join the Environment Secretary on her visits to local producers.  Scottish farmers and fishermen make a huge contribution to our society, producing the food we eat and supporting the wider economy, particularly in rural and coastal communities.  Scottish produce is renowned for its quality around the world, with exports increasing.

""The UK, as one of the world's leading economies, has the clout to negotiate the best possible deal for our producers with the European Union and to open up new markets through global trade negotiations.

""We are stronger when we speak with one voice.  We must continue to work together with the Scottish Government and the industry in Scotland to fight our corner around the world.""

Caroline Spelman said:

 ""Scotland's produce is becoming the envy of the world thanks to the hard work of fishermen, farmers and everyone else involved in food and drink production.

""The success that the industry achieved in 2011 was phenomenal and brought enormous benefits to the economy of not just Scotland but the whole of the UK.

""We must now find a way to make sure that the industry can thrive by reforming the Common Agriculture Policy and Common Fisheries Policy in a way that allows farmers and fishermen to continue to be successful in the future.""

"The UK Government is prepared to change the law so that the Scottish Parliament can hold a legal referendum on independence, Scottish Secretary Michael Moore announced today. The Government will now consult the people of Scotland on the best way to facilitate a legal, fair and decisive referendum.

In a statement to the House of Commons, the Secretary of State revealed that the  UK Government's clear legal view is that any independence referendum which the Scottish Parliament legislated for with its current powers would be unlawful as the constitution is reserved to the UK Parliament under the Scotland Act 1998.

Michael Moore said the UK Government's strongly held view is that Scotland should remain part of the UK but he told MPs that the 2011 Holyrood election result meant that there should now be a legal, fair and decisive referendum on Scottish independence.

The UK Government has today published a consultation document which looks at the ways in which a legal referendum on independence could be held.  While the document sets out a number of ways that a referendum could be legislated for, Ministers are prepared to use a Section 30 Order from the 1998 Scotland Act to devolve the necessary legal power to the Scottish Parliament. Such an Order requires the approval of the both the Scottish and UK Parliaments. 

The Government is clear that a referendum should be held sooner rather than later and the consultation proposes that the Order gives the Scottish Parliament power to hold a referendum by a specific date:  the Government has not set out a view on the specific date for a referendum in the consultation and invites views on when a referendum should be held. 

The paper also sets out what the Government regards as the essential criteria for a fair and decisive referendum. The Government is now consulting on these important matters with people in Scotland and will also seek the views of the Scottish Government. The consultation seeks views on issues such as:

- Should there be a single question on independence requiring a straight ""yes/no"" answer?  
- Should the referendum be run by the Electoral Commission following well established rules?  
- Who should have the vote?  
- What views are there on the timing of the referendum?

Speaking in the House of Commons, Michael Moore said:

""Since last year's election, we have been asking the Scottish Government to set out its plans for a referendum.  But so far it has not done so. In particular, it has not said anything more about its legal power to deliver a referendum. 

""This is not an issue that can be ducked. To legislate for a referendum on independence, the Scottish Parliament must have the legal power to do so.  It is the Government's clear view that the Scottish Parliament does not have that legal power.

""Scotland's future within the UK will be the most important decision we, as Scots, take in our lifetime.  It is essential that the referendum is legal, fair and decisive.  As a Government, we have been clear since May 2011 that we will not stand in the way of a referendum on independence.  But neither will we stand on the sidelines and let uncertainty continue.

""The 1998 Scotland Act is clear.  The Scottish Parliament cannot legislate on matters reserved to this Parliament.  Amongst the issues that are reserved is the constitution, including ""the Union of the Kingdoms of Scotland and England"".  Any Act of the Scottish Parliament that ""relates to"" a reserved matter is quite simply ""not law"". Whether or not a Bill ""relates to"" a reserved matter depends on its purpose and effect.  

""We are clear that the Scottish Government¿s purpose in bringing forward a referendum is to secure independence. Their intended effect is to secure a mandate for negotiating this.  Both purpose and effect relate directly to the reserved matter of the Union. Any distinction between a binding or advisory referendum is artificial.

""As the law stands, an independence referendum bill is outside the competence of the Scottish Parliament.  A bill could be challenged in court and it is our view that the Scottish Government would lose.

""So the consultation paper I am publishing today sets out different ways to deliver a legal, fair and decisive referendum.

""It explains how the powers for a referendum could be devolved under the Section 30 order-making provisions in the Scotland Act 1998 - our preferred approach.  It also invites views on devolving the powers using other legislation, including the current Scotland Bill, and for opinions on the possibility of running the referendum directly.

""Given the clear legal problem that exists, we want to work with the Scottish Government to provide the answer.  This is not about the mandates of Scotland's two governments, or who calls the shots.  It is about empowering the people of Scotland to participate in a legal referendum.  That means that the UK Government is willing to give the Scottish Parliament the powers to hold a referendum which they otherwise cannot do legally.

""Mr Speaker, this Government believes passionately in the United Kingdom. For over 300 years our country has brought people together in the most successful multi-national state the world has known. This Government is clear that independence is not in the interests of Scotland.  The United Kingdom brings strength to Scotland; Scotland brings strength to the United Kingdom.

""We recognise that this is not a view shared by all.  But politicians from both sides of the debate owe it to everyone in Scotland to ensure that the referendum is delivered in a legal, fair and decisive way. The future of Scotland must not be worked out in secret, behind closed doors.  Nor determined by wrangling in the courts.    It is my task to ensure this referendum is made in Scotland, by the people of Scotland, for the future of Scotland.""

The UK Government has now invited the Scottish Government to hold talks on trying to agree a way forward.

The consultation will run until March 9 after which the UK Government will announce how it intends to proceed.

"The Scotland Office Minister David Mundell visited the Scottish firm which built the Olympic basketball stadium in Glasgow today to see first-hand how Scotland is already benefiting from London hosting the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games this summer.

The Minister took a tour of Barr Construction to hear more about the challenges of building one of the largest temporary venues ever built and met with management and staff who had worked on delivering the project.

 David Mundell said:

""The Olympic year is going to be a great success for every part of the UK, including Scotland. Barr Construction has had a key role to play in delivering the Olympic facilities on time and on budget - they are a great example of just one of more than 100 Scottish companies doing well from the Games and the economic growth they are bringing to the whole of the UK.

""In addition to Scotland hosting a number of pre-Games training camps and Olympic football at Hampden , we will also have a number of Scottish Olympians competing in the Games. I am sure the whole country will support them and this once in a lifetime event."" 

This morning, the Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore attended a Cabinet meeting on the Olympic Park in Stratford, East London, chaired by the Prime Minister David Cameron. The meeting focused on how every part of the UK can take full advantage of the Olympic and Paralympic Games and the unique chance that that the country has to sell itself to a massive international audience.   
This afternoon, Cabinet Ministers are visiting towns and cities across the United Kingdom to see for themselves how businesses, sports facilities, schools and organisations are benefiting from the Olympic and Paralympic Games.

With little over seven months before the opening ceremony, the construction phase is 95% complete and the project continues to be on time and on budget. Since work began on the East London site in 2008, £6.39billion worth of contracts have been awarded to over 1500 business in the UK.

 More than 100 Scottish companies have secured tens of millions of pounds of contracts related to the Games, with 25 Scottish firms being directly involved in building the Olympic Park, including:

- Barr in Glasgow - which helped to build the basketball arena, one of the biggest temporary venues ever built  
- Impact Test Equipment in North Ayrshire - which provided aggregate for the Aquatics Centre  
- Balmoral Sectional Tanks in Aberdeen - which supplied utilities for the Olympic Stadium

Many more Scottish firms have picked up other Olympic-related contracts - from producing official Games merchandise, to providing temporary power across many of the Games venues.

Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport, Jeremy Hunt said:

""London 2012 gives us an opportunity to showcase the best of Britain to the world and what this country has to offer. From our beautiful countryside to historic sites, sporting venues to our amazing cultural offer Britain really does have something for everyone. I am confident that we will put on a sporting spectacular this summer with some magical, medal moments that we will never forget and that will inspire many young people to get involved in sport.""

"As we enter the new year I expect that the economy and constitution will feature just as prominently as they did in 2011.

While the economy has a direct effect on the lives of everyone it is normally the case that constitutional debate only really concerns those of us in the world of politics and the media. That is about to change as Scotland leaves 2011 knowing that we will soon need to make a decision on whether we wish to remain part of the UK.

We have seen the second year of the coalition government working towards getting the economy back on track. The global economic picture has been difficult, particularly within the Eurozone, but we have stayed our course and will be the better for it. The UK economy has remained stable against that backdrop, underlining the fact we made the right choices at the right time. That is what good government should be - making a choice and sticking with it.

Our deficit reduction plan has helped restore confidence in th UK economy and kept interest rates low but we are by no means immune to the issues facing our trading partners in the euro zone. Our borrowing costs have fallen to record lows, which shows the UK government debt is seen as a safe bet in the global debt crisis and our credit rating has been restored to its previous highest possible level.

But there is still much to do, particularly when it comes to employment. With the Scottish unemployment rate higher than the rest of the UK, both of Scotland's governments must focus on the issue in 2012. It will not be easy but we have already put major initiatives such as the Youth Contract in place and will continue to do all we can to get people back into work.

There are few issues of more importance to us all and I want to see all our powers, both reserved and devolved, brought to bear on it. That includes the pressing issue of youth unemployment which continues to affect cities and towns across Scotland. After a series of local events this year, in March I will host a national summit bringing together politicians, agencies, employers and others as we continue to put our collective effort into the fight to get young people into the job market.

But there is another issue facing Scotland which now looms large. The Scottish election result in May means that all of us across Scotland will soon need to decide where we stand on staying in the UK or becoming a separate country.  It will be the most important political decision that the Scottish people will ever make.

I am confident that people will listen to the arguments and make the right choice, but I want to make two important points on how we conduct this debate in 2012.

Firstly, we must have an open and frank debate. Everyone is entitled to their view and it is particularly important that experts in different fields are listened to respectfully, even if they are not agreed with.

I do not believe people will be neutral on this issue next year, given the great uncertainty it generates. It is too important - and potentially irreversible -  a subject for silence. We saw a number of strong opinions and arguments in favour of Scotland's place in the UK this year but I know many others hold similar views. Next year is the time to air them and choose to enter the debate: at stake is Scotland's place in the world and our future prosperity.

 Secondly, we need clarity in the next few months on how this important decision is to be arrived at.  Since May the Scottish Government has not been clear. As it stands we might have a referendum in 2014, 2015 or 2016. There is talk of multiple questions, different options and creating a whole new body to run the poll.  It's only fair for people in Scotland to be able to understand the plan.

I believe it is right that there now should be a referendum.  But equally, the Scottish people have the right to expect a referendum that is legal, fair and decisive. There are still many questions for the Scottish Government to answer.

Next year will also see the UK Government complete the legislation that transfers the largest ever set of financial powers to the Scottish Parliament. This will trigger a different kind of devolution with much greater financial accountability for MSPs at Holyrood.  
   
There are still some important milestones to pass. There are numerous amendments tabled in the House of Lords for the Committee stage which begins in late January. The Scottish Government want to see some changes, but we still need to see more detail from them. We will continue to work to fulfil this key coalition pledge to transfer much greater powers to the Scottish Parliament.

 I look forward to fighting hard for Scotland in 2012 and its continuing place in the UK, the most successful partnership of nations in history.

 The Olympics and the Queen's Diamond Jubilee  will also provide much for Scots everywhere to enjoy and celebrate in 2012.

 I wish you all a very happy and prosperous New Year.

The Scotland Office has given its support to the STV/Hunter Foundation Charity Appeal 2011 by choosing it for the official Scotland Office Christmas card this year.

In May STV and The Hunter Foundation (THF) announced they would be joining forces to launch a major new charitable venture for Scotland. This will run annually and provide support across a wide range of issues affecting Scotland. It will focus in this, its first, year on children affected by poverty. Six major Scottish charities which are recognised as well established experts in the area of child poverty are involved: Aberlour, Action for Children, Barnardo¿s Scotland, Children First, Save the Children Scotland and One Parent Families Scotland.

Scotland Office Ministers met with children and the organisers for the charities when they hosted the Appeal's launch in Dover House in September. The young people were asked to design a Christmas card for the Ministers.

The winning entry that was chosen by the Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore and was designed by Holly Mercer, aged 15, who is involved with the Aberlour Child Care Trust.

Michael Moore said: ""At this time of year it is important to remember people who are not as fortunate as most of us. It is a privilege to be associated with the STV/Hunter Foundation Charity Appeal 2011 and the good work they are doing with children affected by poverty. I would like to thank all those who designed cards for the appeal.""

Rob Woodward, Chief Executive of stv, said:  ""The children involved in designing the Christmas cards have done a great job and Holly's winning card is terrific.  The first year of the STV Appeal has been a huge success, raising over £1.2m for children and young people affected by poverty in Scotland.  We look forward to launching the 2012 Appeal, with every penny raised in Scotland staying in Scotland.""

"Fourteen cities across the UK have the chance to become super-connected cities, Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced today.

In the Autumn Statement, the Chancellor George Osborne announced up to 10 cities would share £100m and become super-connected with 80-100Mbps broadband access.

The four capitals - London, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast - will benefit while the others will be chosen through a competition. 

Today details of those eligible to apply have been published along with guidance for bidders.

The competition is open to the eight core cities and the UK cities that have more than 150,000 dwellings.  They are Birmingham, Bradford, Bristol, Glasgow, Leeds, Liverpool, Newcastle, Nottingham, Manchester and Sheffield.

These cities have the necessary size and economy to be able to use super-connected status to drive growth, attract new businesses to the area and transform the way services are provided and accessed.

The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore said:

""The UK Government is making millions of pounds available to support Scotland and its ongoing journey towards a super-connected future. The fact that Edinburgh is included is good news but I also hope Glasgow will put together a strong and convincing bid for funding and I will fully support the city's effort. Connecting Scotland to the next generation of broadband is increasingly important for our economy and this initiative shows how much Scotland can benefit from the UK Government's commitment to making our cities fit for the future.""

The Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport Jeremy Hunt said:

""The internet is now a fundamental part of our economy.  We must ensure the UK has a broadband network fit for the digital age.

""Transforming communities into super-connected cities will enable them to compete with the world's top digital cities. 

""It will help them attract new jobs and new investment and make the UK a place where digital businesses look to come.  It will help our creative industries and high-tech companies grow while making the UK even more attractive to overseas firms.

""New businesses are being set up because of the internet while many others are using the internet to grow.  We are determined to ensure the UK has the digital infrastructure we need to drive growth.""

As part of their proposal to the urban broadband fund, the cities will have to bid for a share of the £100 million and detail how they will use it. 

BT and Virgin will strengthen their networks in the winning cities to deliver 80-100Mbps broadband speeds.  The city's share of the £100 million can be used to provide coverage in areas where BT and Virgin will not go or services beyond what the market will provide.

The bidding cities will have to show how they will use super-connected status to drive growth with a particular focus on SMEs and strategic employment zones.

Proposals will also need to include plans for city-wide high-speed mobile connectivity and bidding cities will be expected to contribute to the cost by providing additional investment or using public assets.

Proposals have to be submitted by February 13 2012 and the successful cities will be announced in the Budget in March.  The Government will then work with the successful cities to produce fully developed plans and the money allocated to each city will be announced in July.

The four capitals will become super-connected cities but will still need to produce a plan detailing their proposals.

"The Scottish Government's lack of answers on the detail of an independent Scotland and the uncertainty created by its referendum timescale  are ""an extreme test of Scotland's patience"", the Secretary of State for Scotland said today (Tue 13 December).

Michael Moore raised the issue as a poll for the _Times _newspaper showed over two-thirds of people in Scotland want to see the referendum held earlier than the Scottish Government's planned timing.

The Ipsos MORI poll shows 64 per cent in favour of putting the question to Scotland earlier and less than a third (29 per cent) prefer the Scottish Government's timing. The same poll shows that support for independence across Scotland remains largely static at around a third.

""This poll shows the vast majority of people in Scotland want to end the uncertainty with an earlier vote on independence.

""Are we really expected to endure three or four more years of distraction and delay when every other country in Europe is focusing on the economy and jobs?

Around 10,000 of the scholarships are earmarked for UK universities and Glasgow will support the scheme by supplementing the £15,000 students will receive from the Brazilian Government.

The University will, every year, provide an additional £5,000 to 16 undergraduate study abroad students, and 16 postgraduate study abroad students, as well as offering eight scholarships of £5,000 a year for three years to full PhD students.

There will also be opportunities for up to six postdoctoral researchers to spend three months in Glasgow and the University will develop closer collaborative links between research groups in the two countries.

The scholarships, which will support tuition fees, travel and living costs, will be ready for entry from 2012 and will be announced by the Secretary of State for Scotland in Brazil as part of a Scottish Council for Development & Industry (SCDI) mission to Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo.

The Scottish Secretary Michael Moore is on the last day of the largest ever Scottish trade mission to Brazil. Earlier today he visited a Weir Minerals Plant which is part of the Scottish based Weir Group that employs over 9,000 people globally. He also had lunch with alumni of the Chevening Scholarship Programme which is an FCO run programme that identifies potential future leaders in politics, business and academia. 

Professor Anton Muscatelli, Principal & Vice Chancellor of the University of Glasgow said: ""The Brazilian Government, through the Science without Borders initiative, is committed to expanding science, technology and innovation across Brazil.

""We are pleased to support this drive by offering a generous set of bursaries for undergraduate and postgraduate students to come to Glasgow to develop their research skills.

""Brazil is a developing and increasingly important market for the Higher Education sector in Scotland and we are committed to meeting the demand for high-quality learning and research opportunities from our international partners.""

The Secretary of State for Scotland, Michael Moore, said:  ""I strongly welcome this initiative which is good news for the students involved and good news for Glasgow University and Scotland too.

""Through the meetings I have held this week we know there are significant opportunities in science and technology in Brazil. This funding will help develop lasting links that will benefit both our economies through an educated and skilled workforce.

""By bringing the brightest and the best from around the world, Glasgow University will only enhance its good standing in the world.

""The talent and ideas that these students will bring enrich the academic work of the University, and provide a valuable inter-cultural experience for the Brazilian students themselves and those they will study with in Scotland. ""

The historical links between Brazil and Glasgow stretch back to 1837 when the first person from Brazil to study at University of Glasgow - Antero Jacques da Silva - matriculated and studied in the Latin class of Professor William Ramsay.

"Scottish Secretary Michael Moore has said he hopes the First Minister will agree to give people in Scotland the certainty that comes with a legal, fair and decisive referendum when they meet in Edinburgh next Monday. 

Speaking to the Law Society of Scotland in Edinburgh, Mr Moore said everyone wants the referendum to be legal and it will be helpful if he and the First Minister can agree during their opening referendum talks next Monday  that a Section 30 order is regarded by both Governments as the ""preferred route to a legal referendum.""

A Section 30 Order can be used to devolve powers from Westminster to Holyrood and requires the approval of both Parliaments.

Michael Moore said good progress has been made in recent weeks and that ""we have already come too far to revert to a referendum that could land us all in the courts"".

Following the publication of referendum consultation papers by both the UK and Scottish Governments in January it was agreed that the Scottish Secretary and First Minister should hold talks. The first of these meetings is scheduled for Edinburgh on Monday, February 13th.

Speaking today Michael Moore said:

""On Monday, the First Minister and I will open talks on how we can deliver a legal, fair and decisive referendum for the people of Scotland. The Scottish people will not accept a referendum whose process and outcome will be open to legal challenge.

""Good progress has already been made in the past few weeks. Both Governments agree that we want a referendum that is free from legal dispute and that produces a result that everyone accepts.

""I think it would be helpful on Monday if we can agree that both Governments regard the Section 30 order as the preferred route to a legal referendum. There would still be a number of issues to discuss and resolve but it would send a strong signal that both Governments want to work together to make sure the referendum is legal.

""It would be good to agree in principle that, if we can sort out the detail,  a Section 30 Order, approved by both Parliaments, is what both Governments are aiming for.

""Good progress has already been made over the past few weeks on how we can achieve a legal, fair and decisive referendum.   We have already come too far to revert to referendum that could land us all in the courts.""

"The publication of the Scottish Government's referendum plans should clear the way for serious talks in Scotland about building a legal, fair and decisive referendum, said the Scottish Secretary Michael Moore.

The Minister said he is confident that talks with the First Minister in Edinburgh this Friday can ""plot the course towards agreeing a  legal referendum that follows the normal and fair rules that the Scottish people associate with a referendum"".

Speaking on the eve on the Scottish Government's consultation, Michael Moore said:

""Two weeks ago,  our Government published plans on how to create a legal, fair and decisive referendum on Scottish independence. Once the Scottish Government publish their plans the way should be clear for us to have serious discussions, right here in Scotland, about how we make such a referendum happen.

""I want the Scottish Government paper to have a clear acknowledgement that a legal referendum is in the interests of the Scottish people and that the two Governments should work together to achieve that. I also hope they will confirm that they support a simple yes-no question on independence. That is what people expect. I also hope that if the Scottish Government continue to put forward their preference of Autumn 2014 for a referendum that they will justify why they want three more years of delay and economic uncertainty.

""Everyone wants to have a referendum that avoids a courtroom wrangle. Everyone in Scotland expects to have a referendum that follows the normal and fair rules we associate with a referendum.  We should not start re-writing the rule book in the run up to the most important decision Scotland will ever make.

""The Scottish Government have shed more light on their referendum plans in the past two weeks then they did in the previous two years. We have seen real progress and there appears to be areas where we are very much in agreement. I believe the talks on Friday can help plot the course towards an agreeing a legal referendum that follows the normal rules and fair rules that the Scottish people associate with a referendum.""

"The Calman Steering Group is to be reconvened under the chairmanship of the new Secretary of State for Scotland Danny Alexander.

The announcement came following a constructive meeting today between Scotland Office Minister David Mundell and Scottish Labour Leader Iain Gray, and discussions with the other members, in the wake of yesterday's Queen's Speech.

The Group was originally set up to look at the implementation of the Calman Commission recommendations and had representatives from the Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat  parties at both Westminster and Holyrood.

Following the recent constructive talks in Edinburgh between the Prime Minister and the First Minister, the Scotland Office will also now have a dialogue with the Scottish Government on the Calman recommendations.

Mr Mundell said:

""The implementation of Calman recommendations is very important to Scotland.  We have shown a commitment to talking to the Scottish Government on how best to take this forward and it makes sense at this time for the Steering Group to continue to meet ensuring dialogue across and between all the main parties.

""At this exciting time for Scotland it is important that everyone works together in the national interest and I look forward to discussions with politicians from all parties in Scotland in the coming weeks.""

"Scotland Office Minister David Mundell visited Shetland today (Friday 21) to take part in a symbolic peat cutting ceremony to officially begin the construction work on TOTAL's new gas treatment plant at Sullom Voe.

Speaking about today's ceremony, Mr Mundell said:

""I am delighted to be in Shetland to mark an essential step forward for the UK's energy security. With one-fifth of the UK's remaining gas reserves, the West of Shetland fields will play a significant  role in meeting our energy needs as well as providing jobs in the local economy and beyond. Scotland has the skills and technology needed to make the most of our natural resources and I wish TOTAL and Shetland the very best of luck in the new project.""

Mr Mundell joined TOTAL executives and members of the Shetland Islands Council at a peat-cutting ceremony at the site, where essential earthworks for the new £500m plant are being carried out. This site preparation phase of the project is scheduled to run until 2011.

The onshore gas treatment plant is just one key element of TOTAL's £2.5bn Laggan-Tormore project, in which DONG Energy also has a 20% interest. The gas plant is due for completion in the Spring of 2014, with first-gas from the Laggan-Tormore fields expected to flow some weeks later.

Up to 700 jobs will be created during the Laggan-Tormore construction phase, with a further 70 permanent jobs being created once the fields are producing and the gas plant operational.

Roland Festor, MD of TOTAL E&P UK, commented:

""After what seems like a very long journey to reach this stage, we are delighted that construction work has now started on our Laggan-Tormore development. As well as extending TOTAL's presence on the UK Continental Shelf, the project will help secure domestic energy supplies for the UK and provide both jobs and economic investment for the Shetland Islands - so we hope today's ceremony is good news for everyone.""

"Scotland will gain clear benefits from the new era in British politics, Scottish Secretary Danny Alexander said today as the new Coalition Agreement was launched.

Today's Agreement, set out by the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister contains a number of commitments for Scotland.  These include:

  * Reviewing the control and use of accumulated and future revenues from the Fossil Fuel Levy in Scotland
  * Establishing a High Speed Rail network  for the whole of Britain
  * Investigating measures to help with fuel costs in remote rural areas
  * Introducing measures to ensure the rapid roll-out of superfast broadband across the country, in both rural and populated areas
  * Implementing the proposals of the Calman commission

The Scottish Secretary led the detailed talks which produced the Coalition Agreement published today.  He said:

""It was a lot of hard work but the end product is something that we can all be proud of and which sets a clear, radical and reforming programme for this  Coalition Government.""

Mr Alexander said that it was vital to Scotland that the UK Government was making the deficit reduction programme their overriding priority. He said that Scotland would also benefit from a number of UK wide measures - such as tax cuts and restoring the earnings link for the basic state pension - that affect the lives of many people in Scotland.

Scotland will also benefit from the significant political reforms outlined yesterday by the Deputy Prime Minister. This includes measures to make the House of Lords an elected chamber, allow the public to recall MPs in certain circumstances, fix the length of Parliamentary terms and to have a referendum on the voting system used at General Elections.

Danny Alexander said:

""This is a new dawn for British politics and Scotland is already benefitting greatly from it.

""The Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister have agreed the overriding priority of this Government is to reduce the deficit. This is as vital to Scotland as it is to the rest of the UK. The daily lives of many people in Scotland will also be improved by commitments in this Coalition Agreement to restore the earnings link for the basic state pension and to increase the personal allowance for income tax for those on lower and middle incomes.

""Today's announcement clearly underlines this coalition Government's commitment to Scotland and our decision to review the control and use of revenue from the Fossil Fuel Levy in Scotland sends a clear signal of our intention to work constructively with the Scottish Government.

""I am delighted the Chancellor has also agreed to look at ways of helping with fuel costs in remote and rural areas.  There are many rural communities in Scotland where soaring fuel costs are crippling drivers and hauliers and I am sure this announcement will be warmly welcomed by them.

""The establishment of a high speed rail network is something that would make travel by Scottish passengers faster and greener, bringing benefits to both our economy and our environment.

""So it is clear this deal will deliver great benefit to Scotland.  It's an exciting time as our new politics begin to shape a better future for us all.""

The Scottish Secretary Danny Alexander, led the Liberal Democrats negotiating team which formed the coalition government and he has maintained the leading role in putting together this Coalition Agreement.

The Coalition Agreement also contains a range of other matters that will extend to the whole of the UK.

"The UK Government's decision to end the overnight detention of children in Dungavel is an initial signal of how the new politics will work to make Scotland a better place, the Secretary of State for Scotland said today (Wednesday 19 May).

Danny Alexander confirmed the detention of children overnight in Dungavel will end with immediate effect.

There have been numerous and sustained calls for the practice to be abolished over the years and today's announcement shows the UK Government's commitment to both listening and acting quickly to create a fairer immigration system. 

The Secretary of State said:

""We said from the outset that our new government wanted to roll up its sleeves and get straight to the hard work of addressing the many challenges and issues we face.

""The overnight detention of children at Dungavel has now ended. We moved quickly as a government and I thank the Home Secretary for the attention she, her department and the UK Border Agency gave this issue after I raised it with her in the margins of our Cabinet meeting on Tuesday. I think it sends a very clear sign of the pragmatic way we intend to conduct ourselves as a government in Scotland.

""The UK Immigration Minister Damian Green has also announced a review, to be completed over the next few weeks, of the alternatives to detention for failed asylum seeking families across the UK.""

Visiting after the Prime Minister's meeting with the First Minister in Edinburgh, were met by 51 Brigade Commander Brigadier Allfrey and Battalion Commander Lt Col. Ed Fenton before being given an overview of 3 Scots who recently returned from Afghanistan where they took part in Op Herrick 10. 

Part of the briefing was on members of the battalion who excelled in their duties whilst on operational duty. 3 SCOTS did well in the Operations Honours list issued in March, with the then Commanding Officer Lt Col Stephen Cartwright, receiving an OBE, four others receiving Military Crosses and another seven (including Acting Sergeant Sean Binnie posthumously) being mentioned in Dispatches. A further seven personnel received Joint Commanders Commendations.

The Prime Minister and Secretary of State went on to have an informal meeting with serving soldiers and their families.

Following the visit, Danny Alexander said:

""It is always a privilege to meet the serving men and women of the Black Watch. It was especially good to see that so many had received commendations during their recent operational tour in Afghanistan. Our country owes them a deep and constant debt of gratitude for the dangers they face in protecting our country.

""As the local MP, it was good to hear from families about the wonderful support they receive from the community in Inverness whilst the troops are on active service overseas. They deserve nothing less while their loved ones are away sacrificing so much. Scotland has a long and very proud military history and this is embodied in The Black Watch and their achievements in their most recent deployment. 

""I was particularly pleased to welcome the Prime Minister to the Highlands as part of his first official visit to Scotland.""

The Black Watch, 3rd Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Scotland (known as '3 SCOTS'), is part of the Royal Regiment of Scotland. It is an Infantry Battalion whose primary role is close combat and it comprises three rifle companies, a fire support company and a headquarter/logistic element.

The current unit strength is 530 and its members are recruited centrally by the Regiment from across Scotland, although it retains strong links with its traditional antecedent heartlands of Perthshire, Fife and Tayside.

"The Emergency Budget today sets Scotland and the UK on a new economic path to stop spending beyond our means and to reduce the record deficit in a way that is fair to people on different incomes.

Public spending will fall in Scotland, with the actual figures for UK Government Departments who spend in Scotland and the Scottish Parliament budget to be announced in the Spending Review on 20 October. The devolved government in Scotland will be fully consulted ahead of that Spending Review as part of a national engagement process.

The Budget sets the overall envelope for government spending  which will be allocated between departments. The full detail of the Budget's effect on Scotland will therefore become clearer once detailed spending plans are set out in the Comprehensive Spending Review later this year. There are therefore no Barnett consequential figures available for Scotland from today's Budget

Measures which will affect Scotland include:

  * A rise in VAT to 20% effective from January
  * Changes to Capital Gains Tax, effective from tonight
  * A levy on banks
  * A rise of £1000 in the personal tax allowance to £7475, which will leave around 90,000 Scots on low incomes better off
  * An announcement that the Fossil Fuel Levy will be considered ahead of the Comprehensive Spending Review and that consideration is being given to a Fuel Duty Discount Scheme
  * No further changes to alcohol duty, protecting the Scotch whisky industry
  * Restoring the link between pensions and earnings, which will benefit around 1 million Scots
  * Maintaining the child element of tax credits to continue the fight against child poverty in Scotland
  * No change to the oil and gas tax regime
  * The reduction of corporation tax over the life of the Parliament
  * The avoidance of a benefit freeze, choosing instead a benefit uprating system based on the Consumer Price Index

The measures set out by the Chancellor will reduce the record £155bn budget deficit this government has inherited. Figures from the Office for Budget Responsibility recently showed the structural deficit facing the UK Government was £12 billion higher than previously thought. The material published today by Her Majesty's Treasury also shows that the burden is being fairly distributed across the range of income levels of UK taxpayers.

The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore said:

""Doing nothing in the face of a £155 billion deficit is simply not an option. The first duty  of the Coalition Government is to be responsible and take urgent action needed to tackle the record budget deficit  this government has inherited. That is the way we will get back to balanced growth - we have taken the first steps on that long journey today.

""Fairness is  at the heart of these tough decisions. We all need to play our part and the burden will fall in a fair manner.

""This is a credible plan which makes the tough choices we need to see if we are to restore confidence, recovery and growth. The simple fact is that we have to live within our means, as millions of British people and families do each and every day.

""We have to stop spending money that we don't have. It is not easy or popular to take the decisions we have today but it is unavoidable.  Irresponsibility  is what got us into this position in the first place.""

For the first time the forecasts underpinning the Budget  from the Office for Budget Responsibility are an independent, transparent assessment of the state of the economy  and public finances. The forecasts will improve the credibility of the fiscal framework and put the UK at the forefront of international best practice.

Tables in the Budget document will also show the impact of the decisions on different income groups clearly.

""The reduction of the deficit is this government's priority and there was significant discussion around the way we collectively tackle a huge legacy of debt. It is a challenge which will affect every man, woman and child across the UK and it is essential Scotland's two governments work together to address it. We also looked at ways to create and encourage a sustainable economic recovery as well as how Scottish Ministers could be more constructively involved in future European Councils.

""The Scottish Government also raised a number of specific issues of concern, such as the fossil fuel levy. We listened to their points and will consider them all constructively.

""These figures show the real human cost of the economic legacy the Government has inherited. Our Budget will tackle the record deficit and help us achieve balanced economic growth across the UK. These measures will keep interest rates lower for longer and encourage investment, both of which are important for the creation of new jobs.

This is the seventh such Institute Summer School and the 10th visit of UAE and Qatar students to Scotland in all when the Institute's Academic Training Programmes, held in January/February, are taken into account.

""We are extremely pleased that our students from the UAE and Qatar had the opportunity and honour to meet the Secretary of State for Scotland,"" said Professor Malory Nye, Principal of the Al-Maktoum Institute.

Her Majesty The Queen will be visiting the Gulf later this year so there is a growing recognition and desire to establish closer ties.

""The Institute, internationally recognised as a centre of excellence for Islamic and Arabic studies, enjoys the patronage of HH Shaikh Hamdan Bin Rashid Al-Maktoum, Deputy Ruler of Dubai and Minister of Finance and Industry of the United Arab Emirates.

""In recent years the links between Dundee and Scotland with Dubai have strengthened, so the opportunity for the UK to benefit likewise clearly exists.

""Over the past seven years, almost 350 students from the UAE and Qatar have come to Dundee and it's estimated that the twice-yearly visits represent a £200,000 boost to the local Dundee economy.

""Previous groups have returned home with a very positive view of Scotland so we hope this group will feel the same way and act as unofficial ambassadors for Scotland.""

""Today's meeting was a great opportunity to meet students from the emirates and to talk to them about how the UK government is looking to build closer working links with the Emirates

""As the next generation I was interested to hear there views on multiculturalism, how East and West can work together and how they view the links between Scotland and the UK.

  * Buildings of Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Glasgow
  * The Flow Country

  * St Andrews, Medieval Burgh and Links

Whoever wins will join the Taj Mahal, the Great Wall of China, The Statue of Liberty, The Great Pyramids and Red Square and several sites around Scotland - St Kilda, Old and New Towns of Edinburgh,  Heart of Orkney and New Lanark.

The Government conducted a review of its UK World Heritage Policy in December 2008. The aim was to help determine whether the UK should continue to nominate sites for World Heritage status and what more we should do for existing sites. The review considered the UK's approach to World Heritage, the costs and benefits of World heritage status, informed by research undertaken by Pricewaterhouse Coopers (PWC), on the management, protection and funding of sites, and the policy for future nominations.

An independent expert panel will be set up to advise Ministers on the applications. The selection process will be rigorous, aimed at discouraging at an early stage, those applications which are unlikely to succeed.

The Government proposes to submit a new Tentative List to UNESCO in 2011, with a view to re-commencing nominating from 2012. Following this, it proposes to continue to make nominations to the World Heritage List, though not necessarily every year.

"The new coalition government has pursued an agenda of mutual respect with the devolved administrations since coming to power. We will continue to do so as we believe it is in the best interests of Scotland for its politicians to work together. Respect, however, does not mean we will always agree. The path of our country's constitutional future is a topical and pressing case in point.

 

There is no escaping the fact the UK has to act decisively to meet the challenges of the financial crisis and the deficit legacy this government has inherited. That requires action which fits the task at hand. That is equally true of the Calman recommendations - they fit the time and purpose before them. 

 The Final Report of the Commission pulled off a remarkable feat. It balanced equity, efficiency and  accountability and created a way forward for Scotland which provides the basis for a logical next step for devolution. That was what it was tasked to do and it delivered, accepting the continuing reservation of macroeconomic policy to Westminster in the context of the continuing social and economic union of the UK.

 

I have been clear since being appointed as Secretary of State that this government is pressing ahead with implementing the recommendations of the Calman Commission. It is not considering alternative fiscal models. 

 

This has been stated in the coalition agreement, in the Queen's Speech, by the Prime Minister, my own appearance at the Scottish Parliament and by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury in his historic visit to Holyrood's finance committee. 

 

There should not be any doubt about the direction in which the UK Government is moving but neither should anyone doubt the solid reasons behind that position. We have a Scotland Bill being drafted and the implementation groups getting underway: in short, the Calman process is already moving and has momentum, support and depth of thinking in its favour. Our process is about focus and delivery.

 

 We will implement the Calman proposals to make them work as efficiently as possible and that means we are open to suggestions which address technical  concerns. We have asked the Scottish Government to be a part of that process and they have already provided input. 

 

But no one should interpret that flexibility as a sign Calman has been superseded by events.  The Express article of last Thursday said the ""Calman proposals are a halfway house and a messy fudge"". I do not believe that to be the case. 

 

The Commission spent 13 months of intense consideration by the majority of political parties on how best to meet Scotland's needs and introduce fiscal accountability to the Scottish Parliament. This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to change our political landscape. We are dedicated to making it work as well as possible. Others have a prime opportunity to join us in that endeavour. The alternative is to sit out on the sidelines. I would prefer to see us work together.

 

All too often in recent weeks the arguments we have seen in for full fiscal autonomy have been heavy on assertion and light on detailed evidence. We must be precise when it comes to making calls for significant changes to the Scottish Parliament's financial accountability.

 

We also need to be clear that there is not, as claimed in some quarters, an ""overwhelming consensus"" to move to fiscal autonomy at this time. We must not forget that the Calman Commission didn't consist of 15 men and women meeting in secret: it involved an extensive process of engagement across Scotland.  The Commission emphatically concluded that devolved government met the aspirations of the people of Scotland and worked well in practice.  All three UK parties share this view and all three included it in their manifestos in May. A strong mandate was achieved for Calman at the election. 

 

It is now over a year since Sir Kenneth Calman's report and it has become embedded in our political discourse in Scotland.

 

Some may be blase about how radical the report's findings are but it is viewed very differently by the rest of us. The Calman recommendations are a substantial and substantiated review of the devolution settlement.  We are not talking about tweaking the existing settlement. 

 

 

Calman will produce real-world change: it will ensure that existing political accountability at the ballot box will be enhanced by substantially increased financial accountability for the Scottish Parliament and the Government formed from it. 

 

With this enhanced devolution, we will continue to benefit from being a fundamental part of the world's sixth largest economy. We have the resilience associated with diversification across many economic sectors. Our tax system allows us totally unimpeded access to the world's oldest free trade area.  We spread the costs of nationhood across 60 million people rather than 5 million. The Calman proposals build on those undeniable strengths while strengthening financial accountability within Scotland and that is why we are taking them forward into a Scotland Bill this autumn.

After the visit Mr Mundell said:

""Edinbane represents a significant engineering feat, having been constructed in one of the farthest flung corners of the British Isles. It is well worthy of celebration for that alone, as well as it rebewable energy generating capacity. I was delighted to perform the opening along with local children from nearby Struan Primary School.""

Anders Dahl, head of Vattenfall Wind Power, said: ""We are happy to be opening Edinbane Wind Farm, Vattenfall's first onshore wind farm in the UK. We are pleased that Vattenfall's investment in onshore wind is being recognised by the Minister and the Coalition Government.""

"Unemployment in Scotland increased to 223,000, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) data released today. The Scottish unemployment rate is 8.4 per cent, above the UK average unemployment rate of 7.8 per cent.

The labour market statistics also show employment in Scotland has increased by 8,000 over the previous three months. The number of those in employment in Scotland now stands at 2,444,000.

The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore said:

""These disappointing figures are another undesirable reminder of the economic legacy this Government has inherited and leaves us in no doubt about the challenges ahead. Any increase in unemployment is not just a mere statistic but represents real people who pay the price for the previous government mismanaging the economy.

""The Government's measures to achieve our priorities of tackling the record deficit and achieving balanced economic growth for all parts of the UK will encourage the necessary investment to create new jobs.

""Measures announced in our Budget will create the most competitive corporate tax system in the G20 over the next four years and Scottish businesses will be saving around £280 million because of the increase in the employers' National Insurance Contributions threshold alone.

""The Government recognises also that access to finance is critical for businesses to survive and grow and that small and medium-sized companies face particular challenges. This is why we launched Financing a Private Sector Recovery to encourage a private sector recovery by addressing the problems businesses face accessing finance. Working with businesses and the financial community is crucial to ensure that access to finance is not a barrier for companies looking to invest and boost the growth of the economy and creating sustainable jobs.""

"The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore was in Moray today (Tuesday 28 September) to visit the RAF Kinloss and RAF Lossiemouth bases as part of his ministerial tour of the country.

He was given tours of both bases, which included a briefing with senior military staff on Kinloss's Nimrod MRA4 aircraft and the base's search and rescue and mountain operations as well as the Nimrod flight simulator. He later travelled to Lossiemouth, currently Britain's main base for Tornado GR4s. He met RAF personnel on both sites.

The Minister also attended the Defence Quadrilateral meeting between the Defence Secretary and the Secretaries of State for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, at which the Scottish Government were also present. He linked to the meeting by videoconference from Kinloss.

The Secretary of State later met with the Moray Community Planning Partnership in Elgin. It was the second meeting between the minister and the local representative group following their trip to the Scotland Office in London to discuss the bases earlier in September.

The Secretary of State said:

""Today I had another opportunity to see at first hand the professionalism and excellence of our armed forces.

""Scotland contributes a great deal to the strategic defence of the UK and the forces' presence generates employment and pride too.

""I am continuing to make those points fully understood in government as the strategic defence review continues.

""This was a valuable opportunity for the territorial Secretaries of State and the devolved governments to make clear their concerns. This is not an issue with which to play politics. Everyone at the meeting demonstrated a will to be constructive and find solutions that will ensure our national security, safeguard our communities and provide real value.""

Mr Moore has now visited all of Scotland's RAF bases, having attended the RAF Leuchars air show where he met senior RAF personnel. He has also visited Rosyth and will visit BAE at Govan and Scotstoun next week and plans to visit Faslane shortly.

"Advocate General Lord Wallace of Tankerness QC is to consult the legal community on a technical issue concerning the procedure whereby acts of the Lord Advocate, carried out in her role as Scotland's prosecutor, may be challenged under the Scotland Act 1998.

Devolution legislation provides that members of the Scottish Executive, including the Lord Advocate, have no power to act incompatibly with Convention rights or with EU law. The Scotland Act provides for a procedure to challenge any act alleged to be in breach of such provision. This is different from other parts of the United Kingdom where the actions of prosecuting authorities are, for instance, covered by the Human Rights Act in relation to alleged breaches of Convention rights. In question is whether the procedure under the Scotland Act causes problems for the operation of the courts or the system of criminal justice in Scotland.

The Advocate General has established an Expert Group to advise UK Ministers on this matter and he is also seeking views of other interested parties by October 22nd through an informal consultation into ""Devolution issues and the acts of the Lord Advocate"".

The members of the Advocate General's Expert Group are:

  * Sir David Edward KCMG, QC (Chairman)
  * The Rt Hon Lord Boyd of Duncansby QC
  * Professor Tom Mullen (Glasgow University)
  * Frances McMenamin QC
  * Paul McBride QC

The short consultation process comes as a result of the Commission on Scottish Devolution (Calman Commission) which considered the issue that acts of the Lord Advocate in her capacity as head of the system of prosecutions can give rise to challenges (""devolution issues"") under the Scotland Act.

The issues were mainly raised in a submission from the Judiciary in the Court of Session during the Commission's round of evidence gathering.

The Commission did not make any recommendation on the matter, given its remit, but recognised this gives rise to important issues affecting prosecutions in Scotland.

In order to inform the expert group's deliberations in this highly specialised area, the Advocate General also wishes to conduct a short, informal, focused consultation with representative bodies and other interested parties.

[A short paper on the issue on the Devolution issues and the acts of the Lord Advocate is available on the Advocate General's website](http://www.advocategeneral.gov.uk/oag/102.62.html).

"The Scotland Office begins the search for a new member of the Boundary Commission for Scotland today. The appointment will be made by the Secretary of State, following an open competition that is regulated by the Commissioner for Public Appointments.

The appointment will commence in January 2011, following the departure of Dr Elspeth Graham after 11 successful years in the post.

The Boundary Commission for Scotland is an advisory Non-Departmental Public Body that is sponsored and wholly funded by the Scotland Office. It is an independent, non-political body constituted by the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986. The Commission's duties and powers are detailed in that Act, and in Schedule 1 of the Scotland Act 1998.

The Commission is responsible for reviews of:

  * constituencies and regions for the Scottish Parliament; and
  * constituencies in Scotland for the Westminster Parliament.

These duties and powers, in relation to reviews of constituencies for the Westminster Parliament, are expected to change following passage of the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Bill, currently under consideration by Parliament.  The Bill is expected to result in the reduction of the number of Westminster constituencies in Scotland from 59 to 52, and much greater equality of elector numbers between constituencies.  As a result, the Commission expects to commence a review early in 2011 which will result in substantial redrawing of Westminster constituency boundaries.

The Order provides for the conduct of elections for membership of the Scottish Parliament and updates the existing provisions on the conduct of those elections.

It makes a number of changes to the way MSPs are elected, including:

  * registered party names will appear first on the regional ballot paper followed by the party description, with the option to use the preface ""Scottish""
  * a return to manual counting of the ballot papers, following the use of electronic counting in 2007
  * the re-introduction of separate ballot papers for the constituency and regional votes
  * a longer period (extended by an additional seven working days) between the close of nominations and the election, which will improve the way postal votes are handled

The Secretary of State Michael Moore said: ""I welcome today's Order and the positive changes it will make to the way the Scottish Parliament elections are run. There is no doubt public confidence needs to be repaired after the problems that were experienced in 2007. This Order is now with the Electoral Commission, electoral administrators, political parties and the Scottish Government which will allow them to begin planning the Holyrood elections in detail. The Scotland Office will work closely across these groups to ensure the 5 May elections run smoothly.""

"The Secretary of State for Scotland will establish a response group within the Scotland Office to deal with issues faced by Moray as a result of the recent Defence Review.

During a meeting at the Council headquarters in Elgin today (Thursday 21 October), Michael Moore said he was setting up the group to ensure people in the area had access to information and support from across the relevant Westminster departments. 

He met the Moray Community Planning Partnership along with a representative of Highland and Islands Enterprise and Moray politicians Angus Robertson MP and Richard Lochhead MSP.

The meeting covered a range of issues following the announcement by the Ministry of Defence that the contract for the next generation of Nimrod MRA4s, which were to be based at RAF Kinloss, would be cancelled as part of the review.

The future options for RAF Lossiemouth were also discussed and the Minister received a briefing on the Scottish Government's Moray taskforce initiative. The Secretary of State also met the Base Commander of RAF Kinloss.

Speaking after the meeting, Moore said:

""I recognise Moray and its bases have received very bad news this week and that there is still uncertainty hanging over its future. This is a result of difficult decisions made by the government dealing with the largest deficit in peacetime.

""We know there is anger and worry among personnel, their families and the local communities whose economies are linked to the base. I made it clear again today, as the Deputy Prime Minister did earlier in the week, that the UK Government will not abandon the communities in Moray.

""The Scotland Office response group I have announced today is important as it will open up access to the relevant departments needed to support the area at this difficult point and beyond. I will ensure Moray's voice is heard where it matters most.

""It is also important to underline no decision has yet been made on the future of Lossiemouth. I will continue to make the case for the base at the highest levels of government.""

""For Scotland, this is a fair deal in tough times.

""By 2015, the Scottish Government's budget will go down by 10.6% in total, significantly less than the Scottish Government's published forecast.

""Spending on frontline public services will be reduced by less than in England, Wales or Northern Ireland.

""There are no easy choices in the current economic climate.  Scotland will pay its fair share towards reducing the record peacetime deficit that we have inherited.

""If we don't address that £155 billion deficit now, Scots will end up paying longer and paying more.

""This spending review has put a premium on reform, fairness and growth.

""I hope that the Scottish Government will now do the same and publish its four year spending review.

""Rosyth and Glasgow have a proud history in naval shipbuilding. Our decision to invest £5bn in the two new Queen Elizabeth carriers means they will now be building the largest ships ever ordered by the Royal Navy. This is great news for the workers in the yards, the businesses in the supply chain and the skills base that we will keep here in Scotland.

""This is a massive investment into the Scottish economy and it is a massive vote of confidence in the world class shipbuilding you find in Scotland.

""While this news will be warmly welcomed in Fife and Glasgow the Defence Review was always going to contain difficult news as well. I know that Moray will be deeply concerned about the decision on the RAF Bases. I intend to visit the area next week to meet again with the Moray Partnership and other stakeholders. I will discuss what can be done to achieve the best outcome from what is undoubtedly a very unsettling development for these communities.

""In Scotland earlier today the Deputy Prime Minister today was absolutely clear that we are not going to abandon the communities of Moray. I have already spoken to the Defence Secretary and he is determined to maintain a defence footprint throughout the United Kingdom. I am determined that Moray will remain part of that footprint.""

Speaking ahead of the Comprehensive Spending Review on Wednesday, he said:

""The scale of the dreadful financial legacy we inherited means we have to act. Failing to get to grips with the challenges our economy face is not an option.

""The record peacetime deficit that we inherited will get worse if it is ignored. The choice is to reduce it fairly and now or pay longer and more. We didn't create this mess but good governments face reality and take responsibility. Bad ones stick their heads in the sand.""

""I welcome the news the number of people receiving Jobseeker's Allowance fell last month. A lot of work  is needed to create a long-lasting labour market recovery and we have already begun that task.

Michael Moore was on a tour of the Scotstoun and Govan yards to meet the workforce at BAE Systems and to see the work currently being carried out on the Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carrier and other vessels.

He held a number of meetings with senior management and unions before he was given a tour of the yards to see HMS Dragon in dry dock and the fabrication sheds to see progress being made on the carrier blocks, as well as meeting apprentices and other staff.

The Minister said: ""I have been impressed by the commitment of those who work in our shipyards and this visit to the Clyde helped reinforce the fact we have a world-class skills base here in Scotland.

""I have been working hard to make the best arguments for defence in Scotland at the highest levels of government.""

"The Scottish Parliament is to receive new tax and borrowing powers of around £12 billion under plans published today in the Scotland Bill by Scottish Secretary Michael Moore.

The Scotland Bill legislation will implement the recommendations of the Calman Commission to improve devolution in Scotland. It will update devolution and introduce far more financial accountability than before. The Bill will bring decision-making closer to the people of Scotland and further empower the Scottish Parliament.

The Scotland Bill is just part of the Government's response to the Commission's recommendations.  The Bill will be accompanied by a Command Paper which sets out how the Government is responding to all the recommendations from the Commission, not only improving the legal framework that established devolution in Scotland, but also supporting the relationships between officials, Ministers and Parliaments to ensure its continuing success.

### Borrowing

The legislation also provides the Scottish Government with borrowing powers for the first time. The £2.7 billion capital and resource powers proposed by the UK Government go further than the recommendations of the Calman Commission.

### Financial Powers

The Scotland Bill is the largest transfer of financial power from London since the creation of the UK. In future, Holyrood will have to set a Scottish income tax rate each year to raise a significant share of the revenue it spends. This power will be available from 2015 and will apply equally to the basic, higher and additional rates of income tax.

When the new Scottish tax system is implemented the Scottish Parliament will be responsible for raising approximately 35% of the  revenue it spends with the remaining 65% coming from the UK Block Grant.

Key elements of this part of the Bill are the transitional arrangements and phasing of new powers which are designed to manage adverse shocks to the Scottish budget.  The UK Government will work closely with the Scottish Government and Parliament over the next four years to finalise all the elements of the new system.

For the first time, the Office for Budget Responsibility will begin to provide forecasts of Scottish income tax, landfill tax and stamp duty land tax.

The Scottish Parliament will also be able to introduce new Scotland-specific taxes, subject to the agreement of the UK Parliament.

Other financial powers being given to Holyrood include a new Scottish cash reserve and participation for Scottish Ministers on a new UK-Scottish Tax committee (the Intergovernmental Bilateral Committee on Fiscal Devolution).

The Commission recommended the devolution of aggregates levy and air passenger duty. The first is currently the subject of EU litigation and the second is being reviewed by the Coalition Government in the light of its stated intent to introduce a per-plane tax. 

### Justice powers

The Scotland Bill will also transfer a number of policy powers to the Scottish Parliament from Westminster. In future Holyrood will be able to legislate in areas such as:

  * air weapons
  * drink-drive limit
  * national speed limits
  * Other powers

Details of further powers which will transfer to Scottish Ministers and other elements of the Bill can be found in the accompanying Command Paper. They include:

  * the formal recognition of the term ""Scottish Government"" which will replace ""Scottish Executive""
  * the devolution of certain executive functions regarding the administration of elections
  * the function of determining which doctors in Scotland may be licensed to administer specific drugs for the treatment of drug addiction
  * the creation of a specific Scottish Crown Estate Commissioner

It also provides for UK Ministers to act jointly with Scottish Ministers in deciding who to recommend for appointment as the BBC Trust member for Scotland.

The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore said :

""This Bill is the culmination of work by three Scottish political parties, numerous impartial experts, two successive UK Governments and the two Parliaments in London and Edinburgh.

""It is a powerful blueprint which will strengthen Scotland by improving devolution.

""Future Scottish governments will have more accountability to the public for the financial decisions they make and will have access to significant borrowing powers. Devolution has worked well over the last decade but today's Bill addresses a number of major issues and takes the settlement forward in a powerful and positive way.

""We have created a Bill which is the right one for Scotland  and which I am confident will stand the test of time.

""The Calman process had the support of the Scottish and UK Parliaments. We are going further than Calman in some important areas and we are going to work hard to retain the support of both Parliaments.""

"Scottish Secretary Michael Moore today officially opened the £45m Longpark windfarm in the Scottish Borders. The 19 turbine site will generate enough electricity for 19,000 homes when it becomes fully operational in 2011.

Mr Moore said:

""This government has pledged to be the greenest that our country has ever seen, and we are doing just that.  This windfarm is a further step in developing Scotland's renewable energy infrastructure and a great example of how we are harnessing our natural geography to produce renewable energy.

""The energy generated here will power up to 19,000 homes and reduce CO2 emissions by around 43,000 tonnes. Investing in renewables is vital for our country and our economy.  By doing so, the coalition government will create a 'zero-waste' economy.""

The Longpark site is situated south of Stow in the Scottish Borders and was given government approval in July 2006. The site is capable of generating 38MW of power - the equivalent of powering enough kettles to make more than 3.5 billion cups of tea per year.  The yearly estimated production is 87 GWh an equivalent of 2,300 hours of full load/year.

The site was developed by Wind Prospect and is owned and operated by EDF Energy Renewables and is their first windfarm in Scotland.

"The main tax raising power voted for by the Scottish people in the 1997 Devolution Referendum is currently not available to MSPs. The Scottish Secretary Michael Moore has today written to the First Minister and other Holyrood leaders to inform them that a decision by the Scottish Government not to commit resources to maintain the Scottish Variable Rate (SVR) tax power means that HMRC could no longer collect such a tax.

The SVR is the power to lower or raise the basic rate of income tax by 3p.

Mr Swinney told MSPs yesterday that he would not raise the Scottish Variable Rate of income tax but Mr Moore makes clear in his letter today that decisions taken by the Scottish Government mean the SVR power could not now be used before the 2013/14 tax year. The Scottish Secretary has written to the other main parties to advise them that they will not be able to use this power until the penultimate year of the next Parliament.

Michael Moore said:

""The previous arrangements to ensure that the SVR tax could be invoked within 10 months were allowed to lapse in 2007.  I am not privy to the discussions that went on between 2007 and 2010 but I do know that the Scottish Government informed us in August that they were not going to pay for HMRC to work on the PAYE systems to enable the SVR to be available after the 2011 election.

""It is now clear that because the system has not been maintained at the previous ten-month readiness, HMRC would require two years notice to invoke the SVR. I am conscious that the various political parties will be considering their policy programmes for next year's Holyrood election. I felt it was imperative to inform them that this tax power, which formed part of the original devolution settlement, is not  available to whoever forms the next Scottish Government.

""It is worth saying that the forthcoming Scotland Bill that I will publish in the next few weeks will contain the biggest transfer of financial powers from London since the creation of the UK. Our expectation is that these greater powers would be available to MSPs from 2015.""

The 1998 Scotland Act section 80 allows for any administrative costs incurred by HMRC in relation to the Scottish Parliament's tax varying power to be met by Scottish Ministers, whilst it is an established principle that the costs of devolution should be met from the Scottish Budget. The SVR power has never been used by the Scottish Parliament.

John Swinney made the following comment in the Scottish Parliament yesterday:

""Within the Parliament's existing revenue powers, we have explored options for maximising our income. We have been mindful of the need to consider the effect of the significant tax rises that the UK Government has announced before we act. I therefore confirm that we will not raise the Scottish variable rate of income tax.""

"Scottish Secretary Michael Moore said the Government's welfare reforms will help Scots back into work. He said it would be fairer and 'ensure that work always pays'. Mr Moore said it will address the problem of people becoming trapped on benefits because of the financial disincentives to take up work.

The Universal Credit White Paper was published today. It is the most radical overhaul of the benefits system in a generation and simplifies the main welfare benefits into one single system.

Another main feature of the reforms is to stop people who take up work losing out financially. In some cases people can lose up to 90% of earnings through paying tax and the removal of benefits. Under the new plans, as earnings rise, the Universal Credit will be withdrawn at a constant rate of around 65p for every pound of net earning.

Michael Moore said:

""Too many Scots have been out of work for too long. Most people who are out of a job want to get back to work, and this government will help them do that.

""These are radical changes to make the welfare system fairer and  easier to understand.

""We will provide proper support for those who can't work, help to get those who can work into work, and ensure that work always pays.

""People mustn't be penalised financially for taking up jobs and trying to support their families. It can't be right that someone finds themselves out of pocket by taking up a job. That is deeply unfair, and we will put a stop to it.

""It's also right that steps are taken to ensure people can't simply opt out of the process of finding a job.

"The Secretary of State for Scotland, Michael Moore MP, today marked a major milestone in Rio Tinto Alcan's £45m investment at its plant in Lochaber in the Scottish Highlands. The third of five new generators, built to power the smelter with renewable energy, has been installed.

 During a visit to the plant to review progress with the investment, Michael Moore MP, Secretary of State for Scotland said:

 

""This project, and Rio Tinto Alcan's major investment, is of massive importance to this part of Scotland. The smelter and its jobs are vital to this community. What is equally heartening is to see a global company doing its bit to contribute to developing clean energy, green jobs and of course to helping Scotland meet its renewable energy targets.""

 

The new modern hydroelectric generators have the capacity to generate the plant¿s required electricity supply, as well as the potential to generate additional power. As a result of the increased power generation, it is expected that aluminium production at Lochaber could increase from 43,000 tonnes per year to 50,000 tonnes per year.

 

The Rio Tinto Alcan plant in Lochaber contributes over £8 million a year to the Highlands economy and employs 170 people, making it one of the Highlands' largest private sector employers. It also helps underpin an additional 400 jobs through indirect employment and supply chain opportunities. This repowering project will offer much needed long-term job security in the region.

 

The new generators will replace the existing hydro generators at the Lochaber plant which have been in use since their installation in 1929. The £45 million modernisation project, which began in 2009, will be completed by 2012.

"The UK Government will only proceed with their radical plans to strengthen Scottish devolution ""with the formal and explicit consent of the Scottish Parliament"", Scottish Secretary Michael Moore confirmed in the House of Commons today.

Opening the debate on the 2nd Reading of the Scotland Bill, Mr Moore told MPs that the Coalition Government's legislation amounted to the largest transfer of fiscal powers from London since the creation of the UK. He said it would fundamentally change the powers and responsibilities of the Scottish Parliament and, for that reason, could only happen with the agreement of the Holyrood.

The 2nd Reading debate in the House of Commons is the start of the UK Parliament's scrutiny of the Scotland Bill. The Scottish Parliament established a Scotland Bill Committee in December to study the Bill in detail. The Scottish Parliament is expected to vote on a Legislative Consent Motion for the Scotland Bill in March.

The Scotland Bill is the UK Government's legislation to implement the recommendations of the Calman Commission which examined ways to strengthen devolution in Scotland.

If supported by the UK and Scottish Parliaments, the Scotland Bill will mean that:

  * MSPs at Holyrood will have to set a Scottish rate of income tax each year and will be responsible for raising a much greater proportion (around 35%) of the revenue they spend.
  * The Scottish Parliament with get borrowing powers of £2.7bn
  * The Scottish Parliament will have responsibility for stamp duty, landfill tax and the ability to propose new taxes.
  * Policy responsibility in areas such as air weapons, drink drive limits and speed limits will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament and Scottish Government.
  * A Scottish Cash Reserve will be created to bank and save money where tax receipts exceed those expected.

Opening the 2nd Reading debate in the House of Commons, Scottish Secretary Michael Moore said:

""We have a Parliament in Scotland that can determine policy on a wide range of subjects.  It can determine how and where money is spent.  But at present it cannot be held effectively to account for raising the money it spends

""The Scotland Bill addresses that imbalance by providing a package of taxation and borrowing powers that will see the Scottish Parliament become accountable for over a third of the money it spends. In doing so, the Bill represents the largest transfer of fiscal powers from central government since the creation of the United Kingdom. 

""It is a radical but responsible step. Most significantly, we will create a Scottish income tax.  We will create that tax by cutting 10 pence off the basic, higher and 50 pence tax rates for Scottish taxpayers, adjusting the block grant in proportion, and allowing the Scottish Parliament - indeed, obliging it - to reset those rates at a level of their choosing.

""This will give Scottish Ministers and the Scottish Parliament a much more significant stake in the performance of the Scottish economy.  The level of the Scottish rate will be Scotland's to decide.  And those who set the rates will answer directly to those affected by them. Power will rest with the Scottish people.

""Mr Speaker, this is the first time since the creation of devolution that a Government has brought forward legislation with such wide-ranging effect on the current settlement. Indeed, this Bill will fundamentally change the powers and responsibilities of the Scottish Parliament. 

""For that reason, this Government will only proceed with this Bill with the formal and explicit consent of the Scottish Parliament.

""It is right and proper that the Scottish Parliament should examine the measures that we set out in the Scotland Bill.  I welcome the thorough way in which it is going about its business.  And I look forward to returning to discuss the provisions with the Bill committee in the Scottish Parliament next week.""

""The fact GDP shrank in the last quarter is an obvious cause for concern but it is clear that extraordinary circumstances played a key part. The cold weather has had a significant knock-on effect in our economy.

""The government has put a fiscal plan in place to reduce the deficit. Today the IMF has again said the failure to implement credible fiscal consolidation plans is a risk to growth in advanced economies.

"The Coalition Government's announcement that children of asylum seekers will no longer be kept in detention centres is a ""long overdue step towards a compassionate but effective immigration system"", said the Secretary of State for Scotland.

Michael Moore made the comments following the publication of a new approach to family removals following a wide-reaching review of the detention of children. As a result, Yarl's Wood Immigration Removal Centre in England will close to children immediately.

There have been no overnight detentions of families in Scotland since an announcement by the Coalition Government in May this year.

The review will see the UK Border Agency (UKBA) change its approach and adopting a new four stage process which focuses on engagement with families during the decision making process, giving parents the opportunity to engage in when and how they return, when they have been found to have no legal right to stay in the UK.

Specially trained family case workers will in future work with families throughout the asylum decision making process. Once a family's appeals have been exhausted they will be offered support through a new process. It will include:

  * family conferences to discuss their return home, welfare and medical concerns and offer families tailored assisted voluntary return packages;
  * assisted voluntary return packages to help them resettle upon their return;
  * required returns for families who fail to take up the assistance package, allowing them to remain in the community, but giving two weeks notice to board their flight home and allowing families to self check-in without the need for enforcement action; and finally
  * an ensured return, as a last resort. If they fail to depart the UK, UKBA will consider a range of options to ensure the return of families which will be tailored to each family's circumstances. Return plans will be agreed by a new independent panel. New options being developed include a form of short notice removal, the use of open accommodation, and - as a last resort where families resolutely fail to comply - family friendly, pre-departure accommodation, where we will allow children to have the opportunity to leave the premises subject to a risk and safeguarding assessment and suitable supervision arrangements.

An Independent Family Returns Panel is being set up to ensure that child welfare and safeguarding issues are central to individual family return plans.

Michael Moore said:

""Today's announcement is a huge change for the better in our immigration system and brings the unacceptable practice of detaining children to an end.

""In Scotland, Dungavel was closed to children when the Coalition came to power in May.  Now Yarl's Wood will close too.

""This change in approach is long overdue.  Our asylum and immigration systems should be fair, humane and effective.  This government is ensuring that happens.

""This was a key pledge in the coalition agreement. It puts the welfare of vulnerable children and their families at the centre of our system for the first time and brings in a new level of professional oversight through the creation of the Independent Family Returns Panel.

""I look forward to working closely with the Scottish Government where this new policy has implications for devolved matters.""

"Michael Moore today welcomed the announcement that a Scottish Consortium has been successful in the second round of bidding for a share of a £20m fund to install local charging points for electric cars.

Mr Moore said:

""Today's announcement that motorists will be able to make a choice from at least nine vehicles further confirms the UK as a global front runner in ultra-low emission cars and a leader in the development of hi-tech green manufacturing.

""Ultra-low emission cars with mass appeal used to be a pipe dream, but now they are set to become reality giving the convenience of the car without the pollution that goes with a normal car.

""It also shows that we are following through on our coalition commitment to support green growth and build a new and more responsible economic model and contribute towards our compliance with European Air Quality Targets.""

The consortia, with Transport Scotland as the lead partner, has been awarded £1.45m towards a total cost of £3.1m to roll out 375 charge points across central Scotland - 60 Home charge points, 285 public and 30 workplace.

The announcement by the Coalition Government firmly places the UK into the fast lane of the electric and ultra-low emission car revolution today as nine trailblazing models that will be eligible for generous grants of up to £5,000 were unveiled. The grant will be available to motorists across the UK from 1 January 2011, reducing the cost of eligible cars by a quarter, up to a maximum of £5,000.

The first nine cars to become eligible for eco-friendly car grants are: Mitsubishi iMiEV; smart fortwo electric drive; Peugeot iON; Citroen CZero; Nissan Leaf; Tata Vista EV; Toyota Prius Plug-in; Vauxhall Ampera and Chevrolet Volt. More will follow next year.

The successful bidding consortia in this second phase are based in: the Midlands; Greater Manchester; East of England; Scotland and Northern Ireland.

"The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore MP today announced the appointment of Mrs Paula Sharp as a member of the Boundary Commission for Scotland.  The appointment will commence on 1 January 2011 for a period of four years.  Mrs Sharp, who has been a self- employed management consultant since 1994, will replace Dr Elspeth Graham who has been a member of the Commission since 1999. 

Moore said: ""I am delighted Paula Sharp has accepted the post of Commissioner.  As a member of the Local Government Boundary Commission for Scotland, she brings with her invaluable knowledge, skills and expertise and will no doubt make a great contribution to the work of the Parliamentary Commission. I must also pay tribute to the long service and contribution of Dr Elspeth Graham who will leave her post at the end of the year.

""I am also pleased that Ken McDonald has agreed to serve for a further 4 year term from June 2011.""

Mr McDonald was first appointed to the Commission in June 2007.

The Boundary Commission for Scotland is an Advisory Non-departmental Public Body that is sponsored and wholly funded by the Scotland Office. It is an independent, non-political body constituted by the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986.  The Commission is responsible for reviews of:

  * constituencies and regions for the Scottish Parliament; and
  * constituencies in Scotland for the Westminster Parliament.

Its duties and powers in relation to reviews of constituencies for the Westminster Parliament are expected to change following the passage of the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Bill, currently under consideration by Parliament.  The Bill is expected to result in the reduction of the number of Westminster constituencies in Scotland from 59 to 52, and much greater equality of elector numbers between constituencies.  As a result of the Bill, the Commission expects to complete a review of Westminster constituencies between early 2011 and 2013, which will result in substantial redrawing of Westminster constituency boundaries.

Mrs Sharp has been a member of the Local Government Boundary Commission for Scotland (LGBCS) since November 2007.  She was recently re-appointed for a further 3 years.

"The Secretary of State Michael Moore has today given his backing to improvements to the Military Covenant which will affect Scots serving in the UK Armed Forces.

He has also called for Holyrood and Westminster to continue to develop arrangements for working together in providing services for present personnel and veterans, along with their families.

The Armed Forces Bill which was brought forward today will require the Defence Secretary to present an Armed Forces Covenant report to Parliament every year, setting out how the UK Government is supporting the Armed Forces.

An independent report on innovative ways to improve the Military Covenant - the bond between the nation and its military personnel, past and present - by Professor Huw Strachan  was published alongside the Bill.

It looks at ways in which government and others can build on their support for the armed forces community and makes a number of recommendations. The UK Government will accept two of those immediately - the Community Covenant and Chief of Defence Staff Commendations. A full response will be given in Spring next year.

The Armed Forces Community Covenant will involve regionally-based schemes to encourage local authorities, organisations and individuals to champion the links between the Armed Forces and their communities.

The Chief of Defence Staff Commendation will provide a visible demonstration of appreciation for the good work carried out by wider society for members and former members of the Armed Forces and their families and will be launched next year. These could be given to individuals, groups, businesses or even towns which have shown exemplary support for the Armed Forces.

Key areas such as healthcare, housing and education are devolved to the Scottish Parliament and the UK Government will continue to work with the devolved administration in Edinburgh to deliver services - including those reserved to Westminster - to personnel and their families in the most effective way.

Michael Moore said:

""There is no doubt we need to do more to help our Armed Forces, their families and our veterans. That is why this Government has committed to re-shape the Military Covenant, recognising the huge debt we owe to those who put their lives on the line for our country.

""I know how proud Scots are of our forces and I welcome the move to strengthen links between the military and our communities as well as the prospect of those who go the extra mile being recognised under the new Commendation scheme. We are well placed to set an example here in Scotland, particularly as we will see Edinburgh host Armed Forces Day next year.

""Service families have to access a wide range of local services, from schooling to welfare and healthcare. Scotland's two governments are working well together on this issue and will continue to do so.""

"Rural areas in scotland ""Must seize Broadband opportunity""

UK Government announces plan to put ""digital hub"" in every community

Rural areas in Scotland are set to benefit from Westminster's commitment to the next phase of superfast broadband plans.

The UK Government has pledged to invest £830 million in the strategy with the aim of ensuring the UK has the best broadband network in Europe by the end of the next Parliament in 2015.

Britain's Superfast Broadband Future was published by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport earlier this week and sets out a plan to create a reliable and secure broadband network across the country.

Proposals include the creation of a digital hub in every community by 2015 and sets out how, for communities which cannot access a good level of connectivity, public investment will be used to support existing broadband development plans.

The plan will also invest £50 million in a further wave of projects  to test how to deliver superfast broadband to remote and rural areas - one of the first four pilots announced earlier this year included Highlands & Islands. It is hoped supplier will begin to roll-out upgraded infrastructure within a year, allowing internet service providers to use those network to offer affordable service to homes and businesses.

The Government aims to see all homes receiving a 2 Mbps broadband service by 2015 and as many as possible benefitting from superfast broadband.

The Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore said:

""Rural areas across Scotland should welcome this initiative, which will help bridge the digital divide and give local communities access and security of service in the future within just a few years. Rural areas have been left behind too long and we must seize this opportunity to give them online services suitable for the 21st century.

The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Scotland Office David Mundell said:

""The superfast network is a major piece of infrastructure and a priority across the country. Those Scots living outside our urban areas understand all too well how important it is to have reliable, fast connections whether for business or in the home. I welcome this new phase of work to improve the broadband network which will not only benefit our economy but improve life in rural Scotland at the same time.""

BT has recently announced it will contribute further funding to supplement any public money it wins for the roll-out of rural broadband.

""Britain's Superfast Broadband Future"" is available at the Department for Business, Innovation & Skills website.

The Government's £830 million investment consists of £530 million by 2015 confirmed in the spending review in October, and £300 million by 2017 as part of the TV licence fee settlement. It is intended to stimulate additional private investment.

"Michael Moore has welcomed the news that Her Majesty's Revenue & Customs (HMRC) has relaxed the rules on the use of red diesel by farmers who are helping to grit or and clear snow from public roads during the current weather conditions.

The Minister said:

""This is a sensible decision given the incredibly tough conditions we are facing this winter. In times of severe weather, farmers are essential in clearing roads and allowing our communities to go about their business, allowing vital supplies to get through, or families to check in on vulnerable people as well as keeping local economies moving.

""When resources on the ground are stretched, we have to adapt our approach to ensure the safety of people who may otherwise struggle or be in danger.""

Under normal rules any vehicle that is specifically constructed or adapted for dealing with frost, ice and snow - such as a snow plough - can work on public roads while using red diesel.

HMRC recognises the vital role played by farmers in helping to keep rural roads clear. During this period of extreme weather HMRC will adopt a pragmatic approach to the rules. This means tractors on public roads clearing snow or gritting to provide access to schools, hospitals, a remote dwelling, or communities cut off by ice and snow are entitled to use red diesel.

More details can be obtained by calling the Excise and Customs Helpline on 0845 010 9000.

"The new coalition government has pursued an agenda of mutual respect with the devolved administrations since coming to power. We will continue to do so as we believe it is in the best interests of Scotland for its politicians to work together. Respect, however, does not mean we will always agree. The path of our country's constitutional future is a topical and pressing case in point. There is no escaping the fact the UK has to act decisively to meet the challenges of the financial crisis and the deficit legacy this government has inherited. That requires action which fits the task at hand. That is equally true of the Calman recommendations - they fit the time and purpose before them.

The Final Report of the Commission pulled off a remarkable feat. It balanced equity, efficiency and  accountability and created a way forward for Scotland which provides the basis for a logical next step for devolution. That was what it was tasked to do and it delivered, accepting the continuing reservation of macroeconomic policy to Westminster in the context of the continuing social and economic union of the UK.

I have been clear since being appointed as Secretary of State that this government is pressing ahead with implementing the recommendations of the Calman Commission. It is not considering alternative fiscal models.

This has been stated in the coalition agreement, in the Queen's Speech, by the Prime Minister, my own appearance at the Scottish Parliament and by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury in his historic visit to Holyrood's finance committee.

There should not be any doubt about the direction in which the UK Government is moving but neither should anyone doubt the solid reasons behind that position. We have a Scotland Bill being drafted and the implementation groups getting underway: in short, the Calman process is already moving and has momentum, support and depth of thinking in its favour. Our process is about focus and delivery.

We will implement the Calman proposals to make them work as efficiently as possible and that means we are open to suggestions which address technical  concerns. We have asked the Scottish Government to be a part of that process and they have already provided input.

But no one should interpret that flexibility as a sign Calman has been superseded by events.  The Express article of last Thursday said the ""Calman proposals are a halfway house and a messy fudge"". I do not believe that to be the case.

The Commission spent 13 months of intense consideration by the majority of political parties on how best to meet Scotland's needs and introduce fiscal accountability to the Scottish Parliament. This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to change our political landscape. We are dedicated to making it work as well as possible. Others have a prime opportunity to join us in that endeavour. The alternative is to sit out on the sidelines. I would prefer to see us work together.

All too often in recent weeks the arguments we have seen in for full fiscal autonomy have been heavy on assertion and light on detailed evidence. We must be precise when it comes to making calls for significant changes to the Scottish Parliament's financial accountability.

We also need to be clear that there is not, as claimed in some quarters, an ""overwhelming consensus"" to move to fiscal autonomy at this time. We must not forget that the Calman Commission didn't consist of 15 men and women meeting in secret: it involved an extensive process of engagement across Scotland.  The Commission emphatically concluded that devolved government met the aspirations of the people of Scotland and worked well in practice.  All three UK parties share this view and all three included it in their manifestos in May. A strong mandate was achieved for Calman at the election.

It is now over a year since Sir Kenneth Calman's report and it has become embedded in our political discourse in Scotland.

Some may be blase about how radical the report's findings are but it is viewed very differently by the rest of us. The Calman recommendations are a substantial and substantiated review of the devolution settlement.  We are not talking about tweaking the existing settlement.

Calman will produce real-world change: it will ensure that existing political accountability at the ballot box will be enhanced by substantially increased financial accountability for the Scottish Parliament and the Government formed from it.

With this enhanced devolution, we will continue to benefit from being a fundamental part of the world's sixth largest economy. We have the resilience associated with diversification across many economic sectors. Our tax system allows us totally unimpeded access to the world's oldest free trade area.  We spread the costs of nationhood across 60 million people rather than 5 million. The Calman proposals build on those undeniable strengths while strengthening financial accountability within Scotland and that is why we are taking them forward into a Scotland Bill this autumn.

"On Tuesday I will have the privilege of being the keynote speaker at The Scotsman's retail business summit, organised in association with the Scottish Retail Consortium.  At the heart of my message to delegates will be the new coalition's commitment to back business to build a strong, sustainable recovery.

Scotland's varied retail sector is one of our great economic successes.  However, times are tough.  Established retailers are operating in a harsher and more competitive environment. 

I believe that it will be business with retail at the forefront which will power Scotland out of recession.  However, business leaders tell me of the pressing need to restore confidence in the marketplace and among consumers.

The government's first step has been to implement a credible plan to cut the unsustainable budget deficit.  Nobody should underestimate the magnitude of this task.

The structural deficit we inherited three weeks ago is the largest since records began.  Recent events in the Eurozone reinforces the importance of taking action this year.  Unless the government tackles the huge public debt it could derail the recovery.  We are committed to significantly accelerate the reduction of the structural deficit during the lifetime of this Parliament. 

Last week we announced £6 billion of UK spending cuts.  As we take this first step on the road to restore sound management to our public finances we will make every effort to protect key frontline services and those on the lowest incomes.

We will detail our comprehensive plans for deficit reduction in the emergency growth budget on 22 June and in the full Spending Review reporting in the autumn.

The action we have taken will help keep interest rates lower for longer, boost economic confidence and protect jobs.

We know that paying a share of the deficit falls on Scotland too.  Without stronger finances we will be unable to deliver the ambitions we have for Scotland.

I want to see a prosperous, business friendly Scotland.  Where it is easier for enterprising Scots to get new companies up and running.  Where the barriers which stifle businesses and employment are pulled down.  Where a simpler and fairer tax and benefits system actively encourages employment.

Fairer taxes will help Scots on lower and medium incomes and realise our longer term aim of increasing the personal allowance to £10,000.  A reformed benefits regime will improve work incentives and lift hundreds of thousands of Scots stuck on benefits back to work and out of poverty. 

We are committed to unlocking all of Scotland's rich talent.  With the aim of supporting sustained green growth and the building of a more responsible economic model.  One key ingredient is the provision of affordable credit to our viable and vital SMEs.  Which must be delivered by a reformed banking sector promoting responsible banking in a more competitive industry.  
                      
I believe that our efforts to secure economic recovery can take place alongside a transformation in our politics. 

David Cameron emphasised in Edinburgh that we have embraced a respect agenda where cooperation not confrontation is key.  That means positive engagement with the Scottish Government - because we understand that a good relationship between Westminster and Holyrood serves Scotland well.

Respect and cooperation is the way forward.  The best path to ensure economic recovery.  Retail will play a crucial role in the upturn and this Government is committed to backing business-led growth across Scotland.
