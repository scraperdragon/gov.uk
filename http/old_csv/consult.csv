It supplies a typology of undeveloped land and external benefits offered by each land type resulting in a matrix of potential values. The report generates a summary of existing values for benefits from certain land types found in the valuation literature and makes recommendations for further work to fill crucial gaps.

Alongside the joint Communities and Local Government/Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) consultation the Community Energy Saving Programme, and DECC's consultation on the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target uplift, the Heat and Energy Saving Strategy will help formulate a successful strategy for national and local government to help people individually, and as a part of their community, to heat and power their homes and businesses.

Britain's homes and buildings are using energy inefficiently and wasting heat and power at an unsustainable rate. As a result, the average household could be throwing away over £300 a year on energy. We can all benefit from better energy efficiency, but the impact of lower bills could be felt most by the 2.75 million vulnerable households currently suffering fuel poverty. Working together, we know we need to transform the attitudes and actions of us all when it comes to heat and energy efficiency. We need a radical shift in our use of energy and heat in our homes to meet our ambition of an 80 per cent CO2 reduction by 2050.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/communityenergysaving,Community Energy Saving Programme (CESP) consultation,"The Government is consulting on proposals for the Community Energy Saving Programme (CESP). The broad policy proposals for the design of the programme include:

  * placing an obligation on energy suppliers and electricity generators to meet a CO2 reduction target by providing energy efficiency measures to domestic consumers.
  * requiring that this obligation is met by providing these measures to households in areas with high levels of low incomes.
  * to offer these measures as a package to homes, to deliver a 'whole house approach' - so that homes can receive all the major energy efficiency measures they need, which could also include district heating schemes.
  * specifying that only certain measures are eligible to count towards the CO2 targets, focusing on those measures which can make a substantial difference to a household emissions and fuel bills.

On September 11 2008 the Prime Minister announced a package of initiatives designed to help people to reduce their fuel bills whilst also ensuring that the most vulnerable receive help this winter. One element of this package was the Community Energy Saving Programme. It aims to deliver around £350m of energy efficiency packages. Reducing energy use also helps tackle climate change, and CESP will contribute to our ambition of an 80 per cent CO2 reduction by 2050.

In summary:

  * Digital technologies pervade every aspect of modern society.

The provisions will also resolve the problem for the vast majority of existing tolerated trespassers.    
  
However, there is one group of existing tolerated trespassers which is not covered by the provisions in the 2008 Act. While the provisions cover all situations in which the tolerated trespasser's landlord remains the same, they do not apply where ownership of the property has passed to a new landlord, so-called 'successor landlord cases'. However, the 2008 Act gives the Government the power to extend the provisions for existing tolerated trespassers to successor landlord cases. This consultation paper - which is issued on behalf of Communities and Local Government and the Welsh Assembly - considers options for using this power.

The consultation closed on the **10 November 2008**.

The draft Regulation lays out the conditions for CE marking for construction products: a 'passport' which demonstrates that a product has been assessed against a harmonised European standard, and should therefore be accepted onto the market anywhere in the European Economic Area (EEA).

The proposed Regulation will replace the Construction Products Directive (89/106/EEC, as amended by Directive 1993/68/EEC - the CPD). The aim of the revision is to address some perceived problems with the text of the current Directive and the ways in which it has been implemented, rather than to completely revise the practical processes for CE marking of products, which are already established in all Member States.

The main implication for the UK in the proposals is that it will become mandatory for construction products which fall under the scope of the Regulation to make a declaration of their performance, and to carry the CE marking to demonstrate this, before they can be put on the market in the UK. Currently the UK is one of four Member States that has voluntary CE marking.

Alongside the consultation paper the Department has published a draft impact assessment paper: _The European Commission's proposed Construction Products Regulation:_ _Impact Assessment_ (see link on right). We would also welcome any views you may have on this impact assessment by 10 November 2008.

The Department has also commissioned a report: _Review of the operation and impact of the Construction Products Directive in the UK through the Construction Products Regulations 1991_ (see link on right) on the impacts of mandatory CE marking in the UK, which has been published alongside these documents.

  * the requirement to demonstrate that the actual as built CO2 emission rate (DER/BER) does not exceed the target CO2 emission rate (TER) for the building concerned

Under existing building regulations there are two separate requirements to carry out CO2 emission rate calculations. These two requirements are dealt with separately in both the Building Regulations 2000 and the Building (Approved Inspectors etc) Regulations 2000, with separate arrangements for showing compliance with each requirement.

Inevitably, however, it will not always be possible for parties to resolve disputes themselves and so an effective and meaningful third party resolution system needs to be available. The consultation seeks to elicit views on what is the most appropriate system.

  * Improved consultation arrangements - Giving the public more opportunity to get involved at the beginning of the process;
  * Revisions to the procedure of plan making - final representations on the plan to be made before it is submitted to the independent Inspector; and
  * Changing the way Supplementary Planning Documents are produced.

Changes to PPS12 include:

  * Emphasising the key role the Core Strategy plays;
  * Emphasising the need for making progress with Local Development Frameworks (LDFs);
  * Giving local planning authorities more flexibility to produce only the plans that are needed; and
  * Repackaging the tests of soundness to give greater clarity whilst not altering the basis for examination of plans.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/sharedownership,Shared Ownership and Leasehold Enfranchisement - Consultation,"This consultation describes proposed changes to current leasehold enfranchisement rules to simplify and clarify the position in relation to shared ownership. The proposals would remove the possibility of shared owners being able to enfranchise (buy their freehold) before they have bought 100 per cent of a property under the terms of their shared ownership lease.  
  
It also proposes a power to restrict staircasing (the purchasing of additional equity shares) on shared ownership properties in certain limited geographical areas in future. This would ensure that particular properties remain affordable and available on shared ownership terms in perpetuity. The use of this power would be limited to areas where this type of housing was particularly difficult to replace.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/archived/publications/housing/residentialleaseholdmanagement,Improving the standard of residential leasehold management: consultation,"The first chapter of this consultation paper looks at the current state of the residential leasehold management sector. It looks at the different types of manager in the leasehold sector, explores the problems that can be caused where those managers fail to meet standards, the scope for dealing with those problems through existing controls and the goals that we would like to achieve through improved management standards. It also briefly examines the wider context.

Chapters 2,3, & 4 look at three different methods which we could use to improve the standards of residential leasehold management. The first would involve a licensing scheme. The second would involve giving a regulatory body the power to ban certain individuals or organisations from carrying out leasehold management functions (referred to as a ""regulatory scheme""). The third would make use of voluntary methods such as accreditation schemes and self-regulation by relevant trade bodies (referred to as ""voluntary controls""). In judging the relative merits of these options, we have been guided by the general principles put forward under the Government's ""Better Regulation"" initiative (which are summarised in Chapter 1).

  * update our analysis of how the housing market is currently working, using the latest findings from the HIP Baseline Research;
  * set out the role of the Home Information Pack in the action to cut carbon emissions and the wider reform of the home buying and selling process; and
  * explain how we intend to ensure the smooth introduction of HIPs on 1 June 2007 and take account of information from the area trials, the Baseline Research and discussions with stakeholders.

Views were sought on the proposals outlined in the paper by 21 February. This deadline was subsequently extended to 22 February. A total of 280 responses were received. These included 65 from Search organisations, 40 conveyancers/solicitors, 39 local authorities, 29 from estate agencies, 17 from energy and water suppliers/ organisations, 10 from HIP providers and 5 responses were received from the mortgage lending industry. 48 people responded in an individual capacity.

PPS25 sets out Government policy on development and flood risk. Its aims are to ensure that flood risk is taken into account at all stages in the planning process to avoid inappropriate development in areas at risk of flooding, and to direct development away from areas of high risk. Where new development is, exceptionally, necessary in such areas, policy aims to make it safe, without increasing flood risk elsewhere, and, where possible, reducing flood risk overall. PPS25 was published on 7 December 2006, together with a _Consultation on Planning Policy Statement 25: Development and Flood Risk - A summary of responses_ and _Planning Policy Statement 25: Development and Flood Risk - Full Regulatory Impact Assessment_.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/archived/publications/housing/definition2,Definition of the term 'gypsies and travellers' for the purposes of the Housing Act 2004 - Summary of Responses,"The Department for Communities and Local Government received 38 responses to its consultation paper, 'Definition of the term 'gypsies and travellers' for the purposes of the Housing Act 2004'.

Section 225 of the Housing Act 2004 (the Act) places a duty on local housing authorities to undertake regular assessments of the accommodation needs of 'gypsies and travellers' either living in, or resorting to their area, under the Local Housing Needs Assessment process set out in Section 8 of the Housing Act 1985. The Act also requires local housing authorities to include the needs of 'gypsies and travellers' in any housing strategy they produce in line with section 87 of the Local Government Act 2003 and to take any such strategy in to account in exercising their functions.

Section 225(5)(a) provides that the term 'gypsies and travellers' has the meaning given by regulations made by the appropriate national authority. In relation to England the appropriate national authority is the Secretary of State and this power is being exercised by the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government. The Government therefore consulted on a definition of 'gypsies and travellers' which will apply when local housing authorities are carrying out accommodation assessments and preparing accommodation strategies in respect of this group.

The consultation exercise ran for 12 weeks from 2 February 2006 until 28 April 2006 although late responses were accepted after this date.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/independentreview2,Independent review of regulation of social housing: Issues paper for residents,"The Secretary of State has commissioned a widespread review of the regulation of social housing.

One of the principal objectives of the review is to identify the regulatory framework which will be most effective in securing high quality service delivery.

We are keen for residents to engage with the review and submit evidence. We see residents as the first of two principal 'customers' of social housing (the other customer being the taxpayers who fund this development and regulation).  We want the regulatory arrangements to ensure that housing services are high quality and value for money and that residents have an effective say in how they are designed and delivered. We also want to explore how residents can play a more influential role in the regulation of social housing.

This paper focuses on issues that we are considering, and that we believe will be important to residents. However we are keen to receive all views on the issues, whether they are consistent with or different from our thoughts. We recognise that we cannot presume that our judgement of this will necessarily be right, and if you feel that our assessment of the issues is incomplete or incorrect, then it is important to us that submissions to the review set out alternative views.

The paper has been circulated electronically and is available on the DCLG website. Hard copies can be obtained by contacting the address below.

This consultation is a limited technical consultation rather than a full public one. For this reason a Regulatory Impact Assessment has not been undertaken at this stage. Early indicators are that the proposals in this paper will not impose any additional burdens on local government, business or the voluntary sector.

As this paper only consults on the indicators that it is proposed will form the formula for arriving at a regional split of the RHP, it is not possible at this stage to assess fully the impact on BME and other minority groups. Therefore, a Race Equality Impact Assessment is not attached to this paper. One will be prepared as part of our proposed consultation on the whole formula during Summer 2007. In the meantime, the Technical Note to this paper sets out for each proposed indicator a very initial assessment of its possible impact on BME groups where appropriate and where adequate data is available. It is anticipated that the aggregate impact on BME and other minority groups of these indicators will be positive.

Comments on the proposals in this paper should be provided by **Friday 16 February 2007**. They should be sent, preferably by e-mail, to

This consultation paper sets out principles and potential options that the Government could use to develop a new housing and planning delivery grant. The paper canvasses a range of potential elements that could feature in the design of a housing and planning delivery scheme.

The Government wishes to take the views of stakeholders into account in the design of a new grant and would welcome comments on the proposals and alternative approaches for consideration.

There will however be a need to strike a balance between designing a simple and transparent scheme, and including a range of elements that meet our policy objectives, but will not add to the complexity of the scheme. The Government would also welcome views on how to best maintain this balance.

In conjunction with this consultation paper the Government is also consulting on the final year of the current Planning Delivery Grant allocations.

This draft regulation relates to the Section 257 houses and it applies licensing and management regulations to those buildings. The regulations are being published in draft to give stakeholders an opportunity to provide comments on the drafting, accuracy and practical application of the provisions set out in the regulations.

This is a similar exercise to that carried out in December 2005 for the earlier set of regulations relating to HMO and Selective Licensing. This is part of a process aimed at ensuring that the regulations work effectively when the relevant provisions of the Housing Act 2004 are applied to Section 257 Houses.

This is not a formal public consultation exercise but is aimed at key stakeholders and practitioners. However comments received from other interested persons will be dealt with in the usual way.

We are not seeking comments on wider issues relating to these types of HMOs or the licensing policy, as these had been the subject of earlier consultation exercises and this exercise is not intended to revisit the decisions made as a result of those consultations. It is intended that these regulations will come into force in October 2006.

But we would welcome your views to contribute to our thinking. Specifically we are looking for views on:

  * getting the most out of existing public sector investment and assets;
  * ways to improve planning for affordable housing at the local level,including a stronger role for local authorities;
  * ways to lever in additional resources and assets to support social and affordable housing in particular from the private sector; and
  * ways to strengthen tenants role in decisions on social housing.

People want to live in safe, sustainable communities. Tackling anti-social behaviour and delivering respect is essential in building those communities.

We invited views on a proposal which we believe will help local authorities ensure that those in their area who are best placed to tackle anti-social behaviour can do so efficiently. This proposal would make it possible for local authorities to be able to ask those managing their housing under s.27 of the _Housing Act 1985_ also to carry out all or some of their ASBO functions on their behalf. This would include Arms Length Management Organisations (ALMOs), Tenant Management Organisations (TMOs) and those managing stock as part of Private Finance Initiative (PFI) schemes (where these are not an ALMO, TMO or RSL).

The power to enable local authorities to make arrangements for their ASBO functions to be exercised by other bodies is in section 1F of the _Crime and Disorder Act 1998_. The Secretary of State would need to make an Order under that Act to allow authorities to contract their ASBO functions to housing management organisations and this would need to be approved by both Houses of Parliament.

This document summarises the responses that have been received in respect of the Consultation which closed on 1 February 2006.

It will range across the prevention, support and enforcement agendas placing a strong emphasis on engaging and empowering residents. 

We do not want to impose a standard on landlords but rather want to work with the sector and other key stakeholders, not least residents, in developing a robust and clear standard that builds on existing best practice.

Consultees were asked for their views on an acceptable period of time for a property to be left unoccupied before local  authorities contemplated an EDMO; whether there should be specific exceptions to the legislation for particular classes of property, eg second homes and how EDMOs should apply to dwellings subject to a lease.

This publication summarises the responses to these questions and the Government's view on the main comments received which will inform secondary legislation.

This consultation examines the future role of LSPs, their governance and accountability, and their capacity to deliver Sustainable Community Strategies and Local Area Agreements (LAAs).

These draft regulations cover:

  * the scope of mandatory licensing for Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs);
  * the circumstances when persons are to be regarded as being in the same household for Part 2 of the Act;
  * the circumstances when persons are to be treated as occupying  premises as their only or main residence for Part 2 of the Act;
  * the contents of applications for licences under Parts 2 and 3 of the Act;
  * the standards to be applied when determining the suitability of an HMO for licensing under Part 2 of the Act;
  * the publication requirements for designations and revocations under Part 2 or 3 of the Act;
  * the information to be contained in registers of licences, temporary exemption notices and management orders under Part 2 of the Act;
  * the buildings that are not HMOs for the purposes of the Act (other than for Part 1);
  * the rules relating to the management of HMOs;
  * tenancies and licences that are exempt from selective licensing under Part 3 of the Act;
  * the circumstances in which a special interim management order can be made under Part 4 of the Act .

We are not seeking comments on wider issues relating to the licensing policy, as these were the subject of earlier consultations a year ago and this exercise is not intended to revisit the decisions made as a result of that consultation.  
Final versions of the Instruments will be laid in Parliament in the week commencing 30 January 2006 and the provisions will come into force on 6 April 2006.

These regulations exclude Section 257 HMOs (converted blocks of flats) from the provisions.  A separate set of regulations applying licensing and management regulations is being prepared to cover those buildings and will be published in draft in the week commencing 30 January 2006.

A particular focus, through its licensing provisions, is to improve the management of the more difficult to manage properties in the private rented sector - _Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs)_.

The consultation paper, _Codes of practice for student accommodation: Approved Codes under Section 233 of the Housing Act 2004_ (ODPM September 2005) was concerned with 3 codes of practice that had been submitted to the Government and which the Government was minded to approve. These were:

  * The Universities UK/Standing Conference of Principals (SCOP) _Code of Practice for the Management of Student Housing_ applying to university managed and controlled accommodation;
  * The ANUK/Unipol _Code of Standards for Larger Developments for student accommodation managed and controlled by educational establishments_ applying to accommodation managed and controlled by institutions of higher education; and
  * The ANUK/Unipol _Code of Standards for Larger Developments for student accommodation not managed and controlled by educational establishments_ applying to accommodation managed and controlled by other bodies subject to HMO licensing.

The consultation paper made it clear that it was on the basis of compliance with the first two of these codes that higher or further education establishments could be granted exception from HMO licensing by secondary legislation under Schedule 14 of the Act.

This paper summarises the responses to the consulation and how the Government intends to proceed in light of those comments.

A third of respondents considered that the proposed deadlines allowed insufficient time to complete the process. 10 respondents suggested that the RFR could not be enforced by restrictive covenant, and instead required a legal charge on the property with the Land Registry.

Copies are being sent to the bodies listed at Annex B. The paper will be of particular interest to local government employees, their employers and the public sector unions. All authorities to which this consultation document is being copied are invited to draw it to the attention of their employees.

**Update November 2005:** In the period since our consultation on the review of the political restrictions framework and the draft code of conduct for local government employees ended, a number of relevant inquiries and consultation exercises have taken place on the ethical regime for local government.

These include the Inquiry of the Committee on Standards in Public Life (the Graham Committee) into ethical standards in local government, and an ODPM Select Committee Inquiry into the role and effectiveness of the Standards Board for England. Both Committees have since published their findings and recommendations for Government action.

In addition, the Standards Board has consulted on a review of the code of conduct for members, and will shortly make final recommendations to Ministers. Ministers therefore wish to consider the way forward on the employees' code of conduct and political restrictions as part of this wider review of the ethical framework for local government. This will ensure a comprehensive and integrated Government response on all the issues raised.

We will make a further announcement in due course.

Heritage protection and planning are undergoing a cultural change, to bring about greater openness, fairness, flexibility and accountability. The Government's aim is to continue to protect the historic environment, while enabling our historic assets to be better understood and managed, with more opportunities for people to get involved in decisions that affect the spaces and buildings around them.

The launch of this consultation paper on revised listing criteria is an important step forward. Publication of these criteria will enable everyone, from developers and planners to the people living in an area, to have an understanding of why we protect the historic assets that enhance our communities and help them retain their unique character. The forthcoming introduction of consultation with property owners and local authorities when an application for listing a building has been made will make public awareness of these criteria essential.

  * B1(a): offices;
  * B1(b): research & development; and
  * B1(c): Light Industry.

The paper is based upon the Bill as introduced into Parliament in December 2003. It is likely that the Bill will be amended during its progress through Parliament, and It may not be passed into law.

The 'right of first refusal' will apply also to Right to Acquire sales of housing association properties under section 16 of the Housing Act 1996. The Right to Acquire regulations will be amended at the appropriate time.

Like most of the other changes to the Right to Buy rules in the Housing Bill, the 'right of first refusal' is intended to come into effect two months after the Bill receives Royal Assent.

Assuming that it does so, the procedures and timescales will be prescribed in regulations made by the Secretary of State (in respect of England) and the National Assembly for Wales (in respect of Wales). This consultation paper only concerns how the proposed right of first refusal will operate in England.

Responses to the consultation are requested by no later than 30 June 2004.

The objective is to provide greater transparency and certainty for all stakeholders and help enable developers and local planning authorities to avoid the delays that sometimes occur under the current system. But the proposals also recognise that the ability to use negotiation to tailor contributions to the circumstances of an individual site is important. Flexibility is often essential to securing agreement on planning obligations.

It is proposed to reform planning obligations policy to improve negotiated planning obligations, and to legislate to enable the Government to establish a new optional planning charge, as an alternative to negotiated planning obligations.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/archived/publications/communities/eganreview,Egan Review of Skills (Consultation paper and consultation response),"The ""Egan Review of Skills"" was announced by the Deputy Prime Minister on 8 April 2003. Its primary focus is to consider the skills that built environment professionals need to help deliver the vision and aims set out in the ""Sustainable Communities Plan: Building for the Future"".

In taking forward his remit, Sir John Egan established a Task Group of individuals with broad experience across the sustainable communities agenda with the aim of :

  * Clarifying what 'sustainable community' means and how progress towards achieving a sustainable community might be measured in terms that are understandable to professionals and the public alike;
  * Clarifying the role of local authorities in delivering sustainable communities within their areas, including their responsibility to provide leadership and vision for all key players (including developers, local communities, etc);
  * Looking in detail at planning processes from both the developer's and the local authority's perspectives and identify areas where these can be made more efficient, effective, and collaborative; 

and

  * Considering the factors that encourage private developers to invest in particular areas, and the action local authorities need to take to create an environment conducive to investment that delivers sustainable communities.

Sir John and the Task Group sought views on a wide range of  issues which are set out in the attached consultation paper. The consultation, summary (and full) responses from a wide range of stakeholders are also provided here for reference purposes.

Reducing the number of empty homes reduces opportunities for petty crime and vandalism, arson and anti-social behaviour.

The regional referendum, as a referendum at regional level, falls under the remit of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act (PPERA) 2000 and the forthcoming Conduct of Referendums Order. PPERA however does not apply below the regional level. 

 

In December 2003, the Government therefore issued a consultation paper that discussed the provisions and rules that should govern the local referendums. It also considered how the local and regional referendums should be combined. 

 

Copies of the consultation paper were sent to all English local authorities and a range of bodies that had an interest in the issues. Responses were requested by 16 February 2004. 

 

This report examines the responses to this consultation paper.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/archived/publications/housing/homelessnesspriorityneeds,Homelessness priority needs categories: consultation on extending the categories,"The Government is proposing to extend the homelessness priority need categories by Order by the end of 2001. The Order is one mechanism we are using to fulfil the 1997 Manifesto pledge to strengthen the protection available to homeless people. We have consulted interested bodies on our proposals and have received a great deal of support for them. We have now issued our proposals for wider public consultation.

This will be of particular interest to professional bodies with an interest in social housing. The closing date for comments on these proposals is 21 September 2001.

In the Housing Green Paper (Quality and Choice: A decent home for all April 2000 - paragraph 9.55), the Government consulted on its proposal to extend the priority need categories to include homeless people who are vulnerable because:

  * they have an institutionalised or care background (such as care-leavers, those leaving prison and ex-servicemen); or
  * they are fleeing harassment or domestic violence

The Green Paper also proposed (paragraph 9.56) that all unintentionally homeless 16 and 17 year olds should be treated as being in priority need.

The responses to the Green Paper consultation indicated widespread support for these proposals and we are now seeking comments on the attached draft documents which will implement them.

This consultation exercise includes:

  * a draft Order to extend the priority need categories
  * the related draft amendments to the Code of Guidance on Parts VI and VII of the Housing Act 1996. These set out the Secretary of State's proposed statutory guidance (under section 182 of the 1996 Act) to support the Order
  * related draft good practice guidance and information to provide further guidance to local authorities on the implementation of the provisions of the Order in practice

This set out a range of measures to improve the contractual rights and obligations between the parties to an agreement and to modernise the regime applying to site licensing, so local authorities have the resources and right tools to take enforcement action when the need arises.

The consultation paper sought views on options to reform the buying and selling process of mobile homes and in particular, to combat unreasonable sale blocking. The paper also set out other reforms to the Mobile Homes Act 1983 to improve home owners' rights and reduce the scope for abuse. Other proposals were on increasing criminal sanctions for those who harass, intimidate or illegally evict people living in a mobile home and options to reform caravan site licensing under the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act 1960 - particularly to allow local authorities to charge for their services, to seek robust fines for breaches of licence conditions, do works in default and refuse to grant licences in certain circumstances.

This report succeeds the previous [environmental report for the revocation of the Yorkshire and Humber Regional Strategy](http://www.communities.gov.uk/archived/publications/planningandbuilding/revocationyhrss) which was consulted on between October 2011 and January 2012.

At the end of the period all consultation responses will be considered, including those already submitted during the earlier response period. Responses are invited on all aspects of the report and proposal including the supporting appendices.

In assessing the impacts of the revocation, the environmental report identifies adverse impacts that would arise from revocation of the Regional Strategy policies for the York Green Belt and identifies a mitigation measure that would remove the impact. This, retention of the relevant part of the Regional Strategy until the York Local Plan is in place, is also put forward as a reasonable alternative. The Government's policy is to protect Green Belts and considers the reasonable alternative to retain York Green Belt policies would be consistent with its current policy. The Government is therefore sympathetic to this option, subject to its consideration of the responses to the consultation. The Government will therefore consider carefully the adverse impacts on the York Green Belt identified in the environmental report; and would welcome views on these aspects, any suggestions for mitigation and in particular on the reasonable alternative of retaining the York Green Belt policies until the York Local Plan is adopted.

The Premium was subject to a consultation, _Technical Reforms to Council Tax_, which ended on 29 December 2011. The Government published its response on 28 May 2012 - which confirmed its intention to proceed with the Premium and stated that it will not be payable until a dwelling has been empty and unfurnished for two years and the maximum premium which an authority will be able to charge will be 50 per cent.

It will be for individual billing authorities to design their own schemes for applying the Premium in their local area. As part of this, they will determine both the circumstances in which it may be charged, and the level at which it will be set. However, the Government believes that there are circumstances where it would be inappropriate for the Premium to apply.

This consultation seeks views on the Government's proposals on exceptions to the Premium - dwellings which may otherwise be liable for the Premium, but which are subject to circumstances which mean that it would not be appropriate for it to apply.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/businessratestechnical,Business Rates Retention: Technical Consultation,"This technical consultation builds on the proposals in the Government response to consultation published in December 2011, and on the statements of intent published on 17 May 2012.  
  
It seeks views on a range of detailed technical issues concerning practical implementation of those proposals, particularly focusing on how the Government proposes to calculate local authority start-up funding allocations, baseline funding levels as well as other parameters which are required for the setup and operation of the business rates retention scheme. As such, it will be of particular interest to local authority finance departments responsible for implementing and running the new scheme.

Section 2 focuses on establishing baseline funding levels for each local authority, as well as the methodology for allocating Revenue Support Grant which will be paid.

The December 2011 consultation response stated that, in the interests of maintaining as much stability as possible, these would be calculated on the basis of the 2012/13 formula grant process with updated data sets and some limited technical updates. This section details proposals for making those calculations and includes exemplifications of the proposed options. It also covers transfers and adjustments to the local government spending controls total and includes proposed methodologies for incorporating those separate grant funding streams being included in the business rates retention scheme from April 2013.

Section 3 outlines other parameters which need to be determined when setting up the business rates retention system - particularly in relation to establishing individual local authority business rate baselines.

Section 4 details proposals on how the system will operate once it has been set up. It is arranged chronologically, to give local authorities the best idea of how the scheme will operate year-by-year. The calculation of levy and safety net payments is set out in this section. The safety net will fall within the 7.5%-10% range and funded by a 1:1 levy as already announced.

Section 5 covers the proposed approach to closing the 2012-13 national non domestic rating account.  
  
The Department has published a number of documents to supplement the technical consultation on business rates retention. These documents set out the proposed approach for the London share of business rates and an alternative option for funding the New Homes Bonus. In addition, the Department has published supplementary information on proportionate shares as well as population data. These documents can be found below. Responses to additional consultation questions should be sent as part of the responses to the technical consultation.

He invited local authorities to consult people, ask them how they would like to see their local area improved and to take appropriate action to make it happen. The Localism Act has given them far more freedom and flexibility to do this.

If local authorities, having consulted and reached agreement with their local communities, find that a bureaucratic barrier prevents them from taking action, they can submit a formal 'proposal' under the Sustainable Communities Act 2007 asking Government to remove the barrier through the online portal at [http://barrierbusting.communities.gov.uk](http://barrierbusting.communities.gov.uk/) (external link). This portal is also open to anyone who wishes to ask the Government to remove a barrier which is stopping local action.

In respect of the proposed new mandatory power, the consultation paper sought views on how this should be designed; the principles that should underpin it; in what circumstances landlords should be able to use the mandatory power; and, how often in practice they might seek possession using the mandatory power rather than on existing discretionary grounds.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/mobilehomeowners,A better deal for mobile home owners - Consultation,"This consultation proposes a number of reforms to the park homes sector, aimed at tackling a number of complaints made by residents of some mobile home site operators. These can include:

  * blocking an owner's sale of their home - without justifiable reason
  * neglecting their sites and failing to make adequate repairs; and
  * charging excessive pitch fees, breaching site rules and stopping owners from improving their homes. 

The measures are designed to ensure site operators who behave responsibly can continue to operate as they do already whilst the rogue operators are properly tackled - as well as being made to meet the cost of their negligence rather than the taxpayer picking up the bill.

The proposed changes include:

  * ensuring compliance with site licence conditions by enabling the courts to impose unlimited fines on operators who do not manage their sites properly
  * allowing local authorities to make a reasonable charge on site operators for their licensing services, which they are currently unable to do
  * giving local authorities the power to carry out works on sites in an emergency or where the site operator has been found guilty of a breach of the licence, and charge the cost back to them

The Localism Act provides a substantial and lasting shift in power away from central government and towards local people. The Government has given public authorities more powers and freedoms to conduct their business and deliver services to the public. This includes a major reduction in the 'oversight' role of central government. Public authorities must, therefore, accept responsibility for the consequences of their actions or omissions.

Part 2 of the Localism Act is about incentivising public authorities to comply with European law, in order to avoid any financial sanctions in the first place. The proposed policy statement sets out a fair, proportionate and reasonable approach for the use of Part 2. The statement has been developed with the Local Government Association and the Greater London Authority.

The new guidance is intended to assist authorities to take advantage of the provisions in the Localism Act 2011 which give back to local authorities the freedom to manage their own waiting lists, and make it easier for them to move existing social tenants to more suitable accommodation. It also encourages authorities to make use of the existing flexibilities within the allocation legislation to ensure that social homes go to people who need and deserve them the most.

Alongside the guidance, the Government is consulting on two sets of draft regulations relating to the Armed Forces. The regulations will ensure that former Service men and women who have urgent housing needs are given 'additional preference' (i.e. high priority) for social housing - so that they will be at or near the top of housing waiting lists; and that Service personnel who move from base-to-base do not lose their qualification rights.

Consultation on amendments to the 2011-12 Housing Revenue Account Subsidy Determination, amendments to the 2011-12 Item 8 Determinations, and the Item 8 Determinations which will apply from April 2012, take place under powers conferred by sections 80 and 87 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989.

We are consulting on five draft determinations:

  * The Settlement Payments Determination. This sets out the amount each local authority will either pay the Government or receive from the Government on 28 March 2012 in order to exit the current subsidy system, and the way in which the payments will be made.
  * The Limit on Indebtedness Determination. This places a cap on the amount of housing debt each council may hold.
  * The Housing Revenue Account Subsidy Amendment Determination for the year 2011-12. This adjusts the subsidy entitlement for this financial year in order to take account of the interest costs or savings arising from the settlement payments. These payments will be made before the end of the financial year.
  * The Item 8 Credit and Debt Amendment Determination for the year 2011-12. This enables the appropriate charges to be made between the Housing Revenue Account and a council's General Fund to reflect the borrowing costs or savings in this financial year arising from the settlement payments.
  * The Item 8 Credit and debit Determinations for 2012 onwards. This provides a framework for the Housing revenue Account ring-fence to continue to operate under a devolved system of funding.

Alongside the draft determinations, we are publishing the spreadsheet models which have been used to calculate the self-financing valuations, settlement payments and debt limits set out in the determinations. As part of the consultation we ask you to consider whether the data and calculation for your authority are correct.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/scaconsultation2011,Sustainable Communities Act 2007: Inspiring the Big Society - a consultation on regulations under the Sustainable Communities Act,"On 15 December 2010 the Secretary of State issued a second invitation to local authorities under the Sustainable Communities Act 2007 ('The Act'). He invited councils to consult people, ask them how they would like to see their local area improved and to take whatever action they see fit to make it happen.

If councils, having consulted and reached agreement with their local communities, find that a bureaucratic barrier prevents them from taking action, they can submit a formal 'proposal' asking Government to remove the barrier through the new online portal at [barrierbusting.communities.gov.uk](http://barrierbusting.communities.gov.uk/) (external link). This portal is also open to anyone who wishes to ask the Government to remove a barrier which is stopping local action. We would, for example, welcome requests to remove barriers from organisations such as town and parish councils, and County Associations of Parish Councils.

The Act was amended in April 2010 to allow the procedures for receiving, considering and deciding proposals under the Act to be improved.

The Act now allows the arrangements for the consideration of proposals submitted in response to the invitation to be set out in regulations, following a period of consultation. There will be no deadlines for the submission of proposals, which can now be submitted straight to the Government at any time. Information on the action the Government is taking on the proposals will be available online so that councils and communities can track progress.

The Act, and the proposed draft regulations set out in this consultation, is a means to hold government to account and ensure each proposal is given the fullest consideration.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/communities/csconsultresponses,Consultation on the future of the Citizenship Survey: Summary of responses,"As part of the current drive to deliver cost savings across government and to reduce the fiscal deficit, future Citizenship Surveys will be discontinued.

The Citizenship Survey is a complex and expensive survey to run, with the 2010-11 survey costing just over £4m. In this climate, decentralisation and community involvement are best assisted by practical programmes and policy initiatives, rather than this centrally run survey. As such, the substantial savings from the discontinuation of the Citizenship Surveys will be used to fund priority programmes, including those which directly promote integration and participation in communities.

In addition, we expect that academic and other external providers will continue to provide data and analysis where these are needed.

We are keen to move away from costly top-down monitoring and measurement of local policies. Local providers are best placed to decide which data are needed to inform local priorities and monitoring. Localism and decentralisation require that the data used to scrutinise local policies should be collected and be made transparently available locally. Such data can be shared amongst localities and with central government.

An overview of responses to all questions shows that:

  * There was strong support for the majority of the proposals on zero carbon non-domestic buildings, with 75 per cent or more respondents agreeing with six of the nine questions to which they could answer 'Yes'.
  * Around half of respondents were in favour of balancing on-site and off-site measures, with similar proportions supporting off-site rich and on-site rich measures. A significant proportion of developers/builders favoured the off-site rich scenario.
  * There was little support for the proposal to set a flat rate requirement above 100 per cent regulated emissions to account for unregulated emissions and there was a mixed reaction to the package of measures and proposals for next steps.
  * Overall, there were no marked sectoral differences in views and any differences were question-dependent. However, support for some of the proposals was less strong among the energy sector.
  * The overall numbers responding to each of the 13 questions ranged between 83 and 98, with all questions attracting a response rate of 75 per cent or more.

### Scope of consultation

Responses to a December 2008 consultation: _Definition of Zero Carbon Homes and Non-Domestic Buildings_ recognised the case for regulation. However, in the light of current economic conditions, it is also important to consider the costs and potential consequences of such regulation on economic recovery for the construction sector and balance these with the benefits of early certainty around a route-map for future regulatory steps.

This consultation therefore sets out policy principles and further modelling work, and seeks views on these and their implications for viability for individual developments and sectors. The proposal to apply the zero carbon standard to new public sector buildings (including some Crown Estate buildings, which are exempt from Building Regulations) is discussed separately.

Annex 2 of the consultation paper sets out a number of questions on which we are seeking views. To help our analysis of responses, we would be grateful if consultees could complete the MS Word version of the consultation questions which is available to download below.

The consultation closes on **26 February 2010**.

### Impact Assessment

Alongside this consultation, the department has published separately a preliminary scoping consultation stage impact assessment paper. We would also welcome any views you may have on the impact assessment by 26 February 2010.

The proposed replacement of Appendix C of the ODPM Circular 06/2004 _Compulsory Purchase and the Crichel Down Rules_ will clarify the considerations the HCA should take into account prior to submitting a CPO to the Secretary of State for confirmation. It will also set out the factors that the Secretary of State will take into account when considering whether or not to confirm an order. The ability of the HCA to seek to compulsorily purchase a particular piece of land will not detract from its ability to purchase that same land by agreement in the first instance.

The consultation closes on **6 November 2009**.

### Scope of consultation

The proposals concern the removal only of the restrictions on heat input/output and the number of storeys. There is no proposal to remove the provision that the construction of a masonry chimney cannot be self-certified as this is principally a structural safety issue. The Department does not consider that it would be appropriate to allow installers of combustion appliances to self-certify part of the structure of a building.

The primary objective is to achieve a higher level of compliance with building regulations for installations of larger combustion appliances or those in buildings over three storeys through self-certification. The Department considers that higher compliance levels would make a significant contribution to the reduction in CO2 emissions.  
  
A secondary objective is to relieve building control bodies from having to check all such installations, freeing scarce resources to be used in other areas of building control.

The key measures to be considered in the consultation relate to: air supply for combustion in airtight homes; better guidance on bio-fuel technology; whether carbon monoxide alarms should be mandatory for use with solid fuel appliances; concealed flues; pluming (discharge) from condensing boilers and bunding (secondary containment) of domestic oil tanks.

The consultation closed on **26 November 2009**.

### Scope of consultation

To take account of proposed new energy efficiency provisions under Part L of the Building Regulations, Approved Document (AD) J has been reviewed to ensure that combustion appliances can continue to function safely in homes with higher standards of air tightness. (A [consultation](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/partlf2010consultation) to raise the current energy efficiency standards under Part L of the Building Regulations was published on 18 June 2009). Other main drivers of the review are commitments made by the Government to consider guidance on biomass boilers and the provision of Carbon Monoxide (CO) alarms.

Following a stakeholder review of the current AD J there was broad agreement that the existing AD J guidance is working well, and that AD J requires only changes in respect to a number of specific areas.

Taking account of the stakeholder review, the approach adopted to the proposed revision of AD J is to preserve the existing guidance, making amendments only where required or merited based on robust evidence in order to minimise disruption and any additional compliance costs or administrative burdens on any stakeholder group.

The UK Government is currently considering transferring responsibility for Building Regulations in Wales to the Welsh Assembly, in which case these proposals will only apply in England.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/partlconsultresponses,Part L of the Building Regulations: Proposed new editions of the Approved Documents L - Consultation: Summary of responses,"This paper is a summary of the responses to the consultation paper, _Part L of the Building Regulations: Proposed new editions of the Approved Documents L_, which was issued by Communities and Local Government in June 2008. Responses were invited by 9 September 2008. The consultation package included the text of proposed 2008 editions of the Approved Documents L which would replace those which came into effect in April 2006.

A total of 43 written responses were received. This paper records the main points submitted in writing in response to the consultation.

The majority of respondents were content with the proposed changes to:

  * reflect legislative change
  * correct facts, and
  * improve style and presentation, though several felt there may be some scope for reducing the number of references and for further refinements in presentation

The consultation did not identify any impact on either the private or voluntary sectors that has not already been accounted for in previous Impact Assessments, and therefore no Impact Assessment has been produced.

When the consultation was published in June 2008 it was the intention to republish the Part L Approved Documents in the new style previewed in the consultation with a number of amendments and corrections which had been set out in annexes D and E of the consultation document.

However, with the forthcoming consultation on proposals to revise Part L in 2010, it has been decided to publish an addendum/corrigendum slip instead of republishing the 2006 Documents. The new style of approved documents will be taken forward in the 2010 Part L revision.

### Multi-foil Insulation

Many of the responses related to the references in the Approved Documents to BRE Document BR 443 including reference in paragraph 3.10.2 to multi-foil insulation. While there was a divergence of views, the greater part of respondents agreed that paragraph 3.10.2 is the guidance that should be given in relation to multi-foil insulation products, at least until such time as a valid European Technical Approval or an alternative method becomes available. Few respondents considered that the retention of the reference to BR 443 would change their behaviour.

Communities and Local Government commissioned an expert review by Professor Philip Eames of Loughborough University of the current scientific opinion on test methods for determining the thermal performance of building materials and structures. Professor Eames' report also considers the technical issues raised in the consultation responses. The Department has published the Professor Eames' findings in the report Multi-foil Insulation: BD 2768

A new Communities and Local Government Circular 06/2009 and a separate Divisional Letter on this consultation have also been issued.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/partlf2010consultation,Proposed Changes to Part L and Part F of the Building Regulations: A Consultation Paper,"This consultation sets out the proposed changes to Part L (Conservation of Fuel and Power) and Part F (Means of Ventilation) of the Building Regulations that are planned to come into force in 2010.

The consultation also proposes a range of measures, including a strategy for training and dissemination, designed to further improve the levels of compliance and performance in buildings.

The consultation closes on the **17 September 2009**.

### Scope of consultation

  * The Government set out in its _Building a Greener Future_ - _Policy Statement_ (July 2007) that **new homes** will be net zero carbon from 2016. As steps to achieving this target, energy efficiency standards for new homes are to be improved by 25 per cent in 2010 and 44 per cent in 2013 relative to current 2006 standards.

  * The Government also wants to introduce improved energy efficiency standards for **new non-domestic buildings**, and in its 2008 Budget announced an ambition for all new non-domestic development to be net zero carbon from 2019. We are therefore proposing a similar phased improvement beginning with 25 per cent in 2010 and plan to consult on the further trajectory towards zero carbon new non-domestic buildings later this year.

  * Government is also committed to addressing the energy efficiency of **existing buildings** and the consultation therefore proposes appropriate changes to the requirements when people elect to carry out building work to existing buildings.

  * When the proposed energy efficiency standards in Part L are strengthened in 2010 there is likely to be a tendency to more airtight buildings. It is therefore necessary to propose changes to Part F of the Building Regulations at the same time to ensure adequate means of ventilation is provided.

The UK Government is currently considering transferring responsibility for Building Regulations in Wales to the Welsh Assembly, in which case these proposals will only apply in England.

The Department convened Part L and F consultation workshops on 15 and 16 July 2009 respectively. If you were unable to attend these events copies of the presentations can now be downloaded from the AECOM website.

Sections 1 to 4 deal with the reasons why Ministers consider that separation is desirable, the form which an arms length body might take, the division of functions between the local authority and the arms length body and the financial arrangements. The remaining sections deal with the additional resources available for authorities setting up arms length arrangements, the proposed criteria for the allocation of those resources and the timetable.

The Department has been helped in working up these proposals by a Technical Advisory Group involving the Local Government Association, the Association of London Government, the Chartered Institute of Housing, HM Treasury and the Audit
